    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an excellent match. Therefore, **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance G:** Substance G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a compound that decomposes to yield heavy water. A metal deuteroxide fits this description, as they typically decompose upon heating to a metal oxide and heavy water. For example: M(OD)n → MₐOₑ + D₂O. So, **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released in the reaction and its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider some simple gas molecules:\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p = n)\n    *   HD: 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n)\n    *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n)\n    *   CO (¹²C, ¹⁶O): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n)\n    *   Since we've already identified D₂O, it is highly probable that Deuterium is involved in the reaction. Therefore, **W is very likely D₂ gas**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction and Identify X:** The reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Precipitate G (metal deuteroxide) + Gas W (D₂).\n    *   The reaction is described as violent.\n    *   A crucial clue is that \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards common reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   The problem also states that \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\" The deuterated analogs, LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride) and NaBD₄, fit this description perfectly.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that **X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic solvents like water. If liquid Y were D₂O, the reaction would be:\n        LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   Let's check if this reaction matches all the clues:\n        *   **X = LiAlD₄**: Fits the description of an organic reagent analog containing a heavy isotope.\n        *   **Y = D₂O**: A liquid.\n        *   **Reaction**: Violent. Yes.\n        *   **Gas W = D₂**: Matches our deduction (p=n).\n        *   **Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃**: Aluminum deuteroxide is a gelatinous precipitate. This fits.\n        *   **Heating G**: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O (B). This fits.\n    *   All clues align perfectly with X being LiAlD₄ and Y being D₂O.\n\n5.  **Confirm with the Final Clue:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   X (LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both functional groups to alcohols.\n    *   Ketone → Secondary alcohol\n    *   Carboxylic acid → Primary alcohol\n    *   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol, -OH, groups). A diol contains exactly **two oxygen atoms**. This confirms our identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are H(1), Li(3), Al(13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The question states that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminum. We use the mass number of its most common isotope, ²⁷Al. Mass = 27.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (H):** There are four atoms of Hydrogen, all of which are the isotope Deuterium (²H or D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative (summed) mass:** Mass of Al + Total mass of D = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clue about Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15. So, 277 K is approximately 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of ordinary water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an excellent match. Therefore, we can confidently identify **Substance B as D₂O (heavy water)**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The problem states that gas W is released, and its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Given that Deuterium (D) is involved, let's examine Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This makes **W = D₂** a very strong candidate.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Identify X and G:**\n    *   The reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Precipitate G + Gas W (D₂).\n    *   We are told the reaction is \"violent\".\n    *   A crucial clue is that \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This strongly suggests a common reducing agent. The most common hydride reducing agents are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their \"very close analogs\" containing a heavier isotope would be the deuterated versions: NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that **X is LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n    *   A violent reaction of a metal hydride with a protic solvent (like water) produces hydrogen gas and metal hydroxides. In our case, to produce D₂ gas, the liquid Y must be a source of deuterium, making **Y = D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   Let's check if this fits all the clues:\n        *   **X = LiAlD₄**: An analog of a common organic reagent containing a heavy isotope. (Checks out)\n        *   **Y = D₂O**: A liquid. (Checks out)\n        *   **Reaction**: Violent. (Checks out, LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water).\n        *   **Gas W = D₂**: Matches our deduction. (Checks out)\n        *   **Precipitate G**: The reaction produces Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide), which is a gelatinous precipitate. (Checks out)\n        *   **Heating G**: When heated, a metal deuteroxide decomposes to its oxide and heavy water: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases B (D₂O). (Checks out)\n\n4.  **Confirm with the Final Clue:** The problem states, \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid contains two oxygen-bearing functional groups: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   Ketone (>C=O) is reduced to a secondary alcohol (>CHOH). This functional group contains one oxygen atom.\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). This functional group also contains one oxygen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains a total of **two oxygen atoms**. This confirms our identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of *all* instances of these elements in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the isotopes.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its most common isotope is 27.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (H/D):** There are four atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2. The total mass contributed by these atoms is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of the masses = (Mass of Al) + (Total mass of D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a multi-step chemical puzzle. Let's break down the clues one by one to identify the substances involved.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The first concrete piece of information is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   To convert Kelvin to Celsius, we use the formula: °C = K - 273.15.\n    *   277 K is approximately 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water)**. This also tells us that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The problem states that gas W's molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Since we know Deuterium is involved, let's examine Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single Deuterium atom (symbol D or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A molecule of Deuterium gas (D₂) therefore contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   The number of protons equals the number of neutrons, so **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Identify G, Y, and X:**\n    *   The reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Precipitate G + Gas W (D₂).\n    *   We know that precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and heavy water (e.g., M(OD)n → Metal Oxide + D₂O). So, **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n    *   The reaction produces a metal deuteroxide (G) and deuterium gas (D₂). For this to happen, substance X must be a metal deuteride, and liquid Y must be D₂O. The reaction is described as violent.\n    *   The reaction is: X (Metal Deuteride) + Y (D₂O) → G (Metal Deuteroxide) + W (D₂).\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** We have two final, crucial clues about X:\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards common hydride reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) or Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs, NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄, fit the description perfectly.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid contains both a ketone functional group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). LiAlH₄ (and by extension, LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both of these groups to alcohols (-OH). The resulting product, a diol, would have exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n    Let's confirm with the full reaction using **X = LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride) and **Y = D₂O**:\n    LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It produces Al(OD)₃, which is a precipitate (G).\n    *   Heating Al(OD)₃ produces Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B).\n    All conditions are met. **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). We will use the integer mass numbers for the relevant isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the sum of the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminum.
