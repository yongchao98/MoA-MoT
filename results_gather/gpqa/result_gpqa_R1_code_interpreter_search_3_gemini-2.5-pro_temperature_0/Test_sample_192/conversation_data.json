    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars, let's call it `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, according to the relation:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5` or `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n    In astronomy, when discussing star counts as a function of parallax, `N(plx)` typically refers to the *cumulative* number of stars with a parallax greater than or equal to `plx`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to a star. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n    A larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and vice versa. Therefore, the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than `plx` is equivalent to the cumulative number of stars *within* a distance `r`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    We can substitute the parallax-distance relationship into the given star count equation. Let `N(r)` be the cumulative number of stars within a distance `r`.\n    Since `N ∝ plx⁻⁵` and `plx = 1/r`, we have:\n    `N(r) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    `N(r) ∝ r⁵`\n\n    This means the total number of stars observed up to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Determine the Quantity of Interest:**\n    The question asks for \"how the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative of the cumulative number `N(r)` with respect to `r`. Mathematically, this is `dN/dr`.\n\n    This quantity, `dN/dr`, represents the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `r` with a unit thickness.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative:**\n    We have the proportionality `N(r) ∝ r⁵`. We can write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n    `N(r) = k * r⁵`\n\n    Now, we differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r` to find `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n    `dN/dr = k * 5 * r⁴`\n\n6.  **Find the Final Proportionality:**\n    From the derivative, we can see that `dN/dr` is proportional to `r⁴`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance changes with distance `r` as `r⁴`. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) ~ r²\n    B) ~ r⁴\n    C) ~ r⁵\n    D) ~ r³\n\n    The correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

The relationship between parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) is an inverse one:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This means a larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and a smaller parallax corresponds to a larger distance.
