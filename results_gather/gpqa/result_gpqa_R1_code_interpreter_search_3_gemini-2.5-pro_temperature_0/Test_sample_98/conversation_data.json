    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated compounds, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This is a complex splitting pattern. For a signal to be a dtq, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), giving a **d**oublet (n+1=2).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), giving a **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n    *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), giving a **q**uartet (n+1=4).\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** Similarly, this pattern arises from a proton coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), giving a **d**oublet (n+1=2).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), giving a **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n    *   Another set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), giving a second **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe need to find the structure that has protons which would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. Let's analyze the structure corresponding to each option. The condensed formulas can be ambiguous, so we will deduce the structure and verify its molecular formula.\n\n*   **Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C = 1+1+2+1+2+1+1 = 9; H = 3+1+5+1+5+2+1 = 18; O = 2. So, C₉H₁₈O₂.\n    *   **Plausible Structure:** The most likely structure that fits this formula and could generate such complex signals is 4-ethyl-5-methylheptanoic acid. The condensed formula in the option is written in a non-standard way. Let's analyze this structure:\n        ```\n              (c)CH₂CH₃ (f)CH₂CH₃\n              |         |\n        (a)CH₃-CH(b)----CH(e)----CH₂(h)----COOH(i)\n        ```\n        This structure is actually **4-ethyl-5-methylheptanoic acid**. Let's check its formula: C = 7 (heptane chain) + 1 (methyl) + 2 (ethyl) = 10 carbons. This doesn't match.\n        Let's re-examine the structure based on the formula `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`. Let's assume it's `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`. This is **3,4-diethylhexanoic acid**. Let's check its formula: C = 6 (hexane chain) + 2*2 (ethyls) = 10 carbons. This also doesn't match the C9 formula.\n\n    There seems to be an inconsistency in the question's provided formulas. Let's re-evaluate all options based on their written formulas and analyze the resulting structures.\n\n*   **Option D: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH** -> **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    ```\n          (b)CH₃   (d)CH₃\n          |        |\n    (a)CH₃-CH(c)----CH(e)----CH₂(f)----COOH(g)\n    ```\n    *   **Proton H(e):** Coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet), H(d) (3H, quartet), and H(f) (2H, triplet). This gives a **dqt** (or **dtq**). This matches one of the signals.\n    *   **Other protons:** H(c) would be a doublet of septets (or qqd). H(f) protons would be a doublet of doublets. No other proton gives a `dtt`. So, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH** -> **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    ```\n                (e)CH₂CH₃ (g)CH₂CH₃\n                |         |\n    (a)CH₃-CH₂(b)-CH(c)-----CH(d)-----COOH(i)\n    ```\n    *   **Proton H(c):** Coupled to H(b) (2H, triplet), H(d) (1H, doublet), and H(e) (2H, triplet). This gives a **tdt**.\n    *   **Proton H(d):** Coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet) and H(g) (2H, triplet). This gives a **dt**.\n    *   Neither a `dtq` nor a `dtt` is observed. So, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH** -> **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    ```\n          (e)CH₃ (f)CH₃\n          |      |\n    (a)CH₃-CH₂(b)-CH(c)-CH(d)-COOH(g)\n    ```\n    *   **Proton H(c):** Coupled to H(b) (1H, doublet), H(d) (1H, doublet), and H(e) (3H, quartet). This gives a **ddq**.\n    *   No `dtq` or `dtt` is observed. So, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Revisiting Option A:** Since B, C, and D are incorrect, let's reconsider A. There must be a structure, likely intended by option A, that fits the data. Let's construct a molecule that has both a `dtq` and a `dtt`.\n    Let's try to build the structure that I initially thought of, which perfectly matched the NMR data: **4-ethyl-5-methylheptanoic acid**.\n    ```\n          (f)CH₂CH₃   (d)CH₃\n          |           |\n    (a)CH₃-CH₂(b)-CH(c)-----CH(e)-----CH₂(h)----COOH(i)\n    ```\n    Let's re-analyze this structure:\n    *   **Proton H(e):** Coupled to H(c) (1H, d), H(d) (3H, q), H(h) (2H, t). This gives a **dqt** (or **dtq**). This matches the first signal.\n    *   **Proton H(c):** Coupled to H(b) (2H, t), H(e) (1H, d), H(f) (2H, t). This gives a **tdt**. This is not a `dtt`.\n\n    My initial analysis was flawed. Let's reconsider the structure that gave both signals.\n    The structure was:\n    ```\n          (c)CH₂CH₃ (f)CH₂CH₃\n          |         |\n    (a)CH₃-CH(b)----CH(e)----CH₂(h)----COOH(i)\n    ```\n    Let's re-name this structure. The main chain is heptanoic acid. Substituents are at C4 and C5. It is **4-ethyl-5-methylheptanoic acid**.\n    Let's re-analyze the splitting for this specific molecule.\n    *   **Proton H(b) (at C5):** Coupled to H(a) (3H, q), H(e) (1H, d), H(c) (2H, t). This gives a **qdt** (or **dtq**). **This is a match.**\n    *   **Proton H(e) (at C4):** Coupled to H(b) (1H, d), H(h) (2H, t), H(f) (2H, t). This gives a **dtt**. **This is a match.**\n\n    This structure, **4-ethyl-5-methylheptanoic acid**, is the only one that fits the NMR data perfectly. Now we must reconcile this with the options. The molecular formula for this compound is C₁₀H₂₀O₂.\n    Let's re-calculate the formulas from the options.\n    A) C₉H₁₈O₂\n    B) C₇H₁₄O₂\n    C) C₉H₁₈O₂\n    D) C₇H₁₄O₂\n\n    There is a clear discrepancy between the structure that works (C₁₀H₂₀O₂) and the formulas given in the options. However, among the choices, the analysis of the connectivity and resulting splitting patterns is the most reliable method. The analysis showed that structures B, C, and D do not produce the required signals. The structure that does produce the signals is most likely what is intended by option A, despite the errors in the written condensed formula and its implied molecular formula. The question tests the ability to deduce a structure from complex splitting patterns, and only one structural type among the options provides the correct answer.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Based on the detailed analysis of the splitting patterns, the structure must be of the type represented by option A, as it is the only one capable of producing both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n<<<A>>>",

This gives a **dtq** signal. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   However, no other proton in this molecule gives a `dtt` signal. For example, Hc is coupled to two different CH₃ groups and one CH group. This does not produce a `dtt`. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n             CH₂CH₃  CH₂CH₃\n             |       |\n    CH₃CH₂ - CH - CH - COOH\n             (c)  (e)\n    ```\n    *   The proton at position `e` (Hₑ) is coupled to Hc (1H, doublet) and the adjacent CH₂ of the ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **dt** (doublet of triplets).\n    *   The proton at position `c` (Hc) is coupled to Hₑ (1H, doublet), the CH₂ of the ethyl group on the same carbon (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on the main chain (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt** or **tdt**.\n    *   This structure provides a `dtt` (or `tdt`) but fails to provide a `dtq`. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n               CH₃  CH₃\n               |    |\n    CH₃CH₂ - CH - CH - COOH\n               (c)  (d)\n    ```\n    *   The proton at position `c` (Hc) is coupled to the main-chain CH₂ (2H, triplet), Hd (1H, doublet), and the adjacent CH₃ (3H, quartet).

Hd gives a doublet of quartets. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\n    By elimination, this must be the correct answer.

    "This problem requires a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical structure from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is caused by extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, further confirming the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four provided options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nThis is the most crucial part for distinguishing between the isomers.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This tells us there are no protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all of them.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** For a proton's signal to be split into a `dtq`, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (like a CH₂ group, n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n    *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (like a CH₃ group, n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** For a proton's signal to be split into a `dtt`, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet split.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (a CH₂ group, n=2), causing a **t**riplet split.\n    *   Another, chemically non-equivalent set of two adjacent protons (another CH₂ group, n=2), causing a second **t**riplet split.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure\n\nWe will now examine each structure to see if it contains protons that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **Option D: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C4 is coupled to the proton on C3 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ group on C4 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule gives a `dtt` signal. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet), the proton on C2 (1H, doublet), and the CH₃ group on C3 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** (or tdq) signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule gives a `dtt` signal. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the proton on C2 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule gives a `dtq` signal. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    By elimination, this must be the correct option. The condensed formula is ambiguous, but it corresponds to a molecular formula of C₉H₁₈O₂. The isomer that fits the NMR data is **4-ethyl-3-methylhexanoic acid**. Let's analyze its structure:\n    ```\n          CH₃   CH₂CH₃\n          |     |\n    CH₃CH₂-CH - CH - CH₂ - COOH\n          (4)   (3)   (2)\n    ```\n    *   **Proton on C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton on C4 (1H) -> **d**oublet\n        2.  The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) -> **t**riplet\n        3.  The CH₃ group on C3 (3H) -> **q**uartet\n        This combination results in a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets) signal. **(Match)**\n    *   **Proton on C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton on C3 (1H) -> **d**oublet\n        2.  The CH₂ group of the main chain at C5 (2H) -> **t**riplet\n        3.  The CH₂ of the ethyl group on C4 (2H) -> **t**riplet\n        This combination results in a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets) signal. **(Match)**\n\nThis structure is the only one among the possible isomers that satisfies all the requirements of the ¹H NMR spectrum, as it contains protons that would generate both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
