    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem involves uncertainty in position (Δx) and asks for the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). This points to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The relevant form connects position and momentum:\n    Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n    *   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π), approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n2.  **Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):**\n    We are given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n    To find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n    Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\n3.  **Relate uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to uncertainty in momentum (Δp):**\n    The energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p). We need to find how a change in momentum (Δp) affects the energy (ΔE). This can be found by taking the derivative of energy with respect to momentum, dE/dp.\n    The relationship between the uncertainties can be approximated as:\n    ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp\n\n    Let's find dE/dp. The kinetic energy (K) of a particle is given by K = E_total - E_rest. Since the rest energy (m₀c²) is constant, the uncertainty in total energy is the same as the uncertainty in kinetic energy (ΔE = ΔK).\n\n    *   **Non-relativistic case:** K = p² / (2m₀). Then dK/dp = 2p / (2m₀) = p/m₀ = v.\n    *   **Relativistic case:** The total energy is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)². Differentiating with respect to p gives 2E(dE/dp) = 2pc². So, dE/dp = pc²/E. Using the relativistic relations E = γm₀c² and p = γm₀v, we get dE/dp = (γm₀v * c²) / (γm₀c²) = v.\n\n    In both cases, the relationship is dE/dp = v. Therefore, we can write:\n    ΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\n4.  **Combine the equations and calculate ΔE:**\n    Substitute the expression for Δp from step 2 into the equation from step 3:\n    ΔE = v * [ħ / (2 * Δx)]\n\n    Now, plug in the given values:\n    *   v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Δx = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\n    Let's perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 2 * 10**8  # speed of electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1 * 10**-9  # uncertainty in position in meters (0.1 nm)\n\n# Constants\nhbar = 1.054571817 * 10**-34  # reduced Planck constant in J·s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n# delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (delta_E)\n# The relation is delta_E = v * delta_p\ndelta_E = v * delta_p\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"{delta_E:.4e} J\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n1.0546e-16 J\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.0546 x 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n    *   B) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n    *   C) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n    *   D) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe calculated value, ~1.05 x 10⁻¹⁶ J, is closest to 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and calculation to determine the minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy.\n\n**1. Identify the Core Principle**\n\nThe problem deals with uncertainty in position (Δx) and asks for the corresponding uncertainty in energy (ΔE). This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The relevant form connects position and momentum:\n\n*   **Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2**\n\nWhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n*   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π), which is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\nTo find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n*   **Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)**\n\n**2. Relate Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp) to Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE)**\n\nWe need to find how a small change in momentum (Δp) affects the energy (E). This relationship can be found by considering the derivative of energy with respect to momentum, dE/dp. The uncertainties are related by:\n\n*   **ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp**\n\nThe relationship between energy and momentum is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where m₀ is the rest mass. Differentiating this with respect to p gives:\n\n*   2E * (dE/dp) = 2pc²\n*   dE/dp = pc² / E\n\nUsing the standard relativistic definitions E = γm₀c² and p = γm₀v (where γ is the Lorentz factor), we can substitute them into the expression for dE/dp:\n\n*   dE/dp = (γm₀v * c²) / (γm₀c²) = v\n\nThis shows that the rate of change of energy with respect to momentum is simply the particle's velocity, v. Therefore, our relationship for the uncertainties becomes:\n\n*   **ΔE ≈ v * Δp**\n\n**3. Combine and Calculate**\n\nNow we can combine the two equations we've derived:\n\n1.  Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n2.  ΔE = v * Δp\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second gives a direct formula for ΔE:\n\n*   **ΔE = v * [ ħ / (2 * Δx) ]**\n\nLet's plug in the given values to calculate the result.\n\n*   v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n```python\n# Define the constants and given values\nv = 2 * 10**8  # speed in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1 * 10**-9  # uncertainty in position in meters\nhbar = 1.054571817 * 10**-34  # reduced Planck constant in J.s\n\n# Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n# delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (delta_E) using the relation delta_E = v * delta_p\ndelta_E = v * delta_p\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation to compare with the options\nprint(f\"{delta_E:.3e}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n1.055e-16\n</execute_code>\n**4.

The most relevant form for this problem connects position (x) and momentum (p):\n\n*   **Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2**\n\nThis principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) and the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp) must be greater than or equal to a constant value, ħ/2 (where ħ is the reduced Planck constant). To find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n\n*   **Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)**\n\n**2. Relate Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty**\n\nWe have the uncertainty in momentum (Δp), but the question asks for the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). We need to find the relationship between them. This can be found by considering how energy (E) changes with respect to momentum (p). This relationship is given by the derivative, dE/dp. For small uncertainties, we can approximate:\n\n*   **ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) ⋅ Δp**\n\nTo find dE/dp, we use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, since the electron's speed (v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s):\n\n*   E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to p, we get:\n\n*   2E (dE/dp) = 2pc²\n*   dE/dp = pc² / E\n\nUsing the relativistic definitions p = γm₀v and E = γm₀c², we find:\n\n*   dE/dp = (γm₀v ⋅ c²) / (γm₀c²) = **v**\n\nSo, the relationship simplifies beautifully to:\n\n*   **ΔE = v ⋅ Δp**\n\n**3.
