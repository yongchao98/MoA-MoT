    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a transition in a hydrogen atom (H-atom). The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n    The selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n = n_{final} - n_{initial}$ can be any integer, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$, which violates the selection rule. Therefore, the transition must proceed through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **First Transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$\n        *   Applying the selection rule for $l$: $\\Delta l = l_i - l_{initial} = l_i - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since the orbital quantum number $l_i$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_i = 1$.\n        *   Applying the selection rule for $m$: $\\Delta m = m_i - m_{initial} = m_i - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m_i$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   For the principal quantum number $n$, the energy must decrease, so $n_i < 3$. The most likely transitions are to the closest energy level, so we consider $n_i=2$. (A transition to $n_i=1$ would require $l_i=1$, but the only state with $n=1$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$, so this is not possible).\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Let's check if a transition from our possible intermediate states to the final state is allowed. The intermediate states are of the form $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ and the final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the selection rule for $l$: $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   Applying the selection rule for $m$: $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_i = 0 - m_i$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. Since our possible $m_i$ values are $-1, 0, 1$, this condition is satisfied for all three possible intermediate states.\n        *   So, all three cascade routes are permitted by the selection rules:\n            *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n            *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n            *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This probability is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability that the atom, starting in $|3,0,0\\rangle$, will decay into a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$. Once the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ states, it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with probability 1, as this is the only allowed E1 decay path to a lower energy level.\n\n    The transition rate $\\Gamma$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle n_f, l_f, m_f | \\mathbf{r} | n_i, l_i, m_i \\rangle|^2$.\n    The probability (branching ratio) for decaying to a specific state $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ is:\n    $P(m_i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_i\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m'=-1}^{1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}$\n\n    A key physical principle simplifies this calculation: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. Due to this rotational invariance, the decay process cannot favor one final orientation ($m_i$) over another. Therefore, the probabilities of transitioning to the three magnetic substates $m_i = -1, 0, 1$ must be equal.\n\n    So, we have:\n    $P(m_i=-1) = P(m_i=0) = P(m_i=1)$\n\n    Since these are the only possible outcomes for the first decay step, their probabilities must sum to 1:\n    $P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1$\n\n    This implies:\n    $3 \\times P(m_i) = 1 \\implies P(m_i) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each of the three routes.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$.

This matches our calculation.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be $\\frac{1}{3}$).\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A non-relativistic Hydrogen atom (H-atom).\n    *   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 3s state.\n    *   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 1s ground state.\n    *   **Process:** The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means it's a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the correct decay path (the intermediate state) and the probability of that specific path.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    For an atom to transition from an initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$ to a final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle$ by emitting a single photon (E1 transition), the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For emission (decay), the energy must decrease, which means the principal quantum number must decrease, $n_f < n_i$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Possible Intermediate States:**\n    The decay happens in two steps:\n    *   **Step 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$ (Intermediate State)\n    *   **Step 2:** $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ (Final State)\n\n    Let's apply the selection rules to Step 1:\n    *   Initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n    *   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l' = 1$.\n    *   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Rule for n:** We need $n' < n_i=3$. Also, for any state, we must have $l' \\le n'-1$. Since we found $l'=1$, we need $1 \\le n'-1$, which implies $n' \\ge 2$. Combining $n'<3$ and $n'\\ge2$, the only possible value is $n'=2$.\n\n    So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    Now, let's check if Step 2 is allowed from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state for Step 2 is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. Since $m'$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$, this condition is satisfied for all three possible intermediate states.\n    *   **Rule for n:** $\\Delta n = n_f - n' = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\n    Conclusion: All three decay paths are possible:\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first decay step. The total transition rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible intermediate states. The probability of one specific channel is the rate of that channel divided by the total rate.\n\n    $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1}^{1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\n\n    We can determine the relative probabilities using a powerful symmetry argument:\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A non-relativistic Hydrogen atom (H-atom).\n    *   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 3s state.\n    *   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 1s ground state.\n    *   **Process:** The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means it's a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the correct decay path (the intermediate state) and the probability of that specific path.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    For an atom to transition from an initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$ to a final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle$ by emitting a single photon (E1 transition), the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For emission (decay), the energy must decrease, which means the principal quantum number must decrease, $n_f < n_i$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Possible Intermediate States:**\n    The decay happens in two steps:\n    *   **Step 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$ (Intermediate State)\n    *   **Step 2:** $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ (Final State)\n\n    Let's apply the selection rules to Step 1:\n    *   Initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n    *   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l' = 1$.\n    *   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Rule for n:** We need $n' < n_i=3$. Also, for any state, we must have $l' \\le n'-1$. Since we found $l'=1$, we need $1 \\le n'-1$, which implies $n' \\ge 2$. Combining $n'<3$ and $n'\\ge2$, the only possible value is $n'=2$.\n\n    So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    Now, let's check if Step 2 is allowed from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state for Step 2 is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. Since $m'$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$, this condition is satisfied for all three possible intermediate states.\n    *   **Rule for n:** $\\Delta n = n_f - n' = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\n    Conclusion: All three decay paths are possible:\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first decay step. The total transition rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible intermediate states. The probability of one specific channel is the rate of that channel divided by the total rate.\n\n    $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1}^{1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\n\n    We can determine the relative probabilities using a powerful symmetry argument:\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. Its wave function is spherically symmetric, meaning it has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Because the initial state is rotationally invariant, the decay process itself cannot have a preferred direction.\n    *   Therefore, the atom must decay with equal probability into each of the available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate p-state ($l'=1$).\n\n    This means:\n    $P(\\text{to } m'=-1) = P(\\text{to } m'=0) = P(\\text{to } m'=+1)$\n\n    Since these are the only three possible outcomes for the first transition, their probabilities must sum to 1:\n    $P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1$\n    $3 \\times P(\\text{any single } m') = 1$\n    $P(\\text{any single } m') = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n    So, the probability of the decay proceeding through the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state is $\\frac{1}{3}$. The probability of it proceeding through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is also $\\frac{1}{3}$, and similarly for $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{2}{3}$.
