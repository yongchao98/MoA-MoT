    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\n**1. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data Analysis:**\n*   The broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   The strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n*   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹** are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can infer that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data Analysis:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield shift to 8.0 ppm is caused by the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an alkyl substituent.\n*   **Alkyl Region Signals:** The remaining signals describe the structure of the alkyl group attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** This is likely a methine (-CH) proton directly attached to the benzene ring. Its chemical shift is downfield due to the deshielding effect of the aromatic ring.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** This indicates a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n    *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** This suggests a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n\n**3. Assembling the Structure of the Alkyl Group:**\nThe signals at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) and 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) are characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The signals at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) suggest a CH-CH₃ fragment where the CH is also bonded to the ethyl group and the benzene ring. This combination forms a *sec*-butyl group: `CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)-`.\n\nTherefore, the structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI\n\nThe reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and hydriodic acid (HI) is a strong reduction reaction. This combination of reagents is known to reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction involves the removal of both oxygen atoms from the carboxyl group and their replacement with hydrogen atoms. The red phosphorus helps to regenerate HI from the iodine (I₂) formed during the reaction, thus allowing the reduction to go to completion.\n\nApplying this to our starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the -COOH group will be reduced to a -CH₃ group, while the *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material)\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n\nThe final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
