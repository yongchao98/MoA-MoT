    "In the described experiment, yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* forms a shmoo upon treatment with a peptide. Shmoo formation is a characteristic response to mating pheromones, during which the cell arrests its cycle in the G1 phase to prepare for mating. The experiment aims to analyze the proteome of *active chromatin* using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by Mass Spectrometry (ChIP-MS). Active chromatin consists of genomic regions where genes are being actively transcribed.\n\nLet's evaluate the likelihood of observing each complex in this assay:\n\n*   **A) Enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers (or upstream activating sequences in yeast) bind transcription factors that are essential for recruiting the transcriptional machinery and activating gene expression. Since the formation of a shmoo requires the active transcription of specific mating-related genes, these complexes would be abundant in the active chromatin and thus highly likely to be recovered.\n*   **B) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** The PIC, which includes RNA Polymerase II and general transcription factors, assembles at the promoters of genes to initiate transcription. As active transcription is occurring, the PIC would be a core component of the active chromatin being studied. Therefore, it would be expected to be found in high quantities.\n*   **C) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the fundamental structural units of all chromatin, composed of histone proteins. Active chromatin is characterized by specific post-translational modifications on these histones (e.g., acetylation) that create a more open and accessible structure for transcription. An assay targeting active chromatin would inherently recover these modified nucleosomes. As histones are ubiquitous components of chromatin, they would definitely be observed.\n*   **D) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** The pre-RC is composed of proteins like the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6, and the MCM helicase, which assembles at origins of replication during the G1 phase. Its function is to license the DNA for replication in the upcoming S phase. However, the pheromone-induced shmoo response causes a strong cell cycle **arrest** in G1, actively preventing the transition into S phase and the initiation of DNA replication. While the pre-RC is assembled on chromatin during G1, its function is related to DNA replication, not transcription. Given that the cell is halting progression towards replication and the assay is targeting regions of *active transcription*, the pre-replication complex would be the least associated with the specific chromatin regions being recovered.\n\nTherefore, the proteins of the pre-replication complex will be the least observed in an assay for the proteome of active chromatin during shmoo formation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
