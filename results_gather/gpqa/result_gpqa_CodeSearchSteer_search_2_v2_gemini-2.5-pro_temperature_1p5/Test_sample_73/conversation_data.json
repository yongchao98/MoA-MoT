    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the principle of radioactive decay:** Radioactive decay is an exponential process. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its inherent probability of decaying in any future period.\n\n2.  **Determine the decay constant (λ):** The probability of decay is governed by the decay constant, λ. The relationship between the number of atoms at time `t`, N(t), and the initial number of atoms, N(0), is given by the formula: `N(t) = N(0) * e^(-λt)`.\n\n    The probability that an atom *survives* up to time `t` is `P(survival) = N(t) / N(0) = e^(-λt)`.\n    Therefore, the probability that it *decays* within time `t` is `P(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find λ:\n    `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is simply the probability of a fresh atom decaying in a 150-minute interval.\n\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n    To solve this, we can manipulate the expression we found in the previous step:\n    From `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`, we can write `(e^(-λ))^100 = 0.68`, which means `e^(-λ) = (0.68)^(1/100)`.\n\n    Now substitute this into the formula for the 150-minute decay probability:\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (e^(-λ))^150`\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - ((0.68)^(1/100))^150`\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^(150/100)`\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n4.  **Perform the final calculation:**\n    `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
