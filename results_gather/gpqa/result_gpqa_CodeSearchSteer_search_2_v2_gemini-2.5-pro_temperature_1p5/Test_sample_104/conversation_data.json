    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal amplitude as the described starspots, we can follow a two-step calculation. First, we determine the photometric variation caused by the starspots. Second, we calculate the size an exoplanet would need to be to cause an equivalent drop in brightness during a transit.\n\n### 1. Calculating the Starspot-Induced Brightness Variation\n\nThe brightness of a star is proportional to the integral of its emitted flux over the visible disk. The flux itself is related to the fourth power of the effective temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ T⁴).\n\nThe star has two distinct hemispheres:\n*   **Unspotted Hemisphere:** This hemisphere has a uniform temperature of T_star = 6000 K. When this side faces the observer, the star is at its maximum brightness.\n*   **Spotted Hemisphere:** This hemisphere has a base temperature of 6000 K, but 20% of its area (the filling factor, f_spot = 0.20) is covered by dark spots with a cooler temperature of T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K. When this side faces the observer, the star is at its minimum brightness.\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux:\n\n**Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)**\n\nThe flux from the spotted hemisphere (F_min) is a weighted average of the flux from the hot photosphere and the cooler spots. We can express the ratio F_min / F_max as:\n\nF_min / F_max = (1 - f_spot) * (T_star/T_star)⁴ + f_spot * (T_spot/T_star)⁴\nF_min / F_max = (1 - 0.20) + 0.20 * (5000 / 6000)⁴\nF_min / F_max = 0.80 + 0.20 * (5/6)⁴\nF_min / F_max = 0.80 + 0.20 * (625 / 1296)\nF_min / F_max ≈ 0.80 + 0.20 * 0.48225\nF_min / F_max ≈ 0.80 + 0.09645 = 0.89645\n\nNow, we can find the amplitude of the signal:\n\nAmplitude = 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355\n\nSo, the total brightness of the star varies by about 10.36% due to the rotation and the uneven spot distribution.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Equivalent Exoplanet Radius\n\nAn exoplanet transiting its star blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in the observed brightness. The depth of this transit, assuming a simplified central transit and ignoring effects like limb darkening, is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n\n**Transit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²**\n\nTo produce the same amplitude signal as the starspots, the transit depth must be equal to the calculated amplitude:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n\nTo find the relative radius (R_pl / R_star), we take the square root of the amplitude:\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355 ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.39\n\nThe calculated relative radius of ~0.32 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
