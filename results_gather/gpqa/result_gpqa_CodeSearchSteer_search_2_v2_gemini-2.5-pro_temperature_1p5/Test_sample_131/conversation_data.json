    "To solve this, we must determine the expected 1H NMR signals for each potential compound and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the spectral data provided.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided NMR Data\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows two singlets at ~6.7 ppm with a 1:1 integral ratio. This means the mixture contains two different types of aromatic protons, and they are present in equal amounts. A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent proton neighbors.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum displays three singlets at ~2.2 ppm with a 2:1:1 integral ratio. These signals correspond to the methyl (–CH₃) groups on the benzene rings. Singlets here indicate the methyl groups are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Each Compound\n\nLet's analyze the expected spectrum for each of the four compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since they have no adjacent protons, this signal will be a **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. This will result in a **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent proton neighbors. This results in **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent to each other. The methyl group at position 2 is unique, and the methyl group at position 5 is unique. This leads to **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets** with a 6H:6H or **1:1** integration ratio.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry, producing **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each ethyl group consists of a methylene (–CH₂–) and a methyl (–CH₃) group. These would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. This compound can be eliminated immediately based on the alkyl region data.\n\n### Evaluating the Mixtures\n\nNow, let's determine which 1:1 mixture corresponds to the observed spectrum.\n\n*   The data shows **three alkyl singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**. Looking at our individual analyses, only **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** produces this exact pattern on its own.\n*   The data also shows **two aromatic singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene by itself has two aromatic singlets, but their integrals would be 1H each.\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one aromatic singlet with an integral of 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has one aromatic singlet with an integral of 2H.\n\nLet's test the option containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene alongside another compound that could fit the remaining data.\n\n**Consider the mixture in Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (representing 6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (representing 12H).\n    *   The combined spectrum would show four signals, which contradicts the data.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction. Let's re-read the prompt carefully. *\"...three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\"* This ratio describes the signals for the **entire mixture**. Let's reconsider how the signals combine in a 1:1 mixture. The total number of protons for each compound is 14.\n\n**Re-evaluating Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\n*   **Component 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H). Alkyl: 1 singlet (12H).\n*   **Component 2 (1,2,3,4-TMB):** Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H). Alkyl: 2 singlets (6H each).\n\nLet's combine them in a 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives another 2H singlet. If these have different chemical shifts, we will see **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. This gives an **integral ratio of 1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n*   **Alkyl Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. This creates a total of **three singlets** with integrals in the ratio **12H : 6H : 6H**. This simplifies to a **2:1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
