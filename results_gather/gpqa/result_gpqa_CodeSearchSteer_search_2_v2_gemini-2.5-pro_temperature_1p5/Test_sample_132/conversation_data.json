    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, the following steps are taken:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each component:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n    *   The initial concentration of the dihydrogen phosphate ion, [H₂PO₄⁻], is from KH₂PO₄:\n        [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   The initial concentration of the monohydrogen phosphate ion, [HPO₄²⁻], is from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:\n        [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the pH of the buffer solution:**\n    *   The solution is a buffer made of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), governed by Kₐ₂.\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Kₐ₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸)\n    *   The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n    *   pKₐ₂ = -log(Kₐ₂) = -log(6.2x10⁻⁸) ≈ 7.21\n    *   pH = pKₐ₂ + log([HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻])\n    *   pH = 7.21 + log(0.02809 / 0.03674)\n    *   pH = 7.21 + log(0.7646) ≈ 7.21 - 0.117 = 7.093\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻⁷.¹⁰⁹³ ≈ 8.07x10⁻⁸ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the monohydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This equilibrium is governed by Kₐ₃.\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (Kₐ₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²)\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Kₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]: [PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹² * 0.02809) / 8.07x10⁻⁸\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.26x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
