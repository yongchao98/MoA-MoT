    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2.\n\n**1. Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n\n**2. Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))\nT_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))\n\nThe ratio is:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nSince the star is the same for both planets (T_star and R_star are constant) and the problem states they have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂), the terms for temperature, albedo, and stellar radius cancel out.\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(1 / a₁) / sqrt(1 / a₂)\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes, a₂/a₁.\n\n**3. Using Radial Velocity Data to Find the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the \"wobble\" of the star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The amplitude of the stellar radial velocity (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere:\n*   M_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n(This assumes the orbital inclination is close to 90°, which is a valid assumption since the planets were also detected via the transit method).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\n\nsqrt(a) ≈ (M_p / K) * sqrt(G / M_star)\na ≈ (M_p / K)² * (G / M_star)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [(M_p2 / K₂)² * (G / M_star)] / [(M_p1 / K₁)² * (G / M_star)]\n\nThe terms (G / M_star) cancel out, leaving:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / K₂)² / (M_p1 / K₁)²\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\nThe Doppler shift in wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity amplitude (K), so the ratio K₁ / K₂ is the same as the ratio Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, calculate the mass and RV amplitude ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n*   a₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n*   a₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n*   a₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, use this ratio to find the equilibrium temperature ratio:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
