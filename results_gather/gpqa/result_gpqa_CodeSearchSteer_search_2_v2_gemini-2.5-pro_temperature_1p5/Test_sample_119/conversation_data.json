    "Based on the assumption of a uniform spatial distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit parallax range varies inversely with the fourth power of the parallax.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** We begin with the assumption that stars are distributed uniformly throughout space. This means the number of stars per unit volume, known as the number density (ρ), is constant.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Shell:** Consider a thin spherical shell of space with a radius `d` from Earth and a small thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume: `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`. Since 4, π, and ρ are constants, the number of stars is directly proportional to `d² dd`.\n\n3.  **Relating Distance to Parallax:** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. For simplicity, using the standard units of arcseconds for parallax and parsecs for distance, this relationship is `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Connecting Distance and Parallax Ranges:** We need to relate the thickness of the shell (`dd`) to the corresponding range in parallax (`d(plx)`). We can find this by differentiating the distance-parallax equation:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n    *   `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   When considering the number of stars in a given range, we are interested in the magnitude, so `dd` is proportional to `(1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` back into our equation for the number of stars `dN`:\n    *   `dN ∝ d² dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN ∝ (1/plx)² dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd ∝ (1/plx²) d(plx)`: `dN ∝ (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   This simplifies to: `dN ∝ (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\nThe question asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the term `dN/d(plx)`, changes with parallax (`plx`). Based on the final proportionality, we can see that:\n\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis result is also confirmed in astronomical literature, which states that for a uniform distribution of stars in space, the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to `1/π⁴`, where π is the parallax.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<B>>>"
