    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two different energy levels changes, we need to use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower state (level 1) is given by:\n\n```\nn₂ / n₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n```\n\nWhere:\n-   `n₂` and `n₁` are the number densities of atoms in level 2 and level 1.\n-   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels. This ratio `(g₂/g₁)` is constant for the given transition.\n-   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels.\n-   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K).\n-   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the energy difference `ΔE` corresponding to the transition wavelength λ = 1448 Å (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m).\n\nThe energy of a photon is given by:\n\n```\nΔE = h * c / λ\n```\n\nWhere:\n-   `h` is the Planck constant (approximately 4.136 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s).\n-   `c` is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\n-   `λ` is the wavelength (1448 Å = 1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m).\n\n```\nΔE = (4.136 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s * 3 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 8.57 eV\n```\n\nNow, we can define the ratio of populations for the two different temperatures:\n\n1.  **Without spots (T₁ = 6000 K):**\n    `Ratio₁ = (n₂/n₁)₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))`\n\n2.  **With spots (T₂ = 5500 K):**\n    `Ratio₂ = (n₂/n₁)₂ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\nWe want to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. This is the ratio of `Ratio₁` to `Ratio₂`:\n\n```\nFactor = Ratio₁ / Ratio₂ = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n```\n\nThe term `(g₂/g₁)` cancels out:\n\n```\nFactor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ]\n```\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\n-   `ΔE` ≈ 8.57 eV\n-   `k` ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n-   `T₁` = 6000 K\n-   `T₂` = 5500 K\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of `ΔE / k`:\n\n```\nΔE / k ≈ 8.57 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99454 K\n```\n\nNow, substitute this into the equation for the factor:\n\n```\nFactor = exp[ -99454 * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]\nFactor = exp[ -99454 * ( (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) ) ]\nFactor = exp[ -99454 * (-500 / 33,000,000) ]\nFactor = exp[ -99454 * (-1.515 x 10⁻⁵) ]\nFactor = exp(1.506)\nFactor ≈ 4.508\n```\n\nThus, the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is approximately 4.5 times larger when the star has no spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it is 40% covered by spots (T=5500 K). This matches the observation that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\n\n<<<A>>>"
