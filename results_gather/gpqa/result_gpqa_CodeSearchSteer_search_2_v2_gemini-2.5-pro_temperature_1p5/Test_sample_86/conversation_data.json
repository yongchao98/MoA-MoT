    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Decoding the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents. This ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Total of 8 carbon atoms:** Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Carbonyl group:** One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen (-F, -Cl, -Br, or -I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nBased on these facts, the two substituents are a halogen (-X) and a two-carbon chain containing a carbonyl group. The most plausible structure for the second substituent is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This leads to a haloacetophenone molecule. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Potential 1H NMR Spectra\n\nThe two substituents, a halogen and an acetyl group, can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions on the benzene ring. Let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each, focusing on the `para`-isomer (1,4-dihaloacetophenone), as it often results in a simpler, more recognizable spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** `para`-haloacetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃).\n*   **Aromatic Protons (-C₆H₄-):** Due to the symmetry of a para-substituted ring, the four aromatic protons are divided into two equivalent sets. This typically results in two signals, each appearing as a doublet, and each integrating to 2H. These signals are found in the aromatic region, generally between 6.5-8.0 ppm.\n*   **Methyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The methyl group is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these three protons will appear as a singlet (a single unsplit peak). The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around 2.0-2.5 ppm.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's compare our prediction with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. This option does not match our predicted structure.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have four). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`:** This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the classic signature of a para-substituted benzene ring. The signals are in the correct aromatic region.\n    *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`:** This is a singlet representing three protons at a chemical shift characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for `para`-haloacetophenone. For example, the reported spectrum of 4'-Chloroacetophenone shows doublets around 7.89 and 7.43 ppm, and a singlet for the methyl group at 2.59 ppm, which is very close to the values in this option.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region (6.5-8.5 ppm) and is therefore incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data in option C is the only one that correctly represents a di-substituted, 8-carbon aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and a halogen. The structure is specifically a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
