    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a norbornadiene derivative. It reacts with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene in the presence of sodium iodide at an elevated temperature. The second reagent, while having a complex name, is a precursor that, upon reaction with sodium iodide, generates a highly reactive diene known as *o*-xylylene (also called *o*-quinodimethane or 5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene) *in situ*.\n\nSince two equivalents of the *o*-xylylene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs. Each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene system acts as a dienophile and reacts with one molecule of *o*-xylylene. This results in the formation of product 1, a large, polycyclic cage-like molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. The tert-butoxy group (-O-tBu) is an ether that is readily cleaved under acidic conditions. The acid catalyzes the hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ether to a secondary alcohol (-OH), forming product 2.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 is treated with a sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex (SO₃•py) in DMSO. This combination of reagents is known as the Parikh-Doering oxidation. This procedure oxidizes primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively, under mild conditions. The secondary alcohol at the C7 position of the bicyclic core in product 2 is oxidized to a ketone, yielding product 3.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\nProduct 3, a complex polycyclic ketone, is heated to 150°C. Such cage-like structures, which are adducts from Diels-Alder reactions, often undergo a reverse reaction, known as a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, upon heating. In this case, product 3 fragments, releasing the two *o*-xylylene molecules and regenerating the dienophile component, which is now bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one.\n\nThis intermediate, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one, is known to be unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, releasing a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic compound, benzene.\n\nThus, the overall products of heating product 3 are benzene, carbon monoxide, and two molecules of *o*-xylylene. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product 4. Since benzene has only one type of hydrogen (which is not among the options), it is most likely that \"product 4\" refers to the other major organic product, *o*-xylylene.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (*o*-xylylene)**\nThe structure of *o*-xylylene is 5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. This molecule possesses C₂ᵥ symmetry. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we analyze their equivalence based on the molecule's symmetry elements.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This symmetry makes the following pairs of protons equivalent:\n1.  The proton on C1 and the proton on C4.\n2.  The proton on C2 and the proton on C3.\n\nFurthermore, the two exocyclic methylene (=CH₂) groups are equivalent. However, within a single methylene group, the two protons are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic). Let's refer to the protons on the methylene groups as \"inner\" (closer to the other methylene group) and \"outer.\" Due to the plane of symmetry:\n3.  The two \"inner\" hydrogens (one on each methylene group) are equivalent to each other.\n4.  The two \"outer\" hydrogens (one on each methylene group) are equivalent to each other.\n\nTherefore, there are four sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms in *o*-xylylene.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe final product, 4 (*o*-xylylene), has 4 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nA) 7\nB) 10\nC) 4\nD) 8\n\nThe correct answer is 4.\n<<<C>>>"
