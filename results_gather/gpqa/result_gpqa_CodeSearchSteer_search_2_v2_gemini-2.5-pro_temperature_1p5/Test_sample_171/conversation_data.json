    "The correct relationship between the temperatures of the two stars is derived from the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy states in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (`N_excited`) to the number of atoms in the ground state (`N_ground`) is given by:\n\n    `N_excited / N_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / kT)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.3806 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n    *   `g` is the statistical weight or degeneracy of the energy level.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Two Stars**: We can write this equation for each star. Let `C` represent the constant ratio of statistical weights `(g_excited / g_ground)`.\n\n    *   For Star 1 (temperature T₁): `(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = C * exp(-ΔE / kT₁)`\n    *   For Star 2 (temperature T₂): `(N_excited / N_ground)₂ = C * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)`\n\n3.  **Using the Problem's Condition**: The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the population ratio in star_1 is double that in star_2:\n\n    `(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = 2 * (N_excited / N_ground)₂`\n\n4.  **Combining the Equations**: Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the condition:\n\n    `C * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * [C * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]`\n\n    The constant `C` cancels out:\n\n    `exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: To solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / kT₁)] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]`\n\n    Using the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n\n    `-ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2) - ΔE / kT₂`\n\n    Rearranging the terms to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / kT₂) - (ΔE / kT₁)`\n\n6.  **Simplifying the Expression**: Factor out the common term `ΔE/k`:\n\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1/T₂) - (1/T₁) ]`\n\n    Find a common denominator for the terms in the bracket:\n\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\n7.  **Substituting the Given Values**: The problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is also approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. This specific choice of value for `ΔE` is intended to simplify the equation, making the ratio `ΔE / k` approximately equal to 1 K.\n\n    Substituting `ΔE / k ≈ 1` into the equation gives:\n\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\n    This simplifies to the final correct relationship:\n\n    `ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\nThis result matches option D. It also makes physical sense: for ln(2) to be positive, T₁ must be greater than T₂, which is consistent with the higher excitation level observed in star_1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
