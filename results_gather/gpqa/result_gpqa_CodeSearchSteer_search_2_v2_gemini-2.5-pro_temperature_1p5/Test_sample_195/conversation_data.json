    "The problem of determining the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator can be solved by applying the principle of conservation of energy in the context of special relativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Define the Total Energy:** The total energy ($E$) of the system is the sum of the particle's total relativistic energy and the potential energy of the spring. The particle's total energy is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, which includes its rest energy ($mc^2$) and its kinetic energy ($(\\gamma - 1)mc^2$). The potential energy of the spring is $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. Thus, the total conserved energy of the system is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude:** At the point of maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the mass momentarily comes to a stop. Therefore, its velocity $v = 0$. When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = 1$. The total energy at this position is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n3.  **Energy at Maximum Speed:** The maximum speed ($v_{max}$) occurs when the mass passes through the equilibrium position, $x = 0$. At this point, the potential energy $V(0) = 0$. The Lorentz factor is at its maximum, corresponding to the maximum speed: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$. The total energy at this position is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:** Since the total energy of the system is conserved, we can equate the total energy at the point of maximum amplitude with the total energy at the point of maximum speed:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:**\n    First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, substitute the definition of the Lorentz factor:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to isolate $v_{max}$. Square both sides:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
