    "This is a classic problem in special relativity. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### 1. Identify the Given Information:\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The supernova ejecta and the center of the Galaxy are moving towards each other at 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving reference frame (the ejecta) is 50 seconds.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** The exact value is 299,792.458 km/s. For many calculations, this is rounded to 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 2. Understand the Physics\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for a moving object passes slower than for a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation. To find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame, we first need to determine how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n### 3. The Formulas\nThe relationship between time in the stationary frame (Δt) and the proper time in the moving frame (Δt₀) is given by the time dilation formula:\n**Δt = γ * Δt₀**\n\nWhere **γ** (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n**γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)**\n\nOnce we find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt), the distance (d) traveled is calculated using the standard distance formula:\n**d = v * Δt**\n\n### 4. Calculation Steps\nLet's perform the calculation using the precise value for the speed of light (c = 299,792.458 km/s).\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**\n    *   v = 60,000 km/s\n    *   c = 299,792.458 km/s\n    *   (v/c)² = (60,000 / 299,792.458)² ≈ 0.0400554\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.0400554)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(0.9599446)\n    *   γ ≈ 1.02065\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame**\n    *   Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    *   Δt ≈ 1.02065 * 50 s\n    *   Δt ≈ 51.0325 s\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame**\n    *   d = v * Δt\n    *   d = 60,000 km/s * 51.0325 s\n    *   d ≈ 3,061,950 km\n\nThis result is extremely close to the value in option B. The minor discrepancy often arises because problems of this nature in textbooks or exams are designed with a rounded speed of light or a simplified Lorentz factor for easier calculation. For example, if we assume the time elapsed in the galaxy frame is exactly 51 seconds:\n*   d = 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km.\n\nThis matches option B exactly. This implies the intended Lorentz factor for the problem simplifies to γ = 51/50 = 1.02.\n\nBased on the calculations, the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame is approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>"
