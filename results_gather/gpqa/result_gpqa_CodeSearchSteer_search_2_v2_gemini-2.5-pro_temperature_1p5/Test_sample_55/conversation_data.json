    "My initial reasoning appears correct and is confirmed by the search results.\n\n1.  **Selection Rules**: The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are consistently stated as Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.\n\n2.  **Decay Path**:\n    *   The initial state is |3,0,0>. For the first transition, since l=0, the selection rule Δl = ±1 requires that the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n    *   The problem specifies a two-step decay via the n=2 level. Therefore, the intermediate states must be of the form |2,1,m'>.\n    *   The selection rule Δm = 0, ±1 allows the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state, m', to be 0, +1, or -1.\n    *   For the second transition from the intermediate state |2,1,m'> to the final state |1,0,0>, the rules are also satisfied: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 and Δm = 0 - m' (which is 0, -1, or +1 for m' = 0, 1, -1 respectively).\n    *   Therefore, all three routes, via |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>, are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n3.  **Probability/Branching Ratio**:\n    *   The key is to determine the probability of entering each of these three allowed channels from the initial |3,0,0> state.\n    *   The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the first photon.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment matrix element, `<n',l',m'| **r** |n,l,m>`.\n    *   As confirmed by a source discussing this exact problem, applying the Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that the magnitude of the matrix element for the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m'> is independent of m'. Specifically, the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficients `<l=0, m=0; 1, q | l'=1, m'>` are all equal to 1 for the allowed transitions (where q=m').\n    *   Since the transition rates to the m'=-1, m'=0, and m'=+1 sublevels are equal, and these are the only possibilities for the first step of the decay cascade to n=2, they must be equally probable.\n    *   Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'> states (the 2p level), it can only decay to the |1,0,0> ground state via a single photon emission. Thus, the probability of the second step in the cascade is 1.\n    *   Therefore, the overall probability for any one of the specific three decay routes is determined entirely by the branching ratio of the first step, which is 1/3.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The decay route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> has a probability of 1/3. This matches option A. The other options list incorrect probabilities.\n\nFinal Check:\n*   Route A: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> -> Probability = 1/3. Correct.\n*   Route B: Missing initial state but probability of 2/3 is incorrect.\n*   Route C: |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> -> Probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n*   Route D: |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> -> Probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only correct choice.\n\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state cannot happen via a single dipole transition because this would violate the selection rule for the orbital angular momentum quantum number, l (Δl = 0, but the rule is Δl = ±1). The decay must therefore proceed via an intermediate state in a two-step cascade.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Δl = ±1\n*   Δm = 0, ±1\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state |n',l',m'⟩**\n\nThe problem specifies that the decay route involves an intermediate state with principal quantum number n=2.\n*   Initial state: |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0)\n*   Applying Δl = ±1: Since l=0, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n*   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: The magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state, m', can be -1, 0, or +1.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state |2,l',m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩**\n\nLet's check if transitions from the possible intermediate states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ are allowed:\n*   Intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ (n'=2, l'=1)\n*   Final state: |1,0,0⟩ (n''=1, l''=0, m''=0)\n*   Check Δl: l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies Δl = ±1.\n*   Check Δm: m'' - m' = 0 - m'. This can be 0, -1, or +1 depending on whether m' is 0, 1, or -1. This satisfies Δm = 0, ±1.\n\nTherefore, all three pathways are allowed by the selection rules:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the probability**\n\nThe probability of a specific decay route depends on the branching ratio of the first transition. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. In the absence of an external field, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probabilities of transitioning to each of the three possible m' sub-levels (m' = -1, 0, +1) are equal.\n\nSince there are three equally likely channels for the first step of the decay, the probability for any single channel is 1/3.\n\nThe second step of the decay, from any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states to the |1,0,0⟩ state, is the only possible radiative decay from the 2p level. Therefore, the probability of this transition, given that the atom is in the |2,1,m'⟩ state, is 1.\n\nThe total probability for a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route via the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩:\nP = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3. This matches our calculation.\n*   B) ...→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\n<<<A>>>"
