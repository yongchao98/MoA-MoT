    "The reaction between an enol and a halogen such as bromine is known as alpha-halogenation. The reactant, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is the enol tautomer of 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\nThe general mechanism for this reaction, which is often acid-catalyzed, involves the following steps:\n1.  The enol form is present in an equilibrium with its more stable keto form (ketone).\n2.  The double bond of the enol is electron-rich and acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic bromine (Br₂). This attack occurs at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group, which becomes the carbonyl carbon).\n3.  This step forms a new carbon-bromine bond at the alpha-position and an oxonium ion intermediate.\n4.  A weak base (like a bromide ion or solvent) deprotonates the hydroxyl group to regenerate the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\nFollowing this mechanism:\n*   The bromine atom will add to the alpha-carbon of the original enol, which is the C2 position.\n*   The enol's hydroxyl group (-OH) and the double bond will convert into a carbonyl group (a ketone).\n*   The two methyl groups on the C4 position remain unchanged.\n\nThe resulting major product is therefore 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. The other options are incorrect:\n*   A) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: Bromination does not occur at the C4 position, which is already saturated and not an alpha-carbon.\n*   B) and D) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol and (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: These products would result from the addition of Br₂ across the double bond without the subsequent and favored rearrangement to the more stable ketone. The formation of the carbonyl C=O bond is a strong thermodynamic driving force.\n\n<<<C>>>"
