    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. To determine the number of possible organic products, we must consider all potential reaction pathways.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide ion (NH2⁻) from NaNH2, abstracts a proton from a carbon atom ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6**, which holds a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2**, which holds a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, meaning the abstraction of the hydrogen is kinetically favored. This phenomenon is known as the kinetic isotope effect. However, both abstractions are possible and lead to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C-6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 creates a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom remains at C-2. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C-2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 results in a benzyne with the triple bond between C-1 and C-2. In this process, the deuterium is removed, so the intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe newly formed benzyne intermediates are highly reactive and will be attacked by a nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2⁻) in this case.\n\n*   **Addition to 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n    *   Attack at C-1 leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C-6 leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    Therefore, Pathway A yields two distinct deuterated products.\n\n*   **Addition to Benzyne (from Pathway B):** The amide ion attacks the symmetrical benzyne intermediate. Attack at either C-1 or C-2 yields the same product after protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n    *   This pathway leads to the formation of **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    Therefore, Pathway B yields one non-deuterated product.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we find a total of three different organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  2-Deuteroaniline\n2.  3-Deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nThus, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
