    "When solving partial differential equations numerically, a common strategy for parallelization involves decomposing the problem into smaller, independent tasks that can be solved simultaneously on different processors. In the context of using a fractional approximation R(A) to the matrix exponential function e^A, this decomposition is achieved through a partial fraction expansion.\n\nThe rational function R(z) is split into a sum of simpler terms. When this decomposition is applied to the matrix A, the problem is converted into solving several independent linear systems. These systems can then be computed in parallel. This approach is explicitly used to parallelize the solution, as each term in the partial fraction expansion can be handled by a separate processor.\n\nTherefore, the key factor that enables the conversion of the sequential algorithm into a parallel one is the ability to express the fractional approximation in a linear partial fraction form.\n\n*   **A) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions:** Nonlocal boundary conditions typically introduce long-range dependencies, which complicate, rather than facilitate, parallelization.\n*   **B) Stability analysis:** This is a crucial property of any numerical algorithm to ensure its reliability, but it is not the mechanism that enables parallel processing.\n*   **C) Complex roots of fractional approximation:** The location of the roots is related to the stability of the method, not its parallelization.\n*   **D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation:** This mathematical technique directly breaks the problem into independent sub-problems, which is the essence of parallel computation in this context.\n\n<<<D>>>"
