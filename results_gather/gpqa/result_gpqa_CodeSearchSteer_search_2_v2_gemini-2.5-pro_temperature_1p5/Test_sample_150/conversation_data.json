    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the principles of quantum mechanics for calculating the probability of a measurement outcome.\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the State Vector\n\nThe given state of the system is the column matrix (or vector) `|ψ⟩`:\n```\n|ψ⟩ =\n┌  -1 ┐\n│   2 │\n└   1 ┘\n```\nThe probability calculations in quantum mechanics require the state vector to be normalized. The squared norm of the state vector, `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`, is calculated as the inner product of the vector with its conjugate transpose.\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\nThe normalization constant is `1/√⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1/√6`.\nThe normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n```\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) *\n┌  -1 ┐\n│   2 │\n└   1 ┘\n```\n\n### Step 2: Find the Eigenvector for the Observable\n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix `P`:\n```\nP =\n┌     0      1/√2      0    ┐\n│   1/√2       0      1/√2  │\n└     0      1/√2      0    ┘\n```\nWe need to find the probability that the measurement will yield the value 0. This value corresponds to an eigenvalue of the operator `P`. We first need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.\n\nThis is done by solving the eigenvalue equation `P|v₀⟩ = λ|v₀⟩` for `λ = 0`:\n`P|v₀⟩ = 0`\n\nLet the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` be `[x, y, z]`. The matrix equation is:\n```\n┌     0      1/√2      0    ┐ ┌ x ┐   ┌ 0 ┐\n│   1/√2       0      1/√2  │ │ y │ = │ 0 │\n└     0      1/√2      0    ┘ └ z ┘   └ 0 ┘\n```\nThis yields a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0`\n3.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`\n\nFrom equations (1) and (3), we find that `y = 0`.\nFrom equation (2), we get `x + z = 0`, which implies `x = -z`.\n\nSo, any eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 must be of the form `[k, 0, -k]`, where `k` is any non-zero constant. For simplicity, we can choose `k = 1`.\n`|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]`\n\n### Step 3: Normalize the Eigenvector\n\nNext, we normalize the eigenvector `|v₀⟩`. The squared norm is:\n`⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = (1)² + (0)² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`\n\nThe normalization constant is `1/√2`. The normalized eigenvector, `|v₀_norm⟩`, is:\n```\n|v₀_norm⟩ = (1/√2) *\n┌  1 ┐\n│  0 │\n└ -1 ┘\n```\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability\n\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring a specific eigenvalue `λ` is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the corresponding normalized eigenvector `|v_λ_norm⟩` with the normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩`.\n`Prob(0) = |⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the inner product `⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩`:\n`⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) ⋅ ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1] )`\n`= (1/√2)(1/√6) * ( [1, 0, -1] ⋅ [-1, 2, 1] )`\n`= (1/√12) * ( (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) )`\n`= (1/√12) * (-1 + 0 - 1)`\n`= -2/√12`\nSince `√12 = √(4*3) = 2√3`, we have:\n`= -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n\nFinally, we square the magnitude of this result to find the probability:\n`Prob(0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\nThus, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
