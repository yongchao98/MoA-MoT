    "This problem is a classic example of the method of images in electrostatics. We want to find the total potential energy of the system composed of a point charge *q* and a grounded conducting sphere. A grounded sphere has a potential of zero.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Method of Images Setup**: The electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the induced charges on the grounded sphere's surface, can be perfectly replicated by an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge *q* and the image charge `q'` must make the potential on the sphere's surface (at radius R) equal to zero.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge *q* at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R*, the image charge `q'` and its distance *b* from the center are given by:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    This placement ensures that the potential V = k*q/r₁ + k*q'/r₂ is zero for any point on the surface of the sphere.\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to the distance *d* from the sphere's center. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n    A more direct method to calculate this energy is to use the formula for the energy of a charge distribution: `U = (1/2) * ∫ ρV dτ`. For a system consisting of a point charge and a conductor, this simplifies. The potential energy of the interaction is half the product of the point charge and the potential created at its location by the induced charges.\n\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    The potential `V_induced` at the location of charge *q* (a distance *d* from the center) is the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Induced Potential**: The distance between the real charge *q* (at *d*) and the image charge `q'` (at *b*) is `d - b`.\n    The potential at *d* due to `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    Now substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    `V_induced = -k * (Rq/d) / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    `V_induced = -k * Rq / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Final Energy Calculation**: Now substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * Rq / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, so the potential energy decreases as the charge is brought in from infinity.\n\n<<<A>>>"
