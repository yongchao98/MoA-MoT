    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem based on the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method for exoplanet detection.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Radial Velocity Method\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by measuring the small periodic shift in a star's spectral lines. This shift is caused by the Doppler effect as the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The magnitude of this wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (the component of its velocity along our line of sight). The maximum radial velocity observed is called the semi-amplitude (K).\n\n### 2. Relating Observations to Physical Quantities\n*   The wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n*   For Planet #1, the wavelength shift is Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms.\n*   For Planet #2, the wavelength shift is Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes is K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n### 3. The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula\nFor a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star is given by the formula:\n\nK = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (Mₛ)^(2/3)\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n*   Mₛ is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 4. Setting up the Ratio\nWe can write the formula for each of the two systems:\n\n*   K₁ = ( (2πG) / P₁ )^(1/3) * (mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) / (Mₛ₁)^(2/3)\n*   K₂ = ( (2πG) / P₂ )^(1/3) * (mₚ₂ sin(i₂)) / (Mₛ₂)^(2/3)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio K₂ / K₁.\n\n### 5. Simplifying the Ratio Based on Given Information\nThe problem provides the following crucial details which allow us to cancel out terms:\n*   The stars have the same mass: Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂.\n*   The planets have similar masses: mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂.\n*   It is reasonable to assume the orbital inclinations are similar (i₁ ≈ i₂), as no difference is stated. In the context of such problems, unless specified otherwise, we assume comparable observing conditions.\n\nBy dividing the equation for K₂ by the equation for K₁, the following terms cancel out: mₚ, Mₛ, sin(i), 2, π, and G.\n\n(K₂ / K₁) = [ (1/P₂)^(1/3) ] / [ (1/P₁)^(1/3) ]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(K₂ / K₁) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n### 6. Solving for the Period Ratio\nWe can now substitute the known value of the velocity ratio (K₂ / K₁ = 1.4) into the simplified equation and solve for the period ratio (P₂ / P₁).\n\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo isolate the period ratio, we cube both sides of the equation:\n\n1.4³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. To get this, we take the reciprocal:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n### 7. Conclusion\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option D. The planet with the larger radial velocity signature (Planet #2) is actually in a shorter-period orbit, which is consistent with Kepler's laws and the RV formula; a closer planet orbits faster and exerts a stronger, more rapid pull on its star.\n\n<<<D>>>"
