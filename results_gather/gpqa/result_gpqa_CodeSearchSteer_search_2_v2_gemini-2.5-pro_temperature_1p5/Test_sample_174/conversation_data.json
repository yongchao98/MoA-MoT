    "The problem requires us to determine the fraction of maximum power radiated at a specific angle and the wavelength dependence of the radiated power from an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution.\n\n1.  **Modeling the Radiating System:** A localized oscillating charge distribution, such as a spheroid, can be approximated by a multipole expansion. The lowest and typically dominant form of radiation is electric dipole radiation, unless the oscillating electric dipole moment is zero by symmetry. For a simple oscillation along the symmetry axis, an electric dipole model is the most appropriate starting point.\n\n2.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power (Electric Dipole):** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `C` is a constant dependent on the dipole moment and frequency, and `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\n3.  **Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    *   The maximum power (`A`) is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value, which is 1. This occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    *   The question asks for the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n    *   Fraction = `(Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power)` = `(C * sin²(30°)) / (C * sin²(90°))`\n    *   Since `sin(30°) = 1/2` and `sin(90°) = 1`, the fraction is `(1/2)² / 1² = 1/4`.\n\n4.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    *   The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (`ω⁴`).\n    *   The relationship between angular frequency (`ω`), speed of light (`c`), and wavelength (`λ`) is `ω = 2πc/λ`.\n    *   Therefore, the radiated power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴`, or `λ⁻⁴`. This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is a classic result for dipole radiation, also seen in phenomena like Rayleigh scattering.\n\n5.  **Considering Higher-Order Multipoles:** While the spheroid shape could support more complex oscillations like an electric quadrupole, this type of radiation is generally much weaker than dipole radiation. Electric quadrupole radiation also has a different angular dependence (e.g., `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`) and a much stronger wavelength dependence (`λ⁻⁶`). In the absence of information that the electric dipole moment is zero, the dominant radiation mechanism is assumed to be from the oscillating electric dipole.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the standard electric dipole radiation model, the fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` is 1/4, and the radiated power `f` has a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
