    "Based on the provided ¹H NMR data, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the data:\n\n1.  **Analysis of Molecular Formula:** The ¹H NMR data shows signals corresponding to a total of 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula for propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂) has 8 hydrogen atoms, which matches the data.\n    *   The molecular formula for butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   This eliminates Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate (options C and D).\n\n2.  **Signal Assignments for Propenyl Acetate:** The structure is CH₃–CH=CH–O–CO–CH₃.\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal corresponds to the three protons of the acetate methyl group (–CO–CH₃). It is a singlet because there are no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):** These signals are from the two protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (–CH=CH–).\n    *   **Allylic Protons (1.6 ppm):** This signal is from the methyl group attached to the double bond (CH₃–CH=).\n\n3.  **Distinguishing Between Cis and Trans Isomers:** The key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinyl protons.\n    *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This large coupling constant is characteristic of protons in a *trans* configuration on a double bond.\n    *   For comparison, the coupling constant for *cis* vinyl protons is typically in the range of 6-12 Hz. The observed value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the expected range for a *trans* relationship (12-18 Hz).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe number of protons confirms the compound is a propenyl acetate. The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons unequivocally indicates a trans geometry around the double bond. Therefore, the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
