    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to identify the available α-protons to determine where the enolate will form.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is quaternary (bonded to four other carbons) and has no protons.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 has one proton.\n    Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from the C6 position. This means the enolate will form with the double bond between C1 and C6. The regiochemistry is not in question.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a conjugate addition (1,4-addition). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The resulting product is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one with an `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached at the C6 position.\n5.  **IUPAC Naming**: According to IUPAC rules, the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Thus, the molecule is named as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexyl group is attached to carbon 3 of this chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we start numbering from the point of attachment. Thus, the original C6 of the ketone ring is now C1 for the substituent name.\n    *   Following the ring from this new C1:\n        *   C1 has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 is the carbonyl carbon (`=O`), so we have a `2-oxo` group.\n        *   C3 has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent is named `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition reaction. The base KOH deprotonates the 1-nitropropane, and the resulting nucleophile attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon). KOH removes one of these protons to form a nitronate anion, `CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`, which serves as the nucleophile.\n3.  **Electrophile**: The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as (E)-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN), which is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n4.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the (E)-but-2-enenitrile. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the C1 of nitropropane and the C3 of the butenenitrile.\n5.  **Product Structure and Naming**: After the attack and subsequent protonation by water, the resulting molecule is:\n    `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is six carbons long, so it is a `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   Numbering begins from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   A methyl group is on C3 (`3-methyl`).\n    *   A nitro group is on C4 (`4-nitro`).\n    *   The complete IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
