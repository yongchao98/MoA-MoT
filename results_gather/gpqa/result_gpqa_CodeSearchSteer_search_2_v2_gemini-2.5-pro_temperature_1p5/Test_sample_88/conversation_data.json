    "This multi-step synthesis problem requires a methodical, step-by-step identification of the products formed in each reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It is heated to a high temperature (240°C) with a strong base (KOH). These are harsh conditions known to induce cage rearrangements in polycyclic systems like adamantane, rather than simple substitution or elimination reactions which are hindered at bridgehead positions. This reaction is known in the chemical literature to produce **protoadamantan-4-one** (also known as tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one).\n\nThe provided spectral data for Product 1 is:\n*   **IR spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone (C=O) group.\n*   **¹H NMR spectrum:** The signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H) sum up to 14 protons. The molecular formula for an adamantanone isomer is C₁₀H₁₄O. The degrees of unsaturation for C₁₀H₁₄O is 4, which corresponds to the tricyclic cage structure (3 degrees) and one carbonyl group (1 degree). While the chemical shift at 4.79 ppm is highly unusual for a saturated cage ketone and does not match standard spectra for protoadamantan-4-one, the reaction conditions and other spectral features strongly point towards this rearranged ketone as the logical product. We will proceed assuming Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is used for the **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**, which converts ketones into alcohols. Therefore, the ketone group in Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl (alcohol) group, forming protoadamantan-4-ol. The problem states that the mixture is heated, which can cause the subsequent **dehydration** of the alcohol to form an alkene. The elimination of a water molecule from protoadamantan-4-ol is expected to yield the more stable alkene, **protoadamant-4-ene**. The formation of this C=C double bond is a crucial prerequisite for the next step. So, Product 2 is protoadamant-4-ene.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive **ozonolysis** reaction, which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. Since the double bond in protoadamant-4-ene is between two carbons (C4 and C5) that are each bonded to one hydrogen, the cleavage results in the formation of two aldehyde groups (-CHO).\n\nThe cleavage of the C4=C5 bond in the tricyclic protoadamantene framework opens one of the rings, resulting in a bicyclic dialdehyde. The parent structure is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane. The two new aldehyde groups are located at the positions corresponding to the original C4 and C5 atoms of the protoadamantene structure. A detailed structural analysis shows these positions to be C3 and C7 of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system. Thus, Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nWe need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding the acidic aldehyde protons, which would exchange with a deuterated solvent). In the structure of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde, the protons attached to carbons bearing the aldehyde groups (H-3 and H-7) will be the most deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent carbonyl group.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the molecule, H-3 and H-7 are chemically equivalent. We only need to analyze the neighbors of one of them, for instance, H-3. The carbon atom C3 is bonded to three other carbons: C2, C4, and C9. Each of these neighboring carbons (C2, C4, and C9) is a methylene group (-CH₂) and carries two protons.\n*   **Neighbor 1:** The two protons on C2.\n*   **Neighbor 2:** The two protons on C4.\n*   **Neighbor 3:** The two protons on C9.\n\nAccording to the **n+1 rule**, the signal for H-3 will be split by all these neighboring protons. However, the magnitude of the coupling constant (J-coupling) depends on the dihedral angle between the protons. In the chair-chair conformation of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system, we expect to see two distinct types of couplings:\n1.  **Triplet:** H-3 will couple with the two geminal protons on the adjacent C9 bridgehead carbon. These two protons are roughly equidistant and will split the H-3 signal into a triplet.\n2.  **Triplet of Triplets:** Each peak of this initial triplet will be further split by the four protons on C2 and C4. Due to the molecular geometry, these four protons (two on C2, two on C4) are also roughly equivalent in their interaction with H-3. Coupling to these four equivalent protons would ideally result in a pentet (n+1 = 4+1 = 5). However, a more refined analysis often shows that couplings within the two six-membered rings are distinct from the coupling across the bridge. More commonly, the four protons on C2 and C4 will split the signal into another triplet.\n\nTherefore, H-3 couples with two protons on C9 to form a triplet, and each line of this triplet is further split into a triplet by the four protons (in two sets of two) on C2 and C4. The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
