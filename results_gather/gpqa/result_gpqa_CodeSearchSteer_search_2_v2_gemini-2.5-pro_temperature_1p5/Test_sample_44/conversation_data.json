    "Here is the step-by-step calculation for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Infinite Potential Well:** For a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by `En = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`, where `n` is a positive integer (n=1, 2, 3, ...). The problem defines `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`, so the single-particle energy levels are `En = n²E`.\n2.  **Spin-1/2 Particles:** The particles are fermions.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since the particles are identical fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by its energy level (n) and its spin (up or down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\n*   n=1: E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n*   n=2: E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   n=3: E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   n=4: E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n\n### Calculation of System Energies\n\n#### Ground State\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels with the four particles, following the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n*   Two particles go into the `n=1` level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   The remaining two particles go into the `n=2` level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n*   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\n*   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n#### First Excited State\n\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level. This means moving one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n\n*   Two particles remain in the `n=1` level.\n*   One particle remains in the `n=2` level.\n*   One particle is promoted to the `n=3` level.\n\nThe total energy is:\n*   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\n*   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n#### Second Excited State\n\nTo find the second excited state, we look for the next lowest energy configuration after the first excited state. There are a few possibilities starting from the ground state configuration:\n\n1.  Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n2.  Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n3.  Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nComparing the possible energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest value is 18E. Therefore, this is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
