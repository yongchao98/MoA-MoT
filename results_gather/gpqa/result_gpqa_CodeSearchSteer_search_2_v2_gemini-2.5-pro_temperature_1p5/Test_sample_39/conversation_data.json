    "The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common piece of laboratory slang used by chemists, particularly in organic chemistry. It refers to the difficulty or failure to separate two or more compounds in a mixture. This situation is most frequently encountered during chromatography.\n\nIn a chemistry lab, chromatography is a fundamental technique used to purify compounds from a mixture. Methods like Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography separate compounds based on their different affinities for a stationary phase (a solid like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent that moves through the stationary phase). This affinity is primarily governed by a compound's polarity.\n\nWhen two compounds have very similar polarities, they interact with the stationary and mobile phases in an almost identical way. As a result, they move through the chromatography system at nearly the same speed.\n*   On a TLC plate, which is used to monitor a reaction or find a good separation solvent, this results in the spots for each compound appearing at the same position, seeming to be \"on top of each other\".\n*   In column chromatography, which is used for larger-scale purification, this phenomenon is called \"co-elution,\" where the different compounds exit the column at the same time, making them impossible to collect in separate fractions.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is expressing frustration that the compounds they are trying to separate have nearly identical polarities, making them very difficult to purify using this standard technique.\n\nOf the options provided:\n*   **A) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a physical property of chiral molecules and is not the basis for common separation techniques like chromatography.\n*   **B) Similar boiling points:** While similar boiling points would make separation by distillation difficult, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is more specifically associated with the visual output of chromatography (overlapping spots).\n*   **C) Bonding through non-covalent interactions:** While the separation itself relies on non-covalent interactions with the chromatography medium, this option incorrectly implies the compounds are sticking to each other, rather than sticking to the medium with similar strength.\n*   **D) Similar polarities:** This is the direct cause of poor separation in chromatography, the most common purification technique in this context, and accurately explains why the compounds would be \"on top of each other.\"\n\n<<<D>>>"
