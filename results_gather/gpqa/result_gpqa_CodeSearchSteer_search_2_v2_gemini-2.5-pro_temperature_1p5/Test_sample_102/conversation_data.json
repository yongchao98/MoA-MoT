    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1\n*   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other. This substitution pattern is key to solving the synthesis puzzle. Let's analyze the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe challenge is to place the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group in a *meta* position relative to the other two substituents. This often requires a multi-step strategy involving the temporary use of a directing group, which is later modified or removed. Many of the options involve the sequence of diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) followed by reaction with hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2). This specific sequence is used to remove an amino group (-NH2) from an aromatic ring, a process called deamination. This strongly suggests the synthesis involves creating a precursor amine, carrying out further substitutions, and then removing the amino group to achieve the final product.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis route fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3 does not work on aniline (the product of step ii). The basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a salt that deactivates the ring and prevents the desired reaction.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\nSteps (i) through (iv) result in the conversion of benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, which is then converted back to benzene via diazotization and deamination. This sequence of steps to simply return to the starting material makes the entire route inefficient and illogical.\n\n**D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis route begins with bromobenzene. Nitration (ii) would primarily yield 4-bromonitrobenzene. Subsequent acylation (iii) would add the acetyl group at a position ortho to the bromine and meta to the nitro group. This pathway does not lead to the required 1,3,5-substitution pattern of the final product.\n\n**C) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence presents a plausible, albeit complex, path to the target molecule:\n*   **i) Benzene → Acetophenone:** Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** Bromination occurs at the *meta* position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone:** This is a crucial step. While nitration is strongly directed to position 5 (para to -Br, meta to -COCH3), the formation of the 4-nitro isomer (ortho to -Br, meta to -COCH3) is necessary for this specific path to work. We must assume this isomer is formed and carried forward.\n*   **iv) 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone:** The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH2). This new group is a powerful *ortho, para*-director (though it becomes a *meta*-director when protonated in strong acid).\n*   **v) 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone:** A second nitration is performed. The existing substituents (-COCH3 at C1 and -Br at C3) both direct the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n*   **vi) 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone → Diazonium salt:** The amino group at position 4 is converted into a diazonium salt.\n*   **vii) Diazonium salt → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The diazonium group is removed using H3PO2 and replaced with a hydrogen atom. This deamination step leaves the final desired product with the acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups in the correct 1,3,5-pattern.\n\nAlthough a more direct three-step synthesis (acylation, then bromination, then nitration to the 5-position) seems possible, this longer route presented in option C is chemically sound and utilizes a classic strategy (installing and later removing a directing group) to ensure the specific final arrangement of substituents. Among the given choices, it is the only viable pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>"
