    "The problem asks to identify compound X (C11H12O) which, upon reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K, yields a product with specific ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR spectra.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Product's NMR Spectra**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the product from the given NMR data.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   `δ 2.28 (3H, s)` and `δ 2.31 (3H, s)`: These two singlets each integrating to 3 protons indicate the presence of two methyl (CH₃) groups that are not adjacent to any protons. This suggests they could be attached to a quaternary carbon, a carbonyl group, a double bond with no adjacent protons, or an aromatic ring.\n    *   `δ 7.08 (2H, d)` and `δ 7.71 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, in the aromatic region is highly characteristic of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   `δ 6.75 (1H, d)` and `δ 7.68 (1H, d)`: These two doublets, each for one proton, are in the vinylic region, indicating a disubstituted carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The fact that they are doublets implies they are coupled to each other.\n\n*   **¹³C-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   `δ 197.7 (1C, s)`: This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically a ketone or aldehyde. Its downfield position suggests it is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring.\n    *   `δ 21.3 (1C, s)` and `δ 28.4 (1C, s)`: These are the signals for the two methyl carbons.\n    *   The remaining signals `126.9 (2C)`, `127.1 (1C)`, `129.1 (2C)`, `130.3 (1C)`, `141.5 (1C)`, `144.1 (1C)` are in the aromatic and alkene region. The presence of two signals each corresponding to two carbons (`126.9` and `129.1`) further confirms the symmetry of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    *   The data points to a para-substituted ring. One substituent is a methyl group (e.g., the CH₃ at δ 2.31 and 21.3 ppm). This gives a para-tolyl group (p-CH₃C₆H₄-).\n    *   There is a ketone group (C=O, δ 197.7 ppm) and another methyl group (e.g., the CH₃ at δ 2.28 and 28.4 ppm). This suggests an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   The remaining atoms form a -CH=CH- linker.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the structure **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**:\n        `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. This matches the starting material. This structure is fully consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n**2. Identifying Compound X and the Reaction**\n\nNow we need to determine which of the starting materials (Compound X) would yield 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one under the given reaction conditions. The reaction is an isomerization, as the product has the same molecular formula as the reactant.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction of an epoxide with DABCO is a known transformation. Specifically, the DABCO-mediated Meinwald rearrangement converts terminal epoxides (those with a `-CH(O)CH₂` group) substituted with an aryl or alkenyl group into the corresponding methyl ketone. The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic opening of the epoxide ring by DABCO, followed by a hydride shift and elimination of the DABCO catalyst.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options for Compound X:**\n    *   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH₃)`. This molecule contains a phenyl group, not the p-tolyl group found in the product. Furthermore, it is an internal, not a terminal, epoxide. Its rearrangement would not yield the identified product.\n    *   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This molecule has the correct molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O) and contains a p-tolyl group. It is a terminal vinyl epoxide. According to the Meinwald rearrangement, the `-CH(O)CH₂` group will isomerize to a `-CO-CH₃` group. This reaction would produce `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`, which is exactly the product we deduced from the NMR spectra.\n    *   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** This is `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`, which has the formula C₁₀H₁₀O, not matching the given C₁₁H₁₂O.\n    *   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This molecule has the formula C₁₂H₁₂O, which is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction product is 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one, as determined from the NMR spectra. This product is formed from the DABCO-mediated Meinwald rearrangement of a terminal vinyl epoxide. Of the choices given, only 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (Option B) is the correct precursor that fits the molecular formula and would yield the observed product under the specified conditions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
