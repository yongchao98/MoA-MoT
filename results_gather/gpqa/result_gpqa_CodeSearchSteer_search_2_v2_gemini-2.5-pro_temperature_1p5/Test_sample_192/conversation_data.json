    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) changes with distance (`r`), we can use the given information about how the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`).\n\n1.  **Given Relationship:** The number of stars observed per unit of parallax, let's call this `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n2.  **Parallax and Distance Relationship:** Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Specifically, for a distance `r` in parsecs and a parallax `plx` in arcseconds, the relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n3.  **Relating the Distributions:** We want to find `dN/dr`. We can use the chain rule from calculus to relate the rate of change with respect to distance to the rate of change with respect to parallax:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n4.  **Find the Derivative:** We need to differentiate the parallax-distance relationship with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr (1/r) = -1/r^2`\n    Since we are interested in how the number of stars changes with the magnitude of the distance, we can use the absolute value: `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2`.\n\n5.  **Substitution:** Now, substitute the known relationships into the chain rule equation:\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\n6.  **Final Step:** To get the relationship solely in terms of `r`, replace `plx` with `1/r`:\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance `r` changes in proportion to `r^3`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
