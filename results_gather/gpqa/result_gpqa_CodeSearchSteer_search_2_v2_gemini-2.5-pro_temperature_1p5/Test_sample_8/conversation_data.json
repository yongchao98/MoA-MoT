    "To determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry, we must analyze the point group of each molecule. The C3h point group contains a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (ﾏド) perpendicular to that axis.\n\n*   **A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:** This molecule is also known as mellitic trianhydride. It is a planar molecule with a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride groups. This high degree of symmetry places it in the D3h point group, not C3h. While D3h includes the C3 and ﾏド symmetry elements, it also has additional elements like three C2 axes and three vertical mirror planes, making it a different, higher-symmetry group.\n*   **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:** This molecule is a larger, more complex analog based on a triphenylene core. Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry. The addition of the fused furanone rings in a symmetrical fashion would preserve this high symmetry, resulting in a molecule with D3h symmetry, not C3h.\n*   **C) triisopropyl borate:** The structure of triisopropyl borate is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. It consists of a central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms in a planar trigonal arrangement (the BO3 unit). A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to this plane. The overall symmetry depends on the conformation of the three isopropyl groups. A specific, stable conformation exists where the three methine C-H bonds lie in the BO3 plane. In this arrangement, one methyl group of each isopropyl unit is positioned above the plane, and the other is below. This specific propeller-like conformation results in the BO3 plane being a horizontal mirror plane (ﾏド), making the molecule's point group C3h.\n*   **D) quinuclidine:** Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) is a highly symmetrical, cage-like molecule. It possesses a C3 rotational axis that passes through the nitrogen and the bridgehead C-H group on the opposite side. However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane. Instead, it has three vertical mirror planes (ﾏプ) that contain the C3 axis. Therefore, its point group is C3v.\n\nBased on this analysis, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that fits the C3h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
