    "To clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the sum of the natural energy uncertainties (linewidths) of each level. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle can be expressed as:\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (natural linewidth).\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the quantum state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nWe can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty for each state using the formula ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime.\n\n**1. Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for the first state (E1):**\n*   Lifetime (τ1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n*   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**2. Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for the second state (E2):**\n*   Lifetime (τ2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n*   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Determine the minimum energy difference for the levels to be resolved:**\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference between the two levels must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties.\n*   Required Energy Difference > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n*   Required Energy Difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n*   Required Energy Difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   Required Energy Difference > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4. Compare this requirement with the given options:**\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.\n\n<<<B>>>"
