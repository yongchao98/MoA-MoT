    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is a simplifying assumption that treats the interaction of a probe with a nucleus as a collection of interactions with individual, quasi-free nucleons. This approximation is founded on a set of core ideas that allow the complex many-body problem to be reduced to a more manageable single-body problem.\n\nThe key assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is the primary characteristic of the impulse approximation. It posits that the incoming probe (for example, an electron or a neutrino) interacts with just one nucleon at a time, while the other nucleons in the nucleus act as spectators. This is often referred to as the \"one-body\" assumption, where the total nuclear current is approximated as the sum of individual nucleon currents.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption means that neither the incoming probe before the interaction nor the struck nucleon after the interaction interacts significantly with the rest of the nucleus. This concept, often termed \"nuclear transparency,\" implies the absence of significant initial-state and final-state interactions. If the struck nucleon were to re-interact with the residual nucleus, it would complicate the picture beyond a simple single-nucleon interaction.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** This aspect of the approximation assumes that the interaction happens over a very short time scale. During this brief moment, the potential energy binding the nucleon to the nucleus is considered negligible compared to the energy transferred in the interaction. The nucleon is therefore treated as being \"free\" during the collision process.\n\nThe assumption that the quarks internal to the nucleon are non-relativistic (Assumption 3) is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation for nuclear systems. The impulse approximation deals with nucleons as the effective degrees of freedom, and while the nucleon's internal structure (governed by quarks and gluons) determines its response to the probe, the approximation itself is about how the many-nucleon system is treated. In fact, many modern calculations apply the impulse approximation within a relativistic framework for the nucleons themselves.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
