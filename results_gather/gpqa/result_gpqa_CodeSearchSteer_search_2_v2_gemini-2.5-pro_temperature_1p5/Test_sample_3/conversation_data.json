    "In a universe with magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations would be altered to account for magnetic charges and their currents, creating a greater symmetry between electricity and magnetism.\n\nThe two equations that would change are:\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇⋅B) is zero, which mathematically means there are no isolated magnetic poles. If monopoles existed, this law would be modified to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the magnetic charge density (ρm).\n\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction**: This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇×E). If magnetic monopoles existed and could move, they would create a magnetic current (Jm). This magnetic current would also produce a circulating electric field, so a new term would be added to Faraday's Law to account for it.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is the one that identifies changes to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<B>>>"
