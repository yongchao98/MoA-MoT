    "### Analysis of the Molecular Transition\n\n1.  **Identify the Model and Energy Levels**: The problem specifies a diatomic molecule (X-Y) described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy of a state is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies.\n    *   Vibrational Energy: `Ev = ħω(v + 1/2)`, where `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   Rotational Energy: `EJ = (ħ²/2I) * J(J + 1)`, where `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n    *   Total Energy: `E_v,J = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * J(J + 1)`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Ground State**: The fundamental or ground state is the state with the lowest possible energy, which occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum values: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   `E_ground = E_0,0 = ħω(0 + 1/2) + 0 = (1/2)ħω`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Next Lowest Energy State and Selection Rules**: The problem asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This requires considering the selection rules for photon absorption.\n    *   **Vibrational Selection Rule**: For an absorption that excites vibration, `Δv = +1`.\n    *   **Rotational Selection Rule**: For a rovibrational transition in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, `ΔJ = ±1`.\n    *   Starting from the ground state (J=0), the only possible rotational change is `ΔJ = +1`. A change of `ΔJ = -1` is not possible. The `ΔJ = 0` transition (forming a Q-branch) is generally forbidden for simple diatomic molecules.\n    *   Therefore, the transition from the ground state `(v=0, J=0)` to the next lowest-energy *rovibrational* state is to `(v=1, J=1)`. This is the first transition in the R-branch of the spectrum.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon**: The energy of the photon must equal the energy difference (`ΔE`) between the final and initial states.\n    *   Initial State Energy (`E_i`): `E_0,0 = (1/2)ħω`\n    *   Final State Energy (`E_f`): `E_1,1 = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I`\n    *   Energy Difference (`ΔE`): `ΔE = E_f - E_i = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + ħ²/I`.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n**Constants and Given Values**:\n*   Mass of atom X (`Mx`): 20 amu = 20 * 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n*   Mass of atom Y (`My`): 2 amu = 2 * 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n*   Bond length (`R`): 2 Å = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Angular frequency of vibration (`ω`): 4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   Reduced Planck's constant (`ħ`): 1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   Speed of light (`c`): 3 × 10⁸ m/s\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the reduced mass (μ)**\nThe reduced mass is the effective mass of the two-body system.\n`μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`\n`μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu`\n`μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the moment of inertia (I)**\nThe moment of inertia depends on the reduced mass and the square of the bond length.\n`I = μ * R²`\n`I ≈ (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)²`\n`I ≈ (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 × 10⁻²⁰ m²)`\n`I ≈ 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the energy difference (ΔE) of the transition**\nThis energy is the sum of the vibrational and rotational energy changes.\n*   **Vibrational Energy Change (`ħω`)**:\n    `ΔE_vib = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J`\n*   **Rotational Energy Change (`ħ²/I`)**:\n    `ΔE_rot = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.21 × 10⁻²³ J`\n*   **Total Energy Change (`ΔE`)**:\n    `ΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot`\n    `ΔE ≈ (4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.00921 × 10⁻²⁰ J) ≈ 4.227 × 10⁻²⁰ J`\n    (Note that the rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational one.)\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the photon's momentum (p)**\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum by the equation `E = pc`.\n`p = ΔE / c`\n`p ≈ (4.227 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 × 10⁸ m/s)`\n`p ≈ 1.409 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\nThis calculated value is very close to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**: The momentum of the absorbed photon should be approximately 1.4 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s.\n\n<<<D>>>"
