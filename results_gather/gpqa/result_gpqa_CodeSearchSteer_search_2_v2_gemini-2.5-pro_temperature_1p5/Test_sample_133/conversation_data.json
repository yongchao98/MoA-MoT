    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactions\n\nTwo types of reactions will occur when these substances are mixed:\n*   **Neutralization:** Hydrogen ions (H+) from the acids will react with hydroxide ions (OH-) from the base to form water. The general equation for a strong acid and strong base is:\n    H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n*   **Precipitation:** Barium ions (Ba²⁺) from the barium hydroxide will react with sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) from the sulfuric acid to form a solid precipitate of barium sulfate.\n    Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)\n\n### 2. Calculate the Moles of Reactants\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ ions:**\n    *   From HCl: 0.500 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.10 mol H⁺\n    *   From H₂SO₄: 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 H⁺/H₂SO₄ = 0.18 mol H⁺\n    *   **Total moles of H⁺ = 0.10 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ ions:**\n    *   From Ba(OH)₂: 0.200 L × 0.5 mol/L × 2 OH⁻/Ba(OH)₂ = 0.20 mol OH⁻\n    *   **Total moles of OH⁻ = 0.20 mol**\n\n*   **Moles for precipitation:**\n    *   Moles of Ba²⁺ from Ba(OH)₂: 0.200 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Moles of SO₄²⁻ from H₂SO₄: 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n\n### 3. Determine Heat from Neutralization\n\nFirst, determine the limiting reactant for the neutralization reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻.\n*   Moles of H⁺ = 0.28 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ = 0.20 mol\n\nThe hydroxide ion (OH⁻) is the limiting reactant. Therefore, 0.20 moles of water will be formed.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -13.7 kcal/mol.\n*   **Heat from neutralization (q_neut)** = 0.20 mol H₂O × (-13.7 kcal/mol) = **-2.74 kcal**\n\n### 4. Determine Heat from Precipitation\n\nNext, determine the limiting reactant for the precipitation of BaSO₄.\n*   Moles of Ba²⁺ = 0.10 mol\n*   Moles of SO₄²⁻ = 0.09 mol\n\nThe sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) is the limiting reactant. Therefore, 0.09 moles of BaSO₄ will precipitate.\n\nThe enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO₄ is approximately -4.64 kcal/mol.\n*   **Heat from precipitation (q_precip)** = 0.09 mol BaSO₄ × (-4.64 kcal/mol) = **-0.4176 kcal**\n\n### 5. Calculate Total Enthalpy Change\n\nThe total enthalpy of neutralization for the overall process is the sum of the heat released from the neutralization and precipitation reactions.\n*   **Total Enthalpy (ΔH)** = q_neut + q_precip\n*   ΔH = -2.74 kcal + (-0.4176 kcal)\n*   ΔH = **-3.1576 kcal**\n\nLooking at the options provided, the calculated value of -3.1576 kcal is closest to -2.72 kcal. This discrepancy might arise from using slightly different standard enthalpy values in the problem's source or a simplification that ignores the heat of precipitation. For instance, if only the neutralization is considered (-2.74 kcal), the answer is very close to -2.72 kcal. Let's assume the question primarily focuses on the main neutralization component.\n\nFinal calculated value considering only neutralization is -2.74 kcal. The closest answer is B. If we include precipitation, the value is -3.16 kcal, which is not close to any option. Option C is in kJ (-16.0 kJ / 4.184 kJ/kcal = -3.82 kcal), which matches option A. Let's re-examine.\n\nPerhaps a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization should be used. Some sources list it as -57.1 kJ/mol, which is -13.6 kcal/mol.\n*   q_neut = 0.20 mol * (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal.\nThis matches option B exactly.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO4 + 2H2O, which might be different. However, the calculation based on a standard enthalpy of neutralization of -13.6 kcal/mol for strong acids and bases gives a direct answer.\n\n**Calculation with -13.6 kcal/mol:**\n*   Heat from neutralization = 0.20 mol * (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal.\n\nThis aligns perfectly with option B. The problem might be simplified to only consider the neutralization of the limiting reagent (OH⁻ ions) with the standard heat of neutralization.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1. Moles H+ = 0.28 mol\n2. Moles OH- = 0.20 mol\n3. Moles H2O formed = 0.20 mol (OH- is limiting)\n4. Enthalpy of neutralization = 0.20 mol * (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
