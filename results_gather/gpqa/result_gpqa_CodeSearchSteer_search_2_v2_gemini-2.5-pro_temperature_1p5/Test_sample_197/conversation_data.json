    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we can use the provided stability constants and the concentration of the thiocyanate ligand.\n\n### 1. Understand the System\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) and thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) form a series of complexes. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, c(Co), is the sum of the free Co²⁺ ions and the different thiocyanato complexes:\n*c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]*\n\n### 2. Use Stability Constants\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (β):\n*   [Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nBy substituting these into the equation for the total cobalt concentration, we get:\n*c(Co) = [Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)*\n\n### 3. Calculate the Fraction\nThe goal is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] relative to the total cobalt concentration. This is the mole fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato complex multiplied by 100.\n\nThe fraction α₂ is given by:\nα₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\nSubstituting the expressions from above:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe term [Co²⁺] cancels out, simplifying the equation:\n**α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)**\n\n### 4. Substitute the Given Values\nNow, we plug the given values into this formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator (let's call it S):\n*   S = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\n*   S = 1 + (0.9) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\n*   S = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n*   S = 2.3646\n\nNext, calculate the value of the numerator:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction α₂:\n*   α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n### 5. Convert to Percentage\nTo get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\n*   Percentage = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
