    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identification of the Starting Material:**\n    *   The molecular formula is C₈H₉NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2\\*8 + 2 + 1 - 9) / 2 = 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a C=O or C=C bond).\n    *   The ¹H-NMR data provides key structural clues:\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a -CH₂- group. The doublet (d) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH), which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the presence of a -CH₂-CHO group (a phenylacetaldehyde fragment).\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are classic indicators of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂) group attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   Assembling these fragments, the starting compound is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The structure is consistent with the molecular formula and all NMR data.\n\n2.  **Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate formed is 4-formylmethylbenzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   **Step 2: H₂O, Heat:** Treating an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt with heat results in its hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction converts the diazonium salt intermediate into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** The product from the previous step, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that possesses acidic α-protons (on the carbon between the ring and the carbonyl group). In the presence of a base (KOH) and heat, it undergoes a self-aldol condensation.\n        *   First, the base removes an α-proton to form an enolate ion.\n        *   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (structure D).\n        *   Because the reaction is heated, this intermediate undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). A double bond is formed between the α and β carbons, resulting in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This product is particularly stable due to the extended conjugation between the aromatic rings, the newly formed C=C double bond, and the C=O group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction sequence transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a base-catalyzed self-aldol condensation with dehydration to yield the final product.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n*   **Intermediate:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde\n*   **Final Product (after aldol condensation):** 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct structure is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
