    "The note on your colleague's desk provides a size estimate for a Feynman diagram calculation. This expression, `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`, contains several clues, but the most direct indicator of the number of loops is the factor involving `4π`.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram introduces a factor of `1/(4π)^2` into the expression for the amplitude, after performing the integration over the loop momentum. This factor arises from the volume of the angular integration in four-dimensional momentum space.\n\nThe expression found on the note contains the term `1/(4pi)^6`. By comparing this with the general formula for an L-loop diagram, we can deduce the number of loops:\n\n`(1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\nBy equating the exponents, we find that `2 * L = 6`, which gives `L = 3`.\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram must have contained three loops. The other terms in the expression, such as the coupling constants (`alpha^3`, `g^2`), numerical factors (`sqrt(2)`, `8`), and the ratio of energy scales (`(Q/M)^2`), relate to the specific interactions, particles, and kinematics of the theory, but the power of `1/(4pi)` is a robust indicator of the number of loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
