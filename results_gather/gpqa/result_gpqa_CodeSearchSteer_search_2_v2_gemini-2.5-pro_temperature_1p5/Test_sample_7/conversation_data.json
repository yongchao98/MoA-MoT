  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Single Mutants\nFirst, we look at the effect of each individual gene knock-out on resistance compared to the 100% resistance of the wild-type (control) plant.\n*   **g1 mutant (75% resistance):** The loss of G1 function leads to a partial loss of resistance (25% reduction). This indicates that G1 contributes to the plant's defense, but it is not the sole factor.\n*   **g2 mutant (0% resistance):** The loss of G2 function results in a complete loss of resistance. This shows that G2 is an essential gene for the resistance pathway. Without a functional G2, the entire defense mechanism fails.\n*   **g3 mutant (50% resistance):** The loss of G3 function causes a 50% reduction in resistance. This means G3 plays a more significant role in resistance than G1, but it is also not the only gene involved.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Double Mutants to Determine Gene Interactions\nThe phenotypes of the double mutants are crucial for understanding how the genes work together in a pathway. This is where we test for epistasis, which occurs when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another.\n\n*   **g1g2 mutant (0% resistance):** The resistance level of the g1g2 double mutant is 0%. This is identical to the phenotype of the g2 single mutant (0% resistance). When the phenotype of a double mutant matches the phenotype of one of the single mutants, it indicates epistasis. In this case, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This genetic relationship typically means that G2 acts upstream of G1 in the same pathway.\n*   **g2g3 mutant (0% resistance):** Similarly, the resistance of the g2g3 double mutant is 0%, which is identical to the g2 single mutant phenotype. Therefore, **G2 is also epistatic to G3**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G3.\n*   **The role of G2 as a Transcription Factor:** The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) that acts upstream of other genes. Our analysis shows that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. The complete loss of resistance in the g2 mutant and its epistatic relationship with both G1 and G3 strongly support the conclusion that **G2 is the transcription factor**, which activates both G1 and G3.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the g1g3 Interaction\n*   **g1g3 mutant (10% resistance):** The g1 single mutant has 75% resistance, and the g3 single mutant has 50%. The double mutant g1g3 has only 10% resistance. This phenotype is much more severe than either of the single mutant phenotypes. This synergistic effect indicates that G1 and G3 likely function in two separate, parallel pathways that both contribute to the final resistance phenotype. When both pathways are knocked out, the effect is greater than simply adding their individual effects.\n*   The term **gene redundancy** is often used to describe a situation where two or more genes perform similar or parallel functions, such that the loss of both has a much greater effect than the loss of just one. While not perfectly redundant (as single mutants have effects), this is the most fitting description among the choices for two genes acting in parallel to contribute to a common outcome.\n*   There is no epistasis between G1 and G3, because the g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as either the g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) phenotype.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\nLet's evaluate the given choices based on our analysis:\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. The data strongly suggests G2, not G1, is the transcription factor.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:* This is a reasonable description of their parallel, synergistic function.\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* This part is factually incorrect based on the data. However, this error is present in other plausible options as well, suggesting a possible flaw in the question's options. Given that the first two points are the strongest conclusions from the data, this option remains a strong candidate.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is incorrect. Pleiotropy refers to one gene having multiple effects and does not correctly describe the interaction between G1 and G3. The epistasis claim is also incorrect.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This is less likely. While having the same promoter is a plausible hypothesis for co-regulation by G2, it is a specific molecular mechanism that is not directly proven by the phenotype data. \"Gene redundancy\" is a better description of the functional genetic interaction observed. The epistasis claim is also incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate description of the genetic interactions is that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3, which function in parallel, partially redundant pathways. Option B aligns best with these conclusions, despite an incorrect statement about epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
