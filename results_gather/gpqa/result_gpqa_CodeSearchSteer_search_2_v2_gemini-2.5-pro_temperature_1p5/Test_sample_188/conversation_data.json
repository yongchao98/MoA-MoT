    "Spontaneous symmetry breaking of a continuous symmetry gives rise to massless (or light, if the symmetry is also explicitly broken) particles known as Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Let's examine each option:\n\n*   **A) Phonon:** In a crystalline solid, the continuous translational and rotational symmetries of free space are broken by the formation of a regular lattice. The atoms are no longer free to be anywhere but are fixed in a specific periodic arrangement. Phonons are the quantized modes of vibration of this lattice and are the Nambu-Goldstone bosons corresponding to the spontaneously broken translational symmetry.\n\n*   **C) Magnon:** In a ferromagnet, the spins of the atoms align in a particular direction below the Curie temperature, spontaneously breaking the rotational symmetry of the spin system. Magnons, or quantized spin waves, are the collective excitations corresponding to this broken symmetry and are the associated Nambu-Goldstone bosons.\n\n*   **D) Pion:** In the theory of strong interactions (Quantum Chromodynamics), in the limit of massless quarks, there exists a global chiral symmetry. This symmetry is spontaneously broken by the QCD vacuum, giving rise to massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Since the up and down quarks have a small but non-zero mass, this chiral symmetry is not exact. As a result, the pions are not perfectly massless but are very light \"pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons\".\n\n*   **B) Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is a topologically stable, particle-like solution of a non-linear field theory. It is classified by a topological quantum number (a winding number), not by being a mode of a broken symmetry generator. While skyrmions can arise in theories that also feature spontaneous symmetry breaking (for example, the original Skyrme model describes baryons as solitons of the pion fields, where pions are Goldstone bosons), the skyrmion itself is a topological defect, not a Nambu-Goldstone boson.\n\nTherefore, the skyrmion is the effective particle on this list that is not directly a Nambu-Goldstone boson of a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
