    "To determine the lower limit on the redshift for detecting neutral hydrogen clouds with ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength at which Earth's atmosphere becomes transparent to light.\n\nThe absorption in question occurs at the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) wavelength, which has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Ångstroms (Å). This wavelength falls in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nEarth's atmosphere blocks most UV radiation, and ground-based telescopes can only detect light that passes through an \"atmospheric window\". The atmosphere's transparency begins in the near-UV and optical range, with significant transmission starting at wavelengths longer than about 3200-3300 Å. Therefore, for the Lyα absorption line to be detectable from the ground, its wavelength must be shifted by the expansion of the universe from 1216 Å into this observable range.\n\nThe relationship between the rest wavelength (λ_rest), the observed wavelength (λ_obs), and the redshift (z) is given by the formula:\nλ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we must use the minimum observable wavelength, which is the atmospheric cutoff. While some transmission exists down to 3000 Å, a more practical limit for telescope efficiency is often cited as slightly higher. Let's calculate the redshift corresponding to an observed wavelength that is clearly within the ground-based optical window.\n\nUsing a conservative practical limit for the atmospheric cutoff, for example, 3500 Å:\nz = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1\nz = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.88 - 1\nz ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculated redshift is very close to 1.9. Let's examine the options provided:\n*   A redshift of 1.2 would shift the Lyα line to about 2675 Å, which is still in the UV and blocked by the atmosphere.\n*   A redshift of 1.9 shifts the Lyα line to approximately 3526 Å, placing it at the edge of the optical window, making it observable by ground-based telescopes.\n*   Redshifts of 2.4 and 3 would shift the line to 4134 Å and 4864 Å, respectively. While these are easily observable, they do not represent the *lower limit* for detection.\n\nThus, the minimum redshift must be high enough to move the 1216 Å line to at least the ~3300-3500 Å range.\n\n<<<D>>>"
