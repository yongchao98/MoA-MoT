    "To determine the velocity of particle A, we apply the principle of conservation of energy to the annihilation process.\n\nThe process is:\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\n**1. Initial State Energy ($E_i$):**\nThe process begins with a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). Since the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" its kinetic energy is considered negligible. Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.\n\nThe rest energy of a single proton is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n\n$E_i = E_{p,rest} + E_{\\bar{p},rest} = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_i = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Final State Energy ($E_f$):**\nThe annihilation produces four particles of type A ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$). We are given that the rest energy of each particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nSince the initial system is effectively at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the four final particles must move in such a way that their total momentum is also zero. This implies that the total energy will be distributed equally among the four identical particles.\n\nThe total final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles. The relativistic energy ($E_A$) of a single particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n$E_f = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy:**\nBy equating the initial and final energies ($E_i = E_f$), we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\n$1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n**4. Calculating the Velocity:**\nNow, we can use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity ($v$) of the A particles.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for $v/c$:\n\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
