    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\nFirst, we calculate the new concentration of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid:**\n    Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.02000 L\n    Concentration = 0.05 M\n    Moles = 0.05 mol/L * 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol\n\n*   **Concentration after dilution:**\n    Total volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n    New Concentration [CH₃COOH] = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**\n\n### 2. Titration Reaction\nAcetic acid, a weak acid, reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base:\nCH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa (sodium acetate) + H₂O\n\n### 3. pH at 25% Titration\nAt this stage, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution containing the remaining acetic acid (a weak acid) and the newly formed sodium acetate (its conjugate base).\n\n*   **Determine the volume of NaOH for equivalence:** First, we find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to completely neutralize the 0.001 mol of acetic acid.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH at 25% titration:** 25% of 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³\n\n*   **Calculate moles reacted and remaining:**\n    Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 mol/L * 0.00250 L = 0.00025 mol\n    This reacts with 0.00025 mol of CH₃COOH to form 0.00025 mol of acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n    Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 0.00025 mol\n\n*   **Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:** For a buffer solution, the pH is calculated using this equation.\n    pH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])\n    Where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the acid (acetic acid). Since they are in the same volume, the ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles.\n\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    pH = 4.73 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\n    pH = 4.73 + log (1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### 4. pH at the Equivalence Point\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The solution now contains 0.001 mol of CH₃COO⁻.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume:**\n    Total Volume = Initial volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion:**\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.02 M**\n\n*   **Hydrolysis of the acetate ion:** The acetate ion is a weak base and will react with water (hydrolysis) to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution basic.\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\n*   **Calculate Kb:** The base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate can be found from the acid dissociation constant (Ka) of acetic acid and the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴).\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration:** We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction.\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Assuming 'x' is very small compared to 0.02, we can simplify:\n    x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48\n    **pH ≈ 8.52**\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated pH values are:\n*   At 25% titration: **4.26**\n*   At the equivalence point: **8.52**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
