    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first identify the starting material and the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. The Reactant\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\nLet's determine its molecular formula:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A 6-carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. Let's place it at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group at position C5.\n\nCounting the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 in the carboxyl group + 1 in the formyl group + 2 in the vinyl group = **10 carbons**.\n*   **Oxygens (O)**: 2 in the carboxyl group + 1 in the formyl group = **3 oxygens**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H)**: After accounting for all the bonds to carbon and other groups, we can count the hydrogens. The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant can be calculated as:\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1  (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to one ring, three double bonds (one in the ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the formyl group), and the C=O of the carboxylic acid (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5).\n\n### 2. The Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess hydroiodic acid (Red P + HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce various functional groups to alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\n### 3. The Product\nThe reaction will reduce all the functional groups and unsaturation in the starting material:\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** at C1 is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** at C2 is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **vinyl group** at C5 is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The **double bond** within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n\nThe original C10 carbon skeleton remains, but it becomes fully saturated. The product is **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\nLet's find the molecular formula for the product:\n*   **Carbons (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 from the first methyl group + 1 from the second methyl group + 2 from the ethyl group = **10 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H)**: The general formula for a saturated cycloalkane is CnH2n. For C10, this would be C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as degrees of unsaturation) indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\nThe IHD can be calculated using the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = C - (H/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD by inspecting the structure of the product, **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**. The structure contains:\n*   **One ring**.\n*   **Zero double or triple bonds**.\n\nEach ring or double bond contributes one to the IHD. Therefore, the IHD of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
