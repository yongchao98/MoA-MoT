    "To determine the minimum resolution needed, we must first calculate the characteristic distance the particle travels before it decays in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass (m₀).\n    γ = E / m₀\n    Given E = 27 GeV and m₀ = 3.41 GeV.\n    γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918\n\n2.  **Calculate the particle's velocity (β = v/c):**\n    The relationship between energy, momentum (p), and mass is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)². From this, we can find the momentum.\n    pc = √(E² - (m₀c²)²) = √(27² - 3.41²) ≈ 26.78 GeV\n    The velocity relative to the speed of light is given by β = pc / E.\n    β = 26.78 GeV / 27 GeV ≈ 0.992\n    The particle is traveling at approximately 99.2% of the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L):**\n    The proper lifetime (τ₀) is the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame. In the lab frame, this lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor, and the distance it travels is called the mean decay length (L).\n    L = γ * β * c * τ₀\n    L ≈ 7.918 * 0.992 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n    L ≈ 1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n4.  **Interpret \"Minimum Resolution to Observe at least 30% of Decays\":**\n    A detector's resolution is the smallest distance it can measure. To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution. If it decays at a shorter distance, the decay point is indistinguishable from the production point.\n\n    We need to find the resolution `x` such that at least 30% of particles travel a distance greater than `x`. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `d` or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law P(d ≥ x) = e^(-x/L).\n\n    We set this probability to 0.30:\n    e^(-x/L) = 0.30\n\n    To solve for x, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    -x / L = ln(0.30)\n    x = -L * ln(0.30)\n    x ≈ -(1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\n    x ≈ 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n    Alternatively, another interpretation is that the required resolution is on the order of the mean decay length itself. At one mean decay length (x=L), the fraction of observed decays would be e⁻¹ ≈ 0.368, or about 37%, which satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition. Under this interpretation, the required resolution would be L ≈ 1.89 x 10⁻⁶ m.\n\n    Both calculated values (1.89 x 10⁻⁶ m and 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m) are very close to option D. The minor discrepancy between the calculated values and the provided option is likely due to small rounding in the problem's given parameters. Option D is the only one in the correct physical range.\n\n    If we assume the intended answer is D and work backward, it corresponds to a mean decay length `L` such that `2.08e-6 = -L * ln(0.30)`, which gives `L = 1.73e-6 m`. Or, it corresponds to a mean decay length of `L=2.08e-6 m`, which would occur if the proper lifetime was `8.8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s`. Given the options, 2.08*1e-6 m is the only plausible choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
