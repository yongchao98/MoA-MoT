    "Based on the initial analysis and the search results, here is a breakdown of each compound's potential for optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    This compound is a biphenyl derivative. Biphenyls can exhibit a form of optical isomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This typically happens when there are large, bulky groups in the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These bulky groups cause significant steric hindrance, preventing the two rings from freely rotating and becoming coplanar. This restricted rotation leads to a chiral axis, and the molecule can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), making it optically active.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (at the 2-position) bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active, existing as a pair of enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:**\n    Benzophenone has a central carbonyl carbon double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Because the two phenyl groups are identical, there are no chiral centers in the molecule. Although individual molecules can adopt a twisted, non-planar conformation, they can freely interconvert with their mirror image at room temperature, making the compound achiral and optically inactive as a whole. While some heavily substituted benzophenone derivatives can be resolved, and achiral benzophenone can form chiral crystals, the isolated molecule itself is not optically active.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    Dimethyl fumarate is the trans-isomer of a butenedioic acid ester. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it is not optically active. While it is a stereoisomer (a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not an optical isomer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate shows optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.\n*   Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.\n*   Benzophenone and dimethyl fumarate do not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the moieties that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
