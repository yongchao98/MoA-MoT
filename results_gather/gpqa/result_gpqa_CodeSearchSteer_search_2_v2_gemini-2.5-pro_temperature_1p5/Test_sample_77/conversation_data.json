    "The scalar and vector potentials, V and A respectively, for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and describe the complete, relativistically correct electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe derivation accounts for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. This means the field observed at position `\\vec{r}` and time `t` was generated by the charge `q` at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`. The key is to evaluate the position and velocity of the charge at this retarded time.\n\nThe standard expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**  `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]`\n*   **Vector Potential (\\vec{A}):** `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]`\n\nIn these formulas, all quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. The denominator can be rewritten as `(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}) / c`.\n\nBy substituting this into the expressions, we get:\n*   `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}`\n*   `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}`\n\nComparing these derived formulas with the given options, we find that they match option A. Option B uses the incorrect static potential, and option D has an incorrect sign in the denominator. It's also worth noting that for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the vector potential is related to the scalar potential by `\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2) V`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
