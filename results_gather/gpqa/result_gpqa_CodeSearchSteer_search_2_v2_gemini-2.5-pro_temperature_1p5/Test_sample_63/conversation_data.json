    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Products of the Decomposition\n\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated, forming only a mixture of gases. This gas mixture was passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Copper reacts with oxygen to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   This means 0.80 g of oxygen atoms (O) were in the gas mixture.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as a diatomic molecule (O₂) in the gas, the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After the other components were removed, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n### 2. Identify Gas C\n\nWe can determine the molar mass of Gas C using the law of conservation of mass. The initial mass of the salts (7.20 g) must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol is most likely nitrogen gas (N₂), which has a molar mass of 28.02 g/mol. Nitrogen is also inert under the conditions in the tubes, which is consistent with the observations.\n\n### 3. Determine the Empirical Formula of the Salts\n\nThe original salts A and B decomposed into 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂. From this, we can find the total amount of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = (0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To convert this to a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**.\n\n### 4. Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe salts are in an equimolar mixture. This means for every mole of salt A, there is one mole of salt B. The combined empirical formula of one unit of A plus one unit of B is N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   The presence of 8 hydrogen atoms suggests the presence of two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), as 2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n*   If we assign two NH₄⁺ ions, the remaining atoms for the two anions are N₄₋₂O₅, or N₂O₅.\n*   We need to split the N₂O₅ composition into two separate, common anions. The most logical split is into a nitrate ion (NO₃⁻) and a nitrite ion (NO₂⁻).\n\nThis leads to the identification of the two salts:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions. At elevated temperatures, ammonium nitrite decomposes to nitrogen and water:\nNH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nThe decomposition of ammonium nitrate typically yields N₂O and H₂O. However, at higher temperatures or in the presence of other substances, it can decompose completely to nitrogen, oxygen, and water, which matches the observed products.\n2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O, or per mole: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nThis combination of salts and their decomposition pathways perfectly matches all the quantitative data from the experiment.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 (in A) + 9 (in B) = 17 atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
