    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), and how they interact with the functional groups present in the proposed starting materials.\n\nThe proposed starting materials are all stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-COO-isobutyl) at the other. The product in both reactions is a δ-lactone (a six-membered cyclic ester), formed by the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups to an alcohol, followed by intramolecular cyclization. The stereocenter at the C4 position (bearing the ethyl group) of the lactone corresponds to the C3 position in the starting material. Crucially, this chiral center is not directly involved in the reduction or cyclization reactions, so its stereochemistry is expected to be retained from the starting material to the product.\n\n#### Reaction A: Starting Material A + LiBH₄ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It is known to reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. While it can reduce carboxylic acids, the reaction is much slower compared to the reduction of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** In this reaction, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group will remain largely unreacted. The resulting intermediate is (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Cyclization:** Following the reduction, an acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl at C1, forming the stable six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the stereocenter is retained, to obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Starting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n#### Reaction B: Starting Material B + BH₃ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Borane (BH₃), typically used as a complex with THF or dimethyl sulfide, is a strong reducing agent that shows high selectivity for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, even in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will preferentially reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact. The intermediate formed is isobutyl (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Cyclization:** The acid workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed primary alcohol at one end of the molecule attacks the ester carbonyl at the other end, displacing isobutanol to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center is preserved during this process. Therefore, to form the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nBased on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
