    "### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\nThe problem describes two sequential reactions starting from geometric isomers of oct-4-ene. Let's analyze each reaction step-by-step to determine the final products.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. The epoxidation of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. A *trans*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the product will be a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-diethyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-diethyloxirane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The epoxide ring is then opened by treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, which occurs via an Sₙ2-like mechanism with *anti*-addition. The water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n    *   Opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (which is identical to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol).\n    This product has two stereocenters but possesses a plane of symmetry, making it a single, achiral *meso* compound.\n\n**Product of Reaction 1:** (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a *meso* compound).\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene. *Syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene produces a *cis*-epoxide. Since (Z)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene, the resulting epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-diethyloxirane, is a *meso* compound.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The *meso*-epoxide undergoes acid-catalyzed ring opening, which is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon (e.g., C4, which is R) inverts its configuration to S, leaving the other (C5, which is S) unchanged. This forms (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon (C5, which is S) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. This forms (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n\n**Products of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis of the Combined Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the single *meso* product from Reaction 1 with the racemic mixture from Reaction 2. The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*meso*)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (*enantiomer A*)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*enantiomer B*)\n\nThe relationship between the *meso* compound and each of the enantiomers is that of diastereomers.\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, such as the *meso* compound and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties and will be separated by the column.\nTherefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the *meso* compound and a second for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers.\n*   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The *meso* compound is a diastereomer of the other two and is achiral. It will also be separated from them and will appear as its own distinct peak.\nTherefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers, resulting in **three peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>"
