    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement. This type of reaction is common for 1,5-dienes and proceeds through a concerted, cyclic transition state involving six electrons.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify the starting material:** The initial molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Its structure is:\n    CH₃–CH=CH–CH₂–CH(C₄H₉)–CH=CH–CH₂–CH₃\n\n2.  **Locate the 1,5-diene system:** The two double bonds are between carbons 2-3 and 6-7. These are separated by a single bond between carbons 4 and 5. This C2=C3–C4–C5–C6=C7 arrangement constitutes the 1,5-diene system that will rearrange.\n\n3.  **Determine the bond changes:** In a Cope rearrangement, a sigma (σ) bond is broken, and a new one is formed, while the double (π) bonds shift position.\n    *   **Bond cleavage:** The C4–C5 single bond breaks.\n    *   **Bond formation:** A new C2–C7 single bond is formed.\n    *   **Pi bond migration:** The double bond at C2=C3 moves to C3=C4, and the double bond at C6=C7 moves to C5=C6.\n\n4.  **Construct the product:** By reassembling the molecular fragments according to the bond changes, the following structure is formed:\n    CH₂=CH–CH(CH₃)–CH(CH₂CH₃)–CH=CH(C₄H₉)\n\n5.  **Name the product:** To determine the correct IUPAC name, we must find the longest carbon chain that includes both double bonds.\n    *   The longest chain in the product molecule contains ten carbon atoms.\n    *   Numbering this chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants results in the double bonds starting at carbon 1 and carbon 5.\n    *   The substituents on this chain are a methyl group at carbon 3 and an ethyl group at carbon 4.\n\nTherefore, the systematic name of the product is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n*   B) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n*   C) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n*   D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene (duplicate of C)\n\nThe correct product matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
