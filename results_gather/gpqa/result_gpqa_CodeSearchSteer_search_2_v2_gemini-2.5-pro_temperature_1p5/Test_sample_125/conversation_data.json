    "To determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms, a detailed analysis of the products from each reaction and the principles of the separation techniques is necessary.\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products:** The attack of the hydride ion can occur from either face of the planar ketone, resulting in two possible stereoisomers. Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged, the products are diastereomers:\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBHâ‚„), which reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a *meso* compound (2R, 4S), which is identical to (2S, 4R) due to an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, Reaction II yields three distinct stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S))\n\nThe (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers and are produced as a racemic mixture. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the combined mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their polarity.\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, and can therefore be separated on a normal-phase column. This will result in **two peaks**.\n*   For the products of Reaction II, the meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol). As diastereomers, they have different polarities and will be separated, giving **two peaks**. The enantiomers within the pair, however, have identical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different molecules (C7H16O2 vs. C5H12O2) and will have sufficiently different polarities to be resolved from each other.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be the sum of the separable components: 2 peaks from Reaction I + 2 peaks from Reaction II = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) to separate stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   The mixture contains five chemically distinct stereoisomers.\n*   A chiral column can resolve all of these isomers because each one will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.\n*   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II (the meso compound and the two enantiomers) will also be separated from each other.\n*   Assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of the two different reactions, all five stereoisomers will be resolved.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis predicts **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** and **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
