    "The key to solving this problem lies in the conservation of the z-component of the total angular momentum.\n\nThe initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled representation as `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. In this state:\n*   `l` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n*   `m` is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum (`L_z`).\n\nA fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that a measurement of an observable on a system in an eigenstate of that observable will always yield the corresponding eigenvalue. Here, the system is in an eigenstate of the total angular momentum z-component operator, `L_z = L_1z + L_2z`, with the eigenvalue `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of `L_1z` and `L_2z` to both be `-ħ`. This corresponds to finding the individual quantum numbers `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n\nIf this measurement outcome were to occur, the z-component of the total angular momentum of the system would be the sum of the individual components:\n`m = m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\nThis creates a contradiction. The initial state has a definite total angular momentum z-component corresponding to `m = -1`. The measurement outcome being considered corresponds to a total angular momentum z-component of `m = -2`. Since the z-component of angular momentum must be conserved during the measurement process, it is impossible to start in a state with `m=-1` and find the system in a state with `m=-2`.\n\nAnother way to see this is by using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coupled state `|l, m>` can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states `|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>`. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are the coefficients of this expansion. A crucial selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if `m = m_1 + m_2`.\n\nWe are looking for the probability of finding the system in the state `|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1>`. This probability is the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>`, which is `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>`.\n\nSince `m_1 + m_2 = -2` and `m = -1`, the condition `m = m_1 + m_2` is not met. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
