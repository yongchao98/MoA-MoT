    "An N-sided polygon with equal apothems of length 'a' will approach a circle of radius 'a' as N approaches infinity. The diffraction of monochromatic light through a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern.\n\nThe angular positions of the minima in an Airy diffraction pattern are given by the formula:\n\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = m * λ / D\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n*   m is a coefficient corresponding to the zeros of the first-order Bessel function.\n\nIn this problem, the radius of the circular aperture is the apothem 'a', so the diameter D = 2a.\n\nThe angular positions for the first and second minima are determined by the first and second zeros of the first-order Bessel function (J₁). The values for the first few minima are:\n*   First minimum (θ₁): The coefficient m₁ is approximately 1.22.\n*   Second minimum (θ₂): The coefficient m₂ is approximately 2.23.\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions:\n*   Angular position of the first minimum:\n    θ₁ = 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a.\n*   Angular position of the second minimum:\n    θ₂ = 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a.\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between θ₂ and θ₁:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.115 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.505 * λ / a\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option A. The slight difference is due to using more precise values for the zeros of the Bessel function. A more precise value for the first zero is 1.21967 and for the second is 2.23313.\n\nUsing these more precise values:\n*   θ₁ = 1.21967 * λ / (2a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\n*   θ₂ = 2.23313 * λ / (2a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a\n*   Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a = 0.5068 * λ / a\n\nThis result strongly corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
