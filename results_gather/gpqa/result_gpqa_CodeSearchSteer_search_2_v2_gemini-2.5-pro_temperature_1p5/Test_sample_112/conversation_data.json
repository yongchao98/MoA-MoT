    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness distinguishes it from the sharper O-H peak of an alcohol.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration (1690-1760 cm⁻¹). The presence of both this C=O peak and the broad O-H peak is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which typically appears between 1620-1680 cm⁻¹.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Vinyl-hydrogens:** The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond and typically resonate in the δ 4.5-7 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺. The detection of this fragment strongly corroborates the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**4. Degree of Unsaturation**\n\nThe combined spectral data indicate the presence of both a carboxylic acid group (which contains one C=O double bond) and a separate C=C double bond. Each double bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for each of the given options using the formula:\nDoU = C - (H/2) + 1\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This formula only allows for one double bond or ring, which is insufficient.\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This could represent a saturated carboxylic acid, but it cannot also contain the C=C bond indicated by the NMR and FTIR data.\n*   **C) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This formula has the correct degrees of unsaturation, but only one oxygen atom, which contradicts the strong evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This formula perfectly matches the evidence. It has two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and two degrees of unsaturation, accounting for both the C=O in the acid and the C=C in the carbon chain.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound has a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecular formula must contain two oxygen atoms and have two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula **C6H10O2** satisfies all these conditions. The compound is likely a hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
