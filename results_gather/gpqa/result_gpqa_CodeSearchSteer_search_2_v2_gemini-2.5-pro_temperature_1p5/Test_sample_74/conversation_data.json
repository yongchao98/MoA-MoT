  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine the cause of the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed in the context of molecular translation.\n\nThe analysis of the construct's sequence is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `5'-ATG...`, which is the standard start codon that codes for Methionine (Met). This indicates that the translation process should initiate correctly.\n\n2.  **Analyze the HA Tag Sequence:** The influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag is located at the N-terminus, immediately following the start codon. The standard amino acid sequence for an HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Translating the DNA sequence provided:\n    *   `ATG` (Met - Start)\n    *   `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC` corresponds to `Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A`.\n    *   This confirms that the HA tag sequence itself is correct and does not contain a missense mutation. Therefore, option (C) is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Scan for In-frame Codons:** Reading the DNA sequence in triplicate (in codons) from the start codon is crucial.\n    *   **HA-Tag:** `ATG (TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC)`\n    *   **Sequence immediately after the tag:** `...AAATGA...`\n    *   Breaking this down into codons in the same reading frame: `AAA TGA`\n\n4.  **Identify the Stop Codon:** In the genetic code, there are three stop codons that signal the termination of translation: UAA, UAG, and UGA in mRNA, which correspond to TAA, TAG, and TGA on the coding DNA strand.\n    *   The codon `TGA` identified immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and one additional codon (AAA for Lysine) is a premature stop codon (also known as a nonsense codon).\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the options:**\n    *   A) The lack of a linker sequence is not the primary issue. While linkers can be beneficial, the presence of a premature stop codon prevents the synthesis of the full-length protein in the first place.\n    *   B) This statement is biologically incorrect. tRNAs do not exist for stop codons; instead, release factors recognize these codons and terminate translation. Furthermore, the relevant codon here is TGA, not TAA.\n    *   C) The HA tag sequence is correct.\n    *   D) The presence of the premature `TGA` stop codon causes the ribosome to detach from the mRNA, terminating translation shortly after it began. This results in the production of only a tiny peptide fragment (Met-HA-Lys) and prevents the expression of the full-length GADD45G protein, which perfectly explains the experimental observation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
