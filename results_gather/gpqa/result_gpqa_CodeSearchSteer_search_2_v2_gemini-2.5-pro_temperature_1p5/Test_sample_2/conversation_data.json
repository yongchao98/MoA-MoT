    "To find the expectation value of the operator `10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x}`, we first need to determine the expectation values of `\\sigma{z}` and `\\sigma_{x}` separately for the given spin state.\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is a linear superposition given by:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩`\n\nIn the standard z-basis, the spin-up state `|↑⟩` is represented by the vector `[1, 0]` and the spin-down state `|↓⟩` is represented by `[0, 1]`. Therefore, the state vector `|ψ⟩` is:\n`|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\nThe Pauli matrices for the spin operators `\\sigma_{z}` and `\\sigma_{x}` are defined as follows.\n\n`\\sigma_{z} = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n`\\sigma_{x} = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `Â` for a state `|ψ⟩` is calculated as `⟨ψ|Â|ψ⟩`.\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of `\\sigma_{z}` (`⟨\\sigma_{z}⟩`):**\n\n`⟨\\sigma_{z}⟩ = ⟨ψ|\\sigma_{z}|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n`= [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2]^T`\n`= (0.5 * 0.5) + (√3/2 * -√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of `\\sigma_{x}` (`⟨\\sigma_{x}⟩`):**\n\n`⟨\\sigma_{x}⟩ = ⟨ψ|\\sigma_{x}|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n`= [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]^T`\n`= (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value of the combined operator `10\\sigma_{z}+5\\sigma_{x}`:**\n\nThe expectation value is linear, so we can write:\n`⟨10\\sigma_{z}+5\\sigma_{x}⟩ = 10 * ⟨\\sigma_{z}⟩ + 5 * ⟨\\sigma_{x}⟩`\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n`= 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`= -5 + (5 * √3) / 2`\n\nUsing the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`= -5 + (5 * 1.732) / 2`\n`= -5 + 8.66 / 2`\n`= -5 + 4.33`\n`= -0.67`\n\nRounding the result to one decimal place gives -0.7.\n\n<<<C>>>"
