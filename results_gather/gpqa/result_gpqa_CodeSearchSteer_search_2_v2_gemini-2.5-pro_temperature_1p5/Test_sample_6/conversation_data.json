    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to determine the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays is limited by their annihilation with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons.\n\n### Understanding the Process\n\nThe interaction in question is the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray (γ) with a low-energy photon from the CMB, resulting in the creation of an electron-positron pair (e⁺e⁻). The reaction is represented as:\n`γγ → e⁺e⁻`\n\nFor this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the two particles being created, the electron and the positron.\n\n### Key Physical Principles\n\n1.  **Threshold Energy:** The minimum energy required for a reaction to happen is called the threshold energy. In this case, it's when the electron and positron are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame.\n2.  **Lorentz Invariance:** The quantity `E² - (pc)²`, where E is energy and p is momentum, is a constant value across all inertial reference frames. This is the square of the rest mass energy.\n3.  **Collision Condition:** To find the minimum energy of the incoming gamma-ray, we must consider the most efficient collision, which is a head-on collision.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Energy in the Center-of-Mass Frame:**\n    The minimum energy required to create an electron-positron pair is the sum of their rest mass energies. The rest mass energy of an electron (mₑc²) is approximately 0.511 MeV. Since a positron has the same mass, the total rest mass energy required is:\n    `E_cm = 2 * mₑc² = 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV`\n\n2.  **Applying Lorentz Invariance:**\n    The square of the total four-momentum must be the same in the lab frame (the universe) and the center-of-mass frame. For two photons, the invariant mass squared `s` is given by:\n    `s = 2 * E_γ * E_cmb * (1 - cosθ)`\n    Where:\n    *   `E_γ` is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n    *   `E_cmb` is the energy of the CMB photon.\n    *   `θ` is the angle between the paths of the two photons.\n\n    To find the threshold energy for `E_γ`, we need to maximize the `(1 - cosθ)` term. This occurs in a head-on collision, where `θ = π` (180 degrees), making `cosθ = -1`. The term thus becomes `(1 - (-1)) = 2`.\n\n    At the threshold, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame (`√s`) is `2mₑc²`. Therefore:\n    `s = (2mₑc²)² = 4(mₑc²)²`\n\n    Equating the two expressions for `s`:\n    `2 * E_γ * E_cmb * 2 = 4(mₑc²)²`\n    `4 * E_γ * E_cmb = 4(mₑc²)²`\n    `E_γ * E_cmb = (mₑc²)²`\n\n    This gives us the formula for the threshold energy of the gamma-ray:\n    `E_γ = (mₑc²)² / E_cmb`\n\n3.  **Plugging in the Values:**\n    We are given:\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, `E_cmb = 10⁻³ eV`.\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron, `mₑc² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 * 10⁶ eV`.\n\n    Now, we calculate `E_γ`:\n    `E_γ = (0.511 * 10⁶ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)`\n    `E_γ = (0.2611 * 10¹² eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)`\n    `E_γ = 0.2611 * 10¹⁵ eV`\n    `E_γ = 2.611 * 10¹⁴ eV`\n\n4.  **Converting to Giga-electron Volts (GeV):**\n    Since 1 GeV = 10⁹ eV:\n    `E_γ = (2.611 * 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)`\n    `E_γ = 2.611 * 10⁵ GeV`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated threshold energy is approximately `2.6 * 10⁵ GeV`. This value closely matches option C. Above this energy, the probability of pair production increases, significantly limiting the distance a gamma-ray can travel through the universe before being annihilated. Search results confirm that very high-energy gamma rays are indeed attenuated by interactions with background photons like the CMB, and this process becomes significant in the PeV range (1 PeV = 10⁶ GeV), which is consistent with our calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
