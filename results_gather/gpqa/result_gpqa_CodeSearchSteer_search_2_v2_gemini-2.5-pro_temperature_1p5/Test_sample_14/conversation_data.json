    "The final step is to calculate the ratio of the transit probabilities. My initial derivation of the formulas and the subsequent calculation seem correct.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability (P_t):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its host star is approximately the ratio of the star's radius (R_s) to the planet's semi-major axis (a). This is confirmed by multiple sources.\n    *   P_t ≈ R_s / a\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The relationship between the orbital period (P), semi-major axis (a), and the mass of the host star (M_s) is given by Kepler's Third Law. The general form shows that P² is proportional to a³ / M_s. This can be rearranged to show that a³ is proportional to P² * M_s.\n    *   a ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)\n\nBased on this, my step-by-step derivation is sound.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   P₂ = 3 * P₁\n*   Mₛ₁ = 2 * Mₛ₂\n*   Rₛ₁ = Rₛ₂\n\n**Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₁/a₂):**\nUsing Kepler's Third Law:\n(a₁/a₂)³ = (P₁/P₂)² * (Mₛ₁/Mₛ₂)\n(a₁/a₂)³ = (1/3)² * (2/1)\n(a₁/a₂)³ = (1/9) * 2\n(a₁/a₂)³ = 2/9\na₁/a₂ = (2/9)^(1/3)\n\n**Ratio of Transit Probabilities (P_t1 / P_t2):**\nP_t1 / P_t2 = (Rₛ₁ / a₁) / (Rₛ₂ / a₂)\nSince Rₛ₁ = Rₛ₂, the radii cancel out:\nP_t1 / P_t2 = a₂ / a₁\nP_t1 / P_t2 = 1 / (a₁/a₂)\nP_t1 / P_t2 = 1 / [(2/9)^(1/3)]\nP_t1 / P_t2 = (9/2)^(1/3)\nP_t1 / P_t2 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n**Calculation:**\n(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096...\n\nThis means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. This aligns perfectly with option C.\n\nFinal check of reasoning:\n*   Planet_1 has a much shorter period (3 times shorter), which brings it closer to its star, increasing transit probability.\n*   Planet_1 orbits a more massive star (2 times more massive), which for a given period, would push it further out, decreasing transit probability.\n*   The calculation shows that the effect of the shorter period is stronger than the effect of the more massive star, leading to a net increase in transit probability for Planet_1. The calculation of ~1.65 times higher probability is robust based on the provided information and established physics.\n\nTherefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target.\n\n<<<C>>>"
