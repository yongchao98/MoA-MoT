    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star 1 is greater than that of Star 2, we can use the principles of black-body radiation.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is related to its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law states that the wavelength at which a black body is brightest (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Temperature Comparison:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the two stars appear brightest are the same (λ_max,1 = λ_max,2). According to Wien's Displacement Law, since λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature, if the peak wavelengths are identical, their surface temperatures must also be identical (T1 = T2).\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** To find the ratio of the luminosities (L1 / L2), we can set up a ratio using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law for each star.\n    *   L1 = 4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴\n    *   L2 = 4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴\n\n    By dividing the first equation by the second, the constants (4, π, and σ) cancel out:\n    L1 / L2 = [(R1)²(T1)⁴] / [(R2)²(T2)⁴]\n\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴\n\n3.  **Substituting Known Values:**\n    *   From the problem, we know that the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2, so R1 / R2 = 1.5.\n    *   From our analysis using Wien's Law, we know the temperatures are equal, so T1 / T2 = 1.\n\n    Substituting these values into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 * 1\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25\n\nThe information regarding the stars' masses and radial velocities is not relevant to this specific calculation, which is based on the assumption that the stars radiate as black bodies.\n\nThe luminosity of Star 1 is greater than the luminosity of Star 2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<D>>>"
