    "The validity of the Mott-Gurney equation rests on several key assumptions about the semiconductor device and the nature of charge transport within it. Analyzing these assumptions allows for a clear determination of the correct statement.\n\nThe fundamental principles underlying the Mott-Gurney law include:\n*   **Single-Carrier Transport**: The model assumes that the current is carried by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes.\n*   **Trap-Free Material**: The derivation presumes an ideal semiconductor or insulator with no trapping states within the band gap that could capture the injected charge carriers. The presence of traps would alter the voltage dependence of the current.\n*   **Ohmic Contacts**: The equation is valid for devices with Ohmic contacts, which means there is no energy barrier for the injection of charge carriers from the electrodes into the material. This is often described as having a zero electric field at the injecting electrode or no carrier injection barrier.\n*   **Drift-Dominated Current**: The model assumes that the current is primarily due to the drift of carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The contribution from diffusion current, which arises from carrier concentration gradients, is considered negligible.\n\nEvaluating the given options based on these principles:\n\n**A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law is specifically formulated for a single-carrier device.\n\n**B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\nThis is incorrect. The Mott-Gurney equation describes a drift-dominated current; therefore, the drift current is the primary component and cannot be negligible.\n\n**C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\nThis statement accurately reflects the main assumptions of the Mott-Gurney law: it applies to a single-carrier system, in a trap-free medium, with an ideal injecting contact (no injection barrier), where the current is dominated by drift (negligible diffusion).\n\n**D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\nThis is incorrect. A Schottky contact is characterized by an energy barrier, which violates the assumption of an ideal, barrier-free Ohmic contact required for the Mott-Gurney law to be valid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
