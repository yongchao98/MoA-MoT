    "### Analysis of Spectral Data to Identify Unnamed Compound\n\nBased on the provided spectral information, a step-by-step analysis leads to the identification of the unknown white solid.\n\n#### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)\nThe mass spectrum provides crucial information about the molecular weight and elemental composition of the compound.\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** A peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound, containing the most abundant isotopes, is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** A peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32% suggests the presence of a chlorine atom. Chlorine has two common isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with natural abundances of approximately 75% and 25%, respectively. This leads to an M+ to M+2 peak ratio of about 3:1, which matches the observed 100% to 32% ratio.\n\nCalculating the molecular weights of the options with ³⁵Cl:\n*   **Phenyl chloroformate (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂):** 156.56 g/mol.\n*   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂):** 156.57 g/mol.\n*   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂):** 156.57 g/mol.\n*   **3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂):** 156.57 g/mol.\n\nAll four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n#### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy\nThe IR spectrum reveals the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded, typically as a dimer.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n\nThis information strongly points to the presence of an aromatic carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This allows us to eliminate phenyl chloroformate (A), which lacks the -OH group, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D), which has an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group, but not a carboxylic acid. Both 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B) and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) are consistent with this data.\n\n#### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides detailed information about the structure and chemical environment of the hydrogen atoms.\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal, far downfield, is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration as a single proton confirms this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm) indicate four protons on a benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. This symmetry results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm).\n\n#### Conclusion\nEvaluating the remaining options based on the ¹H NMR data:\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a *para*-substitution pattern, which would produce the observed two doublets for two protons each in the aromatic region. This structure is consistent with all three pieces of spectral data.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has an *ortho*-substitution pattern. This would result in a more complex splitting pattern with four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\nTherefore, the only structure that fits all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
