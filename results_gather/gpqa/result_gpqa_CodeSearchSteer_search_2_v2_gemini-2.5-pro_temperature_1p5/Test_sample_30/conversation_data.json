    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\nThis is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The mixture of concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing activator. The major product, due to less steric hindrance, is *p-nitrotoluene* (1).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (*p*-nitrotoluene) is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of the methyl group. Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) is an oxidizing agent, though alternatives like potassium permanganate are more common for converting alkylbenzenes to carboxylic acids. However, for the subsequent reaction to be a standard named reaction, the oxidation of the methyl group to an aldehyde is the most logical interpretation. This would form *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde (2). The use of MnO₂ can, under controlled conditions, yield an aldehyde from a methyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (*p*-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\nThis set of reagents is characteristic of a crossed aldol condensation, specifically the Claisen-Schmidt condensation, because it involves an aldehyde without α-hydrogens (*p*-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone with α-hydrogens (acetone) in the presence of a base (NaOH). The base removes an α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting aldol adduct readily dehydrates to form a stable, conjugated system. The final product (3) is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n**Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group, we analyze the structure of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   The molecule has a backbone consisting of a p-nitrophenyl group linked to a propenone chain (-CH=CH-C(O)CH₃).\n*   The double bond is in the more stable *trans* (E) configuration.\n*   The molecule as a whole is largely planar. This molecular plane contains the benzene ring, the C=C double bond, and the carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   The molecule does **not** possess any rotational axes (Cₙ where n>1) or a center of inversion (i).\n*   The molecule **does** possess a single plane of symmetry (σ), which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n\nA molecule that only has an identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
