    "To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we need to calculate the energy it gains during each revolution and divide the total final energy by this value.\n\n### Key Principles\n\nA synchrocyclotron is a particle accelerator that uses a constant magnetic field but varies the frequency of the accelerating electric field to account for relativistic effects as the particle's speed increases. Particles are accelerated in pulses, and for stable acceleration, they must cross the accelerating gap at a specific, constant phase known as the synchronous phase (Φs). This ensures they consistently gain energy. The energy gained per gap crossing is given by the formula ΔE = q * U₀ * cos(Φs), where q is the particle's charge, U₀ is the peak voltage, and Φs is the synchronous phase. A proton crosses the accelerating gap twice per revolution, so the total energy gain per revolution is double this amount.\n\n### Given Data\n\n*   **Final Kinetic Energy (T₁):** 950 MeV\n*   **Initial Kinetic Energy (T):**  ~0 MeV\n*   **Peak Voltage (U₀):** 190 kV = 190,000 V\n*   **Proton Charge (q):** 1 elementary charge (e)\n*   **Synchronous Phase (Φ₀):** π/4\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Energy Gain per Revolution:**\n    The energy gained each time the proton crosses the accelerating gap is determined by the voltage at the synchronous phase.\n    *   Energy gain per crossing = `q * U₀ * cos(Φ₀)`\n    *   Since the proton is a single-charge particle (q=1e) and the voltage is given in volts, the energy gain can be expressed in electron-volts (eV).\n    *   Energy gain per crossing = `1 * (190,000 V) * cos(π/4) = 190,000 * (1/√2) eV ≈ 134,350 eV`\n\n    The proton is accelerated twice per revolution, so the total energy gain per revolution (ΔT_rev) is:\n    *   `ΔT_rev = 2 * 190,000 * cos(π/4) eV = 380,000 * (1/√2) eV ≈ 268,700 eV`\n    *   `ΔT_rev ≈ 268.7 keV`\n\n2.  **Total Number of Revolutions:**\n    The total number of revolutions (N) is the final kinetic energy divided by the energy gained per revolution.\n    *   `N = Total Energy / Energy per Revolution`\n    *   `N = T₁ / ΔT_rev`\n\n    First, ensure the energy units are consistent. Let's use MeV:\n    *   `T₁ = 950 MeV`\n    *   `ΔT_rev = 380,000 * cos(π/4) eV = 0.380 * cos(π/4) MeV`\n\n    Now, calculate N:\n    *   `N = 950 / (0.380 * cos(π/4))`\n    *   `N = 950 / (0.380 * 0.7071)`\n    *   `N = 950 / 0.2687`\n    *   `N ≈ 3535.5`\n\n    This can also be calculated as:\n    *   `N = (950 * 10⁶) / (380 * 10³ * (1/√2))`\n    *   `N = (950 * 1000 * √2) / 380`\n    *   `N = 2500 * √2 ≈ 3535.5`\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated number of revolutions is approximately 3535.5. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n    *   A) 2500\n    *   B) 3536\n    *   C) 1864\n    *   D) 5300\n\n    The result is extremely close to 3536. The slight difference is negligible and likely due to rounding.\n\nThe correct answer is therefore **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
