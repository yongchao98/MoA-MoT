    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the choices.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four given structures are saturated alkanoic acids, consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises when a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **quartet**.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern occurs when a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet**.\n    *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet**.\n    *   Another, different group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second **triplet**.\n\nThe presence of both of these highly specific signals in the spectrum is the key to identifying the correct structure.\n\n### **3. Structural Analysis of the Options**\n\nWe must now examine the structure of each candidate molecule to determine if its protons would produce these specific splitting patterns. The condensed formulas provided are unconventional, so we must deduce the correct connectivity that results in a stable molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H), and the methyl group at C3 (3H). This would result in a **dtq**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton, a group of two protons, and another distinct group of two protons. Therefore, it would not produce a **dtt** signal.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** Interpreted as a linear chain (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid), this structure is impossible as it would require a carbon atom to have five bonds.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H), and the methyl group at C3 (3H). This would result in a **dtq**.\n    *   Similar to structure A, there is no proton environment that would lead to a **dtt** signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** The molecular formula for this compound is C₉H₁₈O₂. Although written unconventionally, this formula can represent **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**. Let's analyze its structure:\n    `HOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(b)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃`\n\n    *   **Proton at C4 (Hc):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C3 (Hb) (1H, **doublet**).\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ group of the hexanoic chain (2H, **triplet**).\n        *   The adjacent methyl (CH₃) group (3H, **quartet**).\n        *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n    *   **Proton at C3 (Hb):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C4 (Hc) (1H, **doublet**).\n        *   The adjacent CH₂(a) group next to the COOH (2H, **triplet**).\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H, **triplet**).\n        *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option C, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, possesses protons in the precise chemical environments required to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
