    "The initial analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's structure seems correct. The searches confirm that the reaction of a doubly-activated methylene compound like ethyl cyanoacetate with a dihalide such as 1,5-dibromopentane, in the presence of a strong base, leads to a cyclic product. Specifically, this is an intramolecular dialkylation.\n\nThe analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum for the resulting product, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane, also appears sound. The key is to correctly identify the chemical equivalence (or non-equivalence) of the protons in the molecule.\n\nLet's break down the analysis again, supported by the search results.\n\n1.  **Reaction Pathway:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Acetic acid undergoes alpha-bromination via the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction to form bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n    *   **Step 2:** Bromoacetic acid is esterified with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst (Fischer esterification) to yield ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Step 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate reacts with sodium cyanide in a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) to form ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃). This is a standard synthesis route for such compounds.\n    *   **Step 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane. Sodium hydride deprotonates the acidic α-carbon. The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess base then deprotonates the newly formed intermediate (which still has one acidic α-hydrogen), and the resulting carbanion performs an intramolecular SN2 reaction to close the ring, displacing the second bromine atom. This forms a 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane ring. The final product (4) is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane:**\n    To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must look at the molecule's symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the carbon with the cyano and ester groups) and C4 (the opposite carbon in the ring). This symmetry makes pairs of protons chemically equivalent.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and will produce one signal (a triplet). **(1 signal)**\n        *   **-OCH₂-:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic because they are related by the plane of symmetry in an achiral molecule. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent and give a single signal (a quartet). **(1 signal)**\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n        *   **C2/C6 Protons:** At C2, there is an axial proton (Hax) and an equatorial proton (Heq). These two protons are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts. The Hax on C2 is equivalent to the Hax on C6, and the Heq on C2 is equivalent to the Heq on C6 due to the plane of symmetry. Therefore, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **C3/C5 Protons:** Similarly, the axial and equatorial protons at C3 are diastereotopic. The protons at C3 are equivalent to their counterparts at C5. This results in two more distinct signals. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **C4 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons at C4 lie within the plane of symmetry but are not interchangeable. They are in different chemical environments (one axial, one equatorial) and are thus diastereotopic. This results in two distinct signals. **(2 signals)**\n\n    *   **Total Count:**\n        *   Ethyl -CH₃: 1\n        *   Ethyl -OCH₂-: 1\n        *   Ring C2/C6 (axial + equatorial): 2\n        *   Ring C3/C5 (axial + equatorial): 2\n        *   Ring C4 (axial + equatorial): 2\n        *   **Total Signals = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8**\n\nThere are 8 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
