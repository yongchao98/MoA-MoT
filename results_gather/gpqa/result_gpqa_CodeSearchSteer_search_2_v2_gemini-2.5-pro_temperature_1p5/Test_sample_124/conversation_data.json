    "The quantum mechanical system described is a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula $E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are the quantum numbers along the Cartesian axes, which can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe energy levels are as follows:\n*   **Ground state (n=0):** $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First excited state (n=1):** $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state (n=2):** $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state (n=3):** $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe value of the energy for the third excited state corresponds to n=3, which is $E_3 = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is known as the degeneracy of that level. The degeneracy, $g_n$, for the n-th energy level of a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula $g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we set n=3:\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$.\n\nThus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\nThis degeneracy can also be found by counting the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states\n*   The combination (1, 1, 1) — 1 state\nThe total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<D>>>"
