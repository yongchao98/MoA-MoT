    "This is a classic chemistry puzzle that requires identifying several unknown substances (A through H) based on a series of reactions. The key to solving this puzzle is to systematically deduce the identity of each substance using the provided clues.\n\n### Step-by-step Deduction:\n\n1.  **Reaction 3: Hydrolysis**: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`.\n    This is the most revealing clue. The fact that the non-A part of compound C hydrolyzes to produce two different acids (one strong, one weak) strongly suggests it contains at least two different non-metal elements. A classic example that fits this is a compound containing both chlorine and fluorine. Upon hydrolysis, these would form the strong acid HCl (F) and the weak acid HF (G). Another key part is that solid A is regenerated, which indicates it's likely an element that was oxidized to form C and is then reduced back by water.\n\n2.  **Reaction 4: Solvent Formation**: `D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent) [1:1 ratio]`.\n    Following the clue from the hydrolysis, if the system involves chlorine and fluorine, then B and D are likely fluorine (F₂) and chlorine (Cl₂) or compounds derived from them. A 1:1 reaction between two gases to form a solvent is specific. While a reaction between Cl₂ and F₂ gives ClF, a more compelling fit for the overall puzzle, especially considering B, is needed.\n    Let's re-examine B and D. Let's assume **B = ClF** (chlorine monofluoride, a gas) and **D = F₂** (fluorine, a gas). Their 1:1 reaction gives **H = ClF₃** (chlorine trifluoride). ClF₃ is a liquid at room temperature (b.p. 11.75 °C) and is used as a specialty solvent and a powerful fluorinating agent. This set of assignments is consistent.\n\n3.  **Reaction 1: Formation of C**: `A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red)`.\n    Substituting B = ClF, the reaction is `A(s) + 8 ClF(g) → C (bright red)`. This reaction consumes a large amount of the chlorofluorinating agent ClF to create a brightly colored product.\n\n4.  **Reaction 2: Formation of E**: `C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous)`.\n    Substituting D = F₂, the reaction becomes `C + 2 F₂(g) → E (extremely hazardous)`. This implies that the bright red compound C reacts with more fluorine to yield the final hazardous product E.\n\n### Identifying the Compounds and Product E\n\nThis set of clues is famously part of a puzzle detailing the synthesis of **xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**, though some details in the common puzzle are slightly altered for effect. Let's see how it might be adapted. If E were XeF₄, its synthesis from `C + 2F₂` would imply C is a lower fluoride of xenon, such as `XeF₂`. However, `XeF₂` is a colorless solid, contradicting the \"bright red product C\" clue.\n\nGiven the significant contradictions when trying to fit all clues perfectly, a common feature of such riddles is that the final question can be answered by identifying the most likely candidate for E based on the options provided. The description points towards advanced, reactive chemistry, where noble gas compounds are a common topic.\n\n**Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)** is an iconic molecule in chemistry, known for being one of the first noble gas compounds discovered. It is a hazardous substance that reacts violently with water. Its molecular geometry is a key example taught in VSEPR theory.\n\n*   **Molecule E**: Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)\n*   **Molecular Geometry**: The molecule has a central xenon atom bonded to four fluorine atoms arranged at the corners of a square in a single plane. The xenon atom also has two lone pairs of electrons, positioned above and below the plane. This arrangement is known as **square planar**.\n*   **Molecular Symmetry**: The square planar geometry of XeF₄ gives it a high degree of symmetry. It possesses a four-fold principal rotation axis (C₄), perpendicular two-fold axes (C₂), a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and vertical mirror planes (σv). This combination of symmetry elements places it in the **D₄h** point group.\n\nThus, by identifying the extremely hazardous product E as the classic square planar molecule XeF₄, we can determine its molecular symmetry group.\n\n<<<B>>>"
