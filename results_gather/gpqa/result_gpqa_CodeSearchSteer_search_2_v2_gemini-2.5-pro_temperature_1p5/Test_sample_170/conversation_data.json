    "To determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. Substituents can be classified as activating or deactivating, and as ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nFirst, let's categorize each substituent:\n1.  **-CH3 (in Toluene):** An alkyl group, which is activating and an ortho, para-director.\n2.  **-COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate):** A deactivating group and a meta-director.\n3.  **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene):** A halogen, which is deactivating but an ortho, para-director.\n4.  **-NO2 (in Nitrobenzene):** A strongly deactivating group and a meta-director.\n5.  **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene):** An alkyl group, which is activating and an ortho, para-director.\n6.  **-COOH (in Benzoic acid):** A deactivating group and a meta-director.\n\n### **Ordering Based on Director Type**\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer is significant only for ortho, para-directing substituents. For meta-directing substituents, the para-isomer is formed in very small, often negligible amounts.\n\n*   **Lowest Para Yield (Meta-Directors):**\n    *   Substances 4 (C6H5-NO2), 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5), and 6 (C6H5-COOH) are all meta-directors. The electrophilic attack is strongly directed to the meta position, meaning the para-isomer yield is extremely low. For the nitration of a benzoic ester, which is chemically similar to ethyl benzoate, the para isomer yield is about 5%, while the meta isomer is 73%. Bromination of nitrobenzene primarily yields the meta-bromo isomer. For these strongly deactivating, meta-directing groups, the para yield is minimal. The order among them is based on the strength of their deactivating and meta-directing nature. The generally accepted order of deactivating strength is -NO2 > -COOH > -COOR. A stronger deactivating group leads to an even smaller percentage of the para product. Thus, the order of increasing para yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Highest Para Yield (Ortho, Para-Directors):**\n    *   Substances 1 (C6H5-CH3), 5 (C6H5-C2H5), and 3 (C6H5-Cl) are all ortho, para-directors. They will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer.\n    *   The ratio of para to ortho product is heavily influenced by **steric hindrance**. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n    *   Comparing the ortho, para-directors:\n        *   **Toluene (-CH3):** The methyl group is relatively small. The bromination of toluene yields about 66.8% para-isomer. Other sources suggest a para-yield of around 56%.\n        *   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance disfavors ortho substitution, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer. For example, in nitration, moving from toluene to tert-butylbenzene (a very bulky group) increases the para-isomer yield from 37% to 75%. The bromination of ethylbenzene is expected to give a very high para yield.\n        *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** Halogens are an exception; they are deactivating but ortho, para-directing. Despite being deactivating, the para-isomer is strongly favored. Nitration of chlorobenzene, for instance, gives about 70% para-product.\n\n*   **Refined Order of Ortho, Para-Directors:**\n    *   To establish the precise order, we compare the para-yields.\n    *   **Toluene (1):** Para yield is significant but the lowest among the three due to the relatively small size of the methyl group. (~56-67%)\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (5):** The larger ethyl group leads to more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, thus a higher para yield than toluene.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3):** The bromination of chlorobenzene yields ortho and para isomers in a ratio of about 0.1 to 1, which means the para isomer can be up to ~90% of the o/p mixture. Comparing this with the ~56-67% for toluene, chlorobenzene gives a higher para yield. When comparing ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene, ethylbenzene's larger size typically leads to an even greater preference for the para position than chlorine. However, the options provided place -Cl after the alkyl groups. Let's re-examine this. For nitration, ethylbenzene yields 49% para. In another source for nitration, chlorobenzene gives 70% para and toluene gives 37% para. The data can vary with reaction conditions, but the general trend related to sterics holds: a larger group increases the para ratio. The steric order is C2H5 > CH3. The electronic and steric balance for Cl results in a high para yield, often intermediate between small and large alkyl groups.\n    *   Let's follow the most cited trend: Steric hindrance increases the para/ortho ratio. The steric bulk is C2H5 > CH3. Chlorine's size is comparable to a methyl group but its electronic effects also strongly favor the para position. Looking at the options, a common pattern tested in chemistry is the steric effect on alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for the o,p-directors is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3). *Correction based on typical data*: Chlorobenzene (~70-90% para) and Ethylbenzene (~49% para for nitration, expected to be higher but perhaps not as high as for Cl for bromination) have yields that need careful comparison. However, all options end with `1<5<3` or `1<5`. Option A ends in `...<3<1<5`, B `...<1<6<2<4`, C `...<5<1<3`, and D `...<1<5<3`. Options D seems most plausible for the ortho-para directors based on common textbook examples where steric hindrance is the dominant factor shown for alkyl groups, and halogens give very high para yields.\n\n### **Final Assembly**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Meta-Directors (lowest yield):** Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic Acid (6) < Ethyl Benzoate (2).\n2.  **Ortho, Para-Directors (highest yield):** Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nThe complete sequence is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe derived sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
