    "The problem is a chemical equilibrium calculation involving a metal-ligand complex.\n\n1.  **Reaction Setup:** The Ca-EDTA complex dissociates according to the following equilibrium:\n    Ca-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** The formation constant (K_f), also known as the stability constant, is given for the forward reaction:\n    K_f = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺] [EDTA⁴⁻])\n    The value provided is K_Ca-EDTA = 5.0 x 10¹⁰. This value is consistent with published data.\n\n3.  **Initial Concentrations:**\n    *   Initial [Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 M\n    *   Initial [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n    *   Initial [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n\n4.  **Change in Concentrations (let 'x' be the change):**\n    *   As the complex dissociates, the concentration of Ca-EDTA²⁻ decreases by x.\n    *   The concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ each increase by x.\n\n5.  **Equilibrium Concentrations:**\n    *   [Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\n6.  **Substituting into the equilibrium expression:**\n    5.0 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5.0 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n7.  **Simplification:** Because the formation constant K_f is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the left, meaning the complex is very stable and will only dissociate slightly. Therefore, the value of x will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the approximation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n8.  **Solving for x:**\n    5.0 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 6.3x10^-7 M\nB) 2.0x10^-2 M\nC) 1.0x10^-2 M\nD) 5.0x10^-3 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
