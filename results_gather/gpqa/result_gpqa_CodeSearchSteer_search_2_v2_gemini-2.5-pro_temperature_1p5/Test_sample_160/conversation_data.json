    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2:\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (λ):** The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is λ = 1/(nσ), where 'n' is the number density of the target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section. The cross-section can be thought of as the effective target area a particle presents for a collision.\n\n2.  **Analyzing λ1 (Gas Molecule Mean Free Path):**\n    *   λ1 is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding with *each other*.\n    *   In this case, the projectile is a gas molecule, and the targets are other gas molecules. The number density of these target molecules is 'n'.\n    *   The relevant cross-section, σ1, is the kinetic collision cross-section, which is related to the physical size of the molecules. For two identical spherical molecules of diameter d, the cross-section σ1 is πd².\n\n3.  **Analyzing λ2 (Electron Mean Free Path):**\n    *   λ2 is the mean free path of the beam electrons scattering off the residual gas molecules.\n    *   Here, the projectile is a high-energy electron (1000 kV = 1 MeV), and the targets are the same gas molecules with the same number density 'n'.\n    *   The relevant cross-section, σ2, is the electron scattering cross-section. This is not determined by the physical size in the same way, but by the probability of interaction between the electron and the electrostatic field of the gas molecule.\n\n4.  **Comparing the Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2):**\n    *   **Gas-Molecule Cross-Section (σ1):** This is based on the molecule's physical dimensions, which are on the order of angstroms (1 Å = 10⁻¹⁰ m). For a typical gas like N₂, the collision cross-section is approximately 30-40 Å².\n    *   **Electron Scattering Cross-Section (σ2):** The scattering cross-section for an electron depends heavily on its energy. For very high-energy (relativistic) electrons, such as the 1 MeV electrons in this scenario, the probability of interaction with a gas molecule is much lower than for a slow-moving particle. The electron is moving so fast that it can often pass through the atomic structure of the gas molecule with little to no interaction. Theoretical and experimental data show that electron scattering cross-sections decrease significantly as electron energy increases into the keV and MeV range. For 1 MeV electrons, the scattering cross-section (σ2) is substantially smaller than the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecules (σ1).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have λ1 = 1/(nσ1) and λ2 = 1/(nσ2).\n    *   The number density 'n' is the same in both situations.\n    *   Our analysis shows that σ1 (gas-gas collision) > σ2 (high-energy electron-gas scattering). In fact, σ1 is much larger than σ2.\n    *   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the cross-section (σ), a much smaller cross-section for the electrons (σ2) results in a much larger mean free path (λ2).\n    *   Therefore, we can firmly conclude that λ2 >> λ1 (λ2 is much greater than λ1).\n\n    Looking at the given options:\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This correctly states that λ2 is greater than λ1. Given that λ2 is expected to be significantly larger, this inequality holds true.\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is incorrect because it implies λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1. The physical reality is that the difference is substantial.\n\nThe most accurate conclusion among the choices is that λ2 is greater than λ1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
