    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Normalize the Initial State\n\nThe given state of the electron is `|alpha> ∝ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nLet the normalized state be `|alpha> = C * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`.\n\nFor a state to be normalized, the inner product `<alpha|alpha>` must equal 1.\nThe corresponding \"bra\" vector is `<alpha| = C* * [(1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|]`.\n\nThe inner product is:\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)] = 1`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1 - i²) + (4 - i²)] = 1`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1 + 1) + (4 + 1)] = 1`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * (2 + 5) = 1`\n`|C|^2 * 7 = 1  => |C|^2 = 1/7`\n\nSo, the normalization constant is `C = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nThe normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\n\n### 2. Find the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of Operator A\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `Aij = 0` otherwise. In the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, this corresponds to the matrix:\n`A = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`λ`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]]) = 0`\n`λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\n`λ² = hbar²/4`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNext, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors.\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    `[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] * [[a], [b]] = [[0], [0]]`\n    This gives the equation `-a + b = 0`, so `a = b`. The corresponding eigenvector is proportional to `[[1], [1]]`.\n    Normalizing this gives the eigenvector `|v₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    `[[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] * [[a], [b]] = [[0], [0]]`\n    This gives the equation `a + b = 0`, so `a = -b`. The corresponding eigenvector is proportional to `[[1], [-1]]`.\n    Normalizing this gives the eigenvector `|v₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state vector `|alpha>` onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₁ = +hbar/2 (P₁):**\n    `P₁ = |<v₁|alpha>|²`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>)]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) + (2-i)] = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    `P₁ = |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₂ = -hbar/2 (P₂):**\n    `P₂ = |<v₂|alpha>|²`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>)]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) - (2-i)] = (1/sqrt(14)) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Average (Expectation) Value of A\n\nThe expectation value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    `<A> = P₁*λ₁ + P₂*λ₂`\n    `<A> = (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the matrix representation**\n    `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`\n    `<A> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `hbar/7`. These results match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
