    "To find the energy spectrum for a particle in the given potential, we first need to express the potential in Cartesian coordinates. This will allow us to see if the Schrödinger equation is separable.\n\n**1. Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nThe relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n*   y = r sin(θ)\n*   r² = x² + y²\n\nFrom these, we can see that cos²(θ) = x²/r². Substituting the Cartesian equivalents into the potential equation:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k r² (x²/r²)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n**2. Separate the Hamiltonian**\n\nThe potential is now in the form V(x, y) = Vₓ(x) + Vᵧ(y), which describes a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is a sum of independent terms for x and y, the Hamiltonian can be separated into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n\n*   H = Hₓ + Hᵧ\n*   Hₓ = - (ħ²/2m) ∂²/∂x² + 2kx²\n*   Hᵧ = - (ħ²/2m) ∂²/∂y² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThe total energy E will be the sum of the energies from each oscillator: E = Eₓ + Eᵧ.\n\n**3. Find the Energy Spectrum for Each Oscillator**\n\nThe standard energy spectrum for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential V(q) = 1/2 mω²q² is given by Eₙ = (n + 1/2)ħω. We need to find the angular frequencies (ωₓ and ωᵧ) for our system.\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    *   Vₓ(x) = 2kx². We compare this to the standard form Vₓ(x) = 1/2 mωₓ²x².\n    *   1/2 mωₓ² = 2k  => ωₓ² = 4k/m => ωₓ = 2√(k/m).\n    *   The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n        Eₙₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħωₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ(2√(k/m)) = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m).\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    *   Vᵧ(y) = 1/2 ky². We compare this to the standard form Vᵧ(y) = 1/2 mωᵧ²y².\n    *   1/2 mωᵧ² = 1/2 k => ωᵧ² = k/m => ωᵧ = √(k/m).\n    *   The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n        Eₙᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m).\n\n**4. Sum the Energies**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of Eₙₓ and Eₙᵧ:\n\nE = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\nE = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m) + (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\nE = [ (2nₓ + 1) + (nᵧ + 1/2) ] ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 3/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
