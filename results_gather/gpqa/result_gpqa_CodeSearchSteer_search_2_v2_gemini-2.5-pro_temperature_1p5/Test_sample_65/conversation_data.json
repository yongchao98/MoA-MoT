    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local, Poincaré-invariant quantum field theory. This foundational principle dictates which symmetries must be respected by all operators within the theory.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the symmetries in question:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in the Standard Model and special relativity. SMEFT is constructed to be Lorentz invariant, meaning all operators must be Lorentz scalars (invariant under rotations and boosts).\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry:** This is an extension of Lorentz symmetry that also includes translations in space and time. It is a cornerstone of quantum field theory, and the SMEFT Lagrangian is required to be invariant under the Poincaré group.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** This is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry. SMEFT is designed to parameterize possible new physics, including new sources of CP violation, so its operators are not required to respect CP symmetry. In fact, many studies are dedicated to classifying the numerous CP-violating operators in SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** This is the combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time-reversal (T). The CPT theorem, a fundamental result in quantum field theory, states that any local, Lorentz-invariant theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT-invariant. Since SMEFT is built on these principles, it is CPT-conserving.\n\nTherefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. CP symmetry is not a required symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
