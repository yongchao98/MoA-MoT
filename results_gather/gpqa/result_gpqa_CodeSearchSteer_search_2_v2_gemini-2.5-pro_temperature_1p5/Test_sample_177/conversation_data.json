    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we first need to establish the mass dimensions of the fields and operators in the Lagrangian density  \\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu} .\n\n### 1. Mass Dimensions of Fields and Operators\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action S = ∫d⁴x L is dimensionless.\n*   The four-volume element d⁴x has a mass dimension of [d⁴x] = M⁻⁴.\n*   Therefore, the Lagrangian density L must have a mass dimension of [L] = M⁴ to ensure the action is dimensionless.\n\nNow we determine the mass dimension of each component of the interaction Lagrangian:\n*   **Fermion field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion field is  L_Dirac = \\bar{\\psi}(iγ^μ∂_μ)ψ . For this term to have a mass dimension of M⁴, we have [\\bar{ψ}][ψ][∂_μ] = M⁴. Since [∂_μ] = M¹ and [\\bar{ψ}] = [ψ], this gives 2[ψ] + 1 = 4, which means the fermion field has a mass dimension of [ψ] = M³/².\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor (F^(μν)):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is L_EM = -1/4 F_(μν)F^(μν) . For this term to have a mass dimension of M⁴, we must have [F^(μν)]² = M⁴, which results in [F^(μν)] = M².\n*   **Sigma matrix (σ_(μν)):** The term σ_(μν) = i/2[γ_μ, γ_ν] is composed of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Therefore, [σ_(μν)] = M⁰.\n\n### 2. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant (κ)\n\nThe interaction term  \\mathcal{L}_{int} must also have a mass dimension of M⁴. We can write the dimensional equation as:\n[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [κ] [\\bar{\\psi}] [σ_(μν)] [ψ] [F^(μν)] = M⁴\n\nSubstituting the known mass dimensions:\n[κ] * (M³/²) * (M⁰) * (M³/²) * (M²) = M⁴\n[κ] * M³ * M² = M⁴\n[κ] * M⁵ = M⁴\n\nSolving for the mass dimension of κ:\n[κ] = M⁴ / M⁵ = M⁻¹\n\nSo, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### 3. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant is **dimensionless** (mass dimension 0), the theory is renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, the theory described by this interaction Lagrangian is non-renormalizable. Such interaction terms, sometimes called Pauli terms, can arise in effective field theories.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
