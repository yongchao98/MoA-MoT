    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction.\n\n### 1. Normalize the Spin State\n\nThe given unnormalized spin state is a column vector:\n|ψ⟩ = (3i, 4)\n\nTo calculate the expectation value, the state vector must first be normalized. The norm of the state is found by taking the inner product of the state with itself, which involves the complex conjugate transpose (the \"bra\" vector, ⟨ψ|).\n\n⟨ψ| = (-3i, 4)\n\nThe squared norm is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25\n\nThe normalization constant is the square root of this value, which is √25 = 5.\n\nThe normalized spin state, |ψ_norm⟩, is obtained by dividing the original state by its norm:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) * (3i, 4)\n\nThe corresponding normalized \"bra\" is:\n⟨ψ_norm| = (1/5) * (-3i, 4)\n\n### 2. Define the Spin Operator\n\nThe operator for the spin component in the y-direction, S_y, for a spin-1/2 particle like an electron is given by:\nS_y = (ħ/2)σ_y\n\nWhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant and σ_y is the Pauli Y matrix.\n\nS_y = (ħ/2) * \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value\n\nThe expectation value of an operator S is calculated by the formula ⟨S⟩ = ⟨ψ|S|ψ⟩. For S_y, this is:\n⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm| S_y |ψ_norm⟩\n\nLet's substitute the normalized state and the operator into the formula:\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = (1/5) * (-3i, 4) * [(ħ/2) * \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n] * (1/5) * \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3i \\\\\n4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nFirst, multiply the operator matrix by the \"ket\" vector:\n(ħ/2) * \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} * \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3i \\\\\n4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= (ħ/2) * \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\\\\n(i)(3i) + (0)(4)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= (ħ/2) * \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-4i \\\\\n3i²\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= (ħ/2) * \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-4i \\\\\n-3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nNow, multiply the resulting vector by the \"bra\" vector and the normalization constants:\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = (1/25) * (-3i, 4) * (ħ/2) * \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-4i \\\\\n-3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [12i² - 12]\n\nSince i² = -1:\n⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [-12 - 12] = (ħ/50) * [-24]\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = -24ħ/50 = -12ħ/25\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
