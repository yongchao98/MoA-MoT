    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Initial State and Operators**\n\n*   The initial state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n*   The operator for observable P is represented by the matrix:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n*   The operator for observable Q is represented by the matrix:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n**2. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nThe probability calculations in quantum mechanics require the state vector to be normalized. A vector is normalized if its inner product with itself is 1.\n\n*   First, calculate the squared norm of `|ψ⟩`:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n*   The normalization constant is `1/√6`.\n*   The normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n    `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvector of P for the Eigenvalue 0**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of measuring P and getting 0. We need the eigenvector of P that corresponds to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.\n\n*   We need to solve the equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`, where `|v⟩ = [x, y, z]`:\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0]`\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n*   Choosing `x = 1`, we get `z = -1`. The unnormalized eigenvector `|p₀⟩` is `[1, 0, -1]`.\n*   Normalize this eigenvector:\n    *   Squared norm = `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`\n    *   Normalized eigenvector `|p₀_norm⟩` = `(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability of Measuring P = 0**\n\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for P is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state `|ψ_norm⟩` onto the eigenvector `|p₀_norm⟩`.\n\n*   `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n*   First, calculate the inner product `⟨p₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩`:\n    `⟨p₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = ((1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]) ⋅ ((1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1])`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2/√12 = -1/√3`\n*   Now, square the magnitude:\n    `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n**5. Determine the State After Measuring P = 0**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system \"collapses\" into the corresponding normalized eigenvector `|p₀_norm⟩`.\n\n*   The new state of the system is `|ψ'⟩ = |p₀_norm⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n\n**6. Find the Eigenvector of Q for the Eigenvalue -1**\n\nNext, we measure Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩` and want to find the probability of getting -1. We need the eigenvector of Q for the eigenvalue `λ = -1`.\n\n*   Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 (the third diagonal element) is:\n    `|q₋₁⟩ = [0, 0, 1]` (This is already normalized).\n\n**7. Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q = -1**\n\nThe probability of measuring Q = -1 in the state `|ψ'⟩` is the squared magnitude of the projection of `|ψ'⟩` onto `|q₋₁⟩`.\n\n*   `Prob(Q=-1) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²`\n*   Calculate the inner product `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩`:\n    `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] ⋅ ((1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]) = (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`\n*   Now, square the magnitude:\n    `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**8. Calculate the Total Probability**\n\nThe probability of a sequence of independent measurements is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\n*   Total Probability = `Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n*   Total Probability = `(1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
