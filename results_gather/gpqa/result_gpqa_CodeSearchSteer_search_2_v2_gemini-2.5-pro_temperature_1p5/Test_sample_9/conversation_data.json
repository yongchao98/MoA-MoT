    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to analyze the properties of each option. The key principle is that for planets with the same rocky composition, density increases with mass due to greater gravitational compression.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is a baseline reference to our own planet. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as about 5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** Planets with the same composition but higher mass experience stronger gravitational forces, which compress the material and lead to a higher overall density. Theoretical models and observations of so-called \"super-Earths\" confirm that a rocky planet of 5 Earth masses would be significantly denser than Earth. For example, the rocky exoplanet LHS 1478 b has a mass of about 2.33 Earths and a density of 6.67 g/cm³. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet of similar composition would be even denser.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with less mass would have weaker gravity and therefore less compression. This results in a density lower than Earth's. Mars, for instance, has about a tenth of Earth's mass and a lower density of about 3.93 g/cm³. A planet with half of Earth's mass and the same composition would be less dense than Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the 5-Earth-mass planet (c) will be the most compressed by its own gravity, resulting in the highest density. The planet in option (d) would be the least dense. The planets in options (a) and (b) have nearly identical densities. Therefore, the planet with 5 times the mass of Earth has the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
