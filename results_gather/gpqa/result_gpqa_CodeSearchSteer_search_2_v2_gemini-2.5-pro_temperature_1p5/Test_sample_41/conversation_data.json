    "The calculations and the physical principles used seem correct.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**: The search results confirm that the equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to (1/a^2)^(1/4), which simplifies to a^(-1/2), where 'a' is the semi-major axis. This confirms my derivation:\n    T_i / T_j = (a_j / a_i)^(1/2)  =>  a_j / a_i = (T_i / T_j)^2.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law**: The search results also confirm that for planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of the squares of their orbital periods is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their semi-major axes.\n    (P_i / P_j)^2 = (a_i / a_j)^3  =>  P_i / P_j = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2).\n\n3.  **Irrelevant Information**: The problem provides the albedo value and the ratios of the planetary masses.\n    *   The albedo is the same for all three planets, so it cancels out in the temperature ratio calculation, as I assumed.\n    *   The planetary masses are typically negligible compared to the star's mass and are ignored in the simplified version of Kepler's Third Law. The information about the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method, which is used to *determine* planetary masses, along with the mass ratios themselves, appears to be extraneous information intended to distract. The simplified law is appropriate here.\n\nThe steps remain the same:\n1.  Use the temperature ratios to find the ratios of the semi-major axes.\n2.  Combine the semi-major axis ratios to find a3/a1.\n3.  Use Kepler's Third Law to find the period ratio P3/P1.\n\n**Calculations:**\n*   Ratio of semi-major axes from temperature ratios:\n    *   `a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 = 1.4^2 = 1.96`\n    *   `a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^2 = 2.3^2 = 5.29`\n\n*   Combined ratio of semi-major axes:\n    *   `a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684`\n\n*   Ratio of orbital periods using Kepler's Third Law:\n    *   `P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)`\n    *   `P3 / P1 ≈ 33.398`\n\nThis result strongly matches option C.\n\nFinal check of the question and my understanding.\n- System of three exoplanets orbiting the same star.\n- Circular orbits (semi-major axis = orbital radius).\n- T_eq1/T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n- T_eq2/T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n- Albedo is equal for all.\n- Goal: Find P3 / P1.\n\nThe logic holds, and the calculations are straightforward. The extraneous information regarding TTV and mass ratios can be safely ignored. The answer is ~33.4.To solve this problem, we need to relate the orbital period of a planet to its equilibrium temperature. This involves two key physical principles: the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the luminosity of its star (L), the planet's albedo (A), and its orbital distance, or semi-major axis (a). The formula is given by:\n\nT_eq ∝ ( (1-A) / a² )^(1/4)\n\nSince the planets orbit the same star, L is constant. The problem states that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1 / a²)^(1/4) = a^(-1/2)\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. For any two planets (i and j) in the system, the ratio of their temperatures is:\n\nT_i / T_j = (a_j / a_i)^(1/2)\n\nBy squaring both sides, we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n\n(T_i / T_j)² = a_j / a_i\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Ratios of the Semi-Major Axes\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing the formula from Step 1, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n\n*   For Planet 1 and Planet 2:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n\n*   For Planet 2 and Planet 3:\n    a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 (a₃ / a₁), we multiply the two ratios we just found:\n\na₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n### Step 3: Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Orbital Period Ratio\n\nKepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). The ratio for any two planets (i and j) is:\n\n(P_i / P_j)² = (a_i / a_j)³\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the periods is:\n\nP_i / P_j = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2)\n\nWe want to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 (P₃ / P₁). Using the value of a₃ / a₁ calculated in Step 2:\n\nP₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n\nP₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.398\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThe information regarding the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is not necessary for this calculation, as the planet masses are negligible compared to the star's mass in the context of Kepler's Third Law.\n\nFinal Answer is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
