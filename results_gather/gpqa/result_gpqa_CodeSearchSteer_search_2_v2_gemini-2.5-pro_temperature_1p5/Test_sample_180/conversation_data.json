    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate ratio of the neutrino fluxes.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Solar Neutrino Spectrum\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several reactions in the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. Each reaction produces neutrinos with a characteristic energy spectrum.\n\n*   **pp-I Branch:**\n    *   `p + p → ²H + e⁺ + νe` (`pp` neutrinos): Continuous spectrum up to 0.42 MeV.\n*   **pp-II Branch:**\n    *   `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe` (`⁷Be` neutrinos): Produces a mono-energetic line at **0.861 MeV** (861 keV) about 90% of the time. This is the crucial reaction for this problem.\n*   **pp-III Branch:**\n    *   `⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νe` (`⁸B` neutrinos): Produces a continuous spectrum of high-energy neutrinos up to about 15 MeV.\n*   **CNO Cycle:**\n    *   This cycle also produces neutrinos, notably from `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` decays, with continuous spectra up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**. This has a very specific consequence:\n*   The production of **⁸B neutrinos ceases**.\n\nAll other reactions, including the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycle, continue as they were.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Flux in Each Energy Band\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the neutrino flux in two energy bands after the pp-III branch has stopped.\n\n*   **Band 1: 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV)**\n*   **Band 2: 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV)**\n\nLet's examine the sources of neutrinos in each band *after* the change:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   `pp` neutrinos (max 420 keV) do not contribute.\n    *   `⁷Be` neutrinos are a line at 861 keV, outside this band.\n    *   `⁸B` neutrinos are now gone.\n    *   The only remaining contributors are neutrinos from the **CNO cycle** (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`). The CNO cycle accounts for only about 1% of the Sun's energy generation, and its neutrino flux is correspondingly low compared to the main pp chain fluxes.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The primary contributor to this band is the very strong, mono-energetic line from **⁷Be decay at 861 keV**, which falls squarely within this range. The pp-II branch, which produces these neutrinos, is unaffected.\n    *   `⁸B` neutrinos are gone.\n    *   There is also a small contribution from the continuous spectrum of **CNO cycle** neutrinos in this range.\n\n### 4. Determining the Ratio\n\nWe are now comparing the flux from a small portion of the CNO spectrum to the total flux of the massive ⁷Be line.\n\n*   **Flux(Band 1):** This is the integral of the CNO neutrino spectrum over the 0.7-0.8 MeV range. Looking at solar neutrino spectrum plots, the differential flux from CNO sources in this region is relatively low.\n*   **Flux(Band 2):** This is dominated by the entire flux of the 0.861 MeV ⁷Be neutrino line, which is a very large number, plus a small contribution from the CNO spectrum. The total flux of the ⁷Be line is about two orders of magnitude greater than the total flux from the `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` CNO sources combined.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n\nFlux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) ≈ (small flux from CNO neutrinos) / (large flux from ⁷Be line neutrinos)\n\nThis results in a very small number. To get a precise value, we can look at the predicted fluxes from the Standard Solar Model.\n\n*   The total flux of the ⁷Be line at 0.861 MeV is approximately **4.8 x 10⁹ neutrinos cm⁻² s⁻¹**.\n*   The total flux of the relevant CNO neutrinos (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`) is on the order of **5 x 10⁸ neutrinos cm⁻² s⁻¹**.\n\nThe flux in Band 1 is only a small fraction of this total CNO flux integrated over a 0.1 MeV window. A rough estimation from solar neutrino spectra indicates that the integrated CNO flux in the 700-800 keV band is on the order of 10⁷ cm⁻² s⁻¹.\n\nRatio ≈ (10⁷) / (4.8 x 10⁹) ≈ 0.002\n\nThis value is very close to 0.01. The key takeaway is the dramatic difference in magnitude between the remaining fluxes in the two bands. Band 2 contains a major, discrete neutrino source (the ⁷Be line), while Band 1 is left with only the tail end of minor, continuous sources (the CNO cycle) after the dominant `⁸B` flux is removed.\n\nComparing our result with the options provided:\n*   A) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n*   B) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n*   C) 10\n*   D) 1\n\nThe calculated ratio is much smaller than 1, making A the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
