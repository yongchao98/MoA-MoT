    "To find the numerical value of \"a,\" we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. The Born rule states that the probability of finding a particle in a specific region is the integral of the square of the modulus of its wave function over that region. Since the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, the probability of finding a particle in this interval is 1.\n\nThe wave function is given by:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nFirst, we calculate the square of the modulus of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|². The modulus squared of a complex number (Re + i*Im) is Re² + Im².\n*   Real part: Re(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n*   Imaginary part: Im(x) = -0.5\n\nTherefore, the probability density function is:\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNext, we set up the normalization integral. The integral of the probability density function from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1:\n∫¹₃ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\na² ∫¹₃ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫¹₃ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve each integral:\n1.  The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|.\n    *   Evaluating from 1 to 3: [ln(1+3) - ln(1+1)] = [ln(4) - ln(2)] = ln(4/2) = ln(2).\n\n2.  The integral of 0.25 is 0.25x.\n    *   Evaluating from 1 to 3: 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value of ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\n\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
