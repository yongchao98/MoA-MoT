    "The angle between the directions of the two photons produced in the annihilation of an electron and a positron can be determined by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy of the two photons produced after the collision. The relativistic energy (E) of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron (E_e) = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²\n    *   Energy of the positron (E_p) = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 * m_e * c²\n    *   The total initial energy (E_initial) is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron:\n        E_initial = 4 * m_e * c² + 2 * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²\n    *   The problem states that the two resulting photons have equal energy (E_γ). Therefore, the total final energy (E_final) is 2 * E_γ.\n    *   Equating the initial and final energy:\n        6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_γ\n        E_γ = 3 * m_e * c²\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum must also be conserved. The relativistic momentum (p) of a particle can be calculated using the formula p = mc√(γ² - 1).\n    *   Let the horizontal axis be the x-axis. The electron moves in the positive x-direction, and the positron moves in the negative x-direction.\n    *   Momentum of the electron (p_e) = m_e * c * √(4² - 1) = m_e * c * √15\n    *   Momentum of the positron (p_p) = m_e * c * √(2² - 1) = m_e * c * √3\n    *   The total initial momentum (P_initial) is purely in the x-direction:\n        P_initial_x = p_e - p_p = m_e * c * (√15 - √3)\n    *   The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero.\n\n3.  **Final Momentum of the Photons:** Each photon has an energy E_γ = 3 * m_e * c². The momentum of a photon is given by p_γ = E_γ / c.\n    *   p_γ = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c\n    *   The photons move away at equal and opposite angles (θ and -θ) with respect to the horizontal axis due to momentum conservation in the y-direction. The total y-momentum remains zero.\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction (P_final_x) is the sum of the x-components of the two photons' momenta:\n        P_final_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)\n        P_final_x = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n\n4.  **Solving for the Angle:** By equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\n    *   m_e * c * (√15 - √3) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n    *   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n    *   Using the approximate values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\n        cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is 2θ.\nAngle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to 138 degrees. For annihilations where the initial particles are in flight with a net momentum, the angle between the resulting photons is expected to be less than 180 degrees.\n\n<<<C>>>"
