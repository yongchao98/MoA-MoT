    "Answering this question requires a multi-step analysis, determining the visibility and brightness of each listed star relative to the capabilities of the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory.\n\n### Step 1: Observability from Paranal\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. This southern location restricts which stars are visible in the sky. A star's declination (celestial latitude) determines its visibility from a given terrestrial latitude.\n\n*   **Canopus:** Has a declination of about -52.7°. As a southern star, it is readily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Polaris:** As the North Star, its declination is almost +90° North (+89.26°). It is therefore impossible to observe from a latitude of ~24.6° South, as it is always far below the northern horizon.\n*   **Stars c, d, e, and f:** These hypothetical stars are located at a declination of 0°. Being on the celestial equator, they are observable from anywhere in the world, including Paranal.\n\nBased on location alone, Polaris can be ruled out.\n\n### Step 2: Apparent Magnitude Calculation\n\nA star's detectability depends on its apparent magnitude (how bright it appears from Earth), not its absolute magnitude (its intrinsic brightness).\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** This is the second-brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent V magnitude of approximately -0.74.\n*   **b) Polaris:** Has an apparent V magnitude of about 2.00. (Already ruled out by observability).\n*   **c) to f):** For these stars, the apparent magnitude (`m`) must be calculated from their absolute magnitude (`M` = 15) and distance (`d`) using the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`.\n\n    *   **c) Star at 10 pc:**\n        `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(1) = 15`\n    *   **d) Star at 200 pc:**\n        `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 21.5`\n    *   **e) Star at 5 pc:**\n        `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 13.5`\n    *   **f) Star at 50 pc:**\n        `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 18.5`\n\n### Step 3: ESPRESSO Detection Limit\n\nThe final step is to compare each observable star's apparent magnitude to the detection limit of ESPRESSO for the specified conditions (S/N = 10 in a 1-hour exposure with a single 8m VLT).\n\nAccording to a 2010 SPIE conference proceeding on the instrument, for the 1-UT (single telescope) mode, ESPRESSO can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 for a star with an apparent V magnitude of 17.1 in a total exposure time of one hour (three 20-minute exposures).\n\nTherefore, any observable star with an apparent magnitude of 17.1 or brighter (i.e., a smaller magnitude value) is considered detectable.\n\n### Conclusion: Counting the Detectable Stars\n\nLet's evaluate each star against the detection limit of V ≤ 17.1:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** Apparent magnitude ≈ -0.74. It is observable and much brighter than the limit. **Detectable.**\n*   **b) Polaris:** Not observable from Paranal. **Not Detectable.**\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:** Apparent magnitude = 15.0. It is observable and brighter than the limit. **Detectable.**\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:** Apparent magnitude ≈ 21.5. It is fainter than the limit. **Not Detectable.**\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:** Apparent magnitude ≈ 13.5. It is observable and brighter than the limit. **Detectable.**\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:** Apparent magnitude ≈ 18.5. It is fainter than the limit. **Not Detectable.**\n\nIn total, three of the listed stars would be detectable by ESPRESSO under the given conditions: Canopus, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc.\n\n<<<C>>>"
