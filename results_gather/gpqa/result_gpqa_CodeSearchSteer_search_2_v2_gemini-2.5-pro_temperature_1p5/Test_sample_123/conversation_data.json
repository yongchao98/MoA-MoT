    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The lifetime of a fast-moving particle, as observed in a stationary frame of reference (the lab), is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (its proper lifetime). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The number of particles that survive after a certain time follows an exponential decay law.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Probability:**\n    *   Let `R` be the radius of the detector (30 m).\n    *   Let `v` be the velocity of the particles. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. We can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the detector wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame is its proper lifetime, denoted by `τ`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the particle's mean lifetime in the lab frame is `t_dilated = γ * τ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The fraction `f` of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall is given by the exponential decay formula: `f = exp(-t_lab / t_dilated)`.\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas:**\n    Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `t_dilated`, we get:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n    This can be rewritten as `f = exp(-K / γ)`, where `K = R / (cτ)` is a constant value for this specific type of particle and detector setup.\n\n4.  **Use the Initial Conditions (Scenario 1):**\n    *   We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is ~20, one-third of the particles survive.\n    *   `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   Plugging these into our formula: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (Scenario 2):**\n    *   We want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which two-thirds of the particles survive.\n    *   `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n    *   Using the same formula with the new values: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n    Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n    `ln(1.5) = K / γ₂`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    Now we can substitute the value of `K` we found in Step 4:\n    `ln(1.5) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    Rearranging to solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated value of `54.19` is extremely close to the option `54`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
