    "### Analysis of Compound (A): Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** In this molecule, the carbon atoms adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds and do not have any attached hydrogen atoms. Without an α-hydrogen, benzoquinone cannot undergo the necessary proton transfer to form an enol tautomer. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses hydrogen atoms on the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6, which are α-hydrogens to the carbonyl groups. It can undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound, which fulfills Hückel's rule (cyclic, planar, conjugated, with 6 π-electrons). Because its enol form is highly stabilized by aromaticity, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily shows tautomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Analysis of Compound (B): Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom in the chain is bonded to four distinct groups: a methyl group (-CH₃), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since it has a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and thus exhibits optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). Due to the carbon-carbon double bond, the molecule is planar. This planarity results in a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive. While it has a stereoisomer (its cis- geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate), it does not have optical isomers.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
