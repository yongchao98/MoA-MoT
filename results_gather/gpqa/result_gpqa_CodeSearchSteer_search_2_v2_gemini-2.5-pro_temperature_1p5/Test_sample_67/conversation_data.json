    "This problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in an external magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle is in a spin-up state along the Z-axis. Its state vector `|ψ(0)>` is an eigenstate of the spin operator in the z-direction, `S_z`.\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: The magnetic field is switched to the Y-direction, `B = B_y`. The Hamiltonian of the system, which describes its energy, is given by `H = -μ · B = - (γS_y) * B`, where `μ` is the magnetic moment operator, `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio, and `S_y` is the spin operator in the y-direction.\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The particle's spin state evolves over time. This evolution is equivalent to the spin vector precessing around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis).\n4.  **Oscillation of <μ_z>**: The z-component of the magnetic moment is proportional to the expectation value of the spin operator `S_z`. As the spin precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate.\n5.  **Larmor Frequency**: The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, given by the formula `ω = γB`. This is the frequency at which the expectation value of any spin component perpendicular to the magnetic field will oscillate.\n\nSince the initial spin is along the Z-axis and the new magnetic field is along the Y-axis, the z-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) will oscillate as it precesses around the Y-axis. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, `γB`.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
