    "This problem requires evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a radially symmetric vector field within a sphere. The vector field is given by **f(r)**, which has a magnitude of 1/r² and points radially outward from the origin. The volume of integration is a sphere of radius *R* centered at the origin.\n\nThe integral to be evaluated is:\n∫ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV\n\nThis can be solved using two primary methods: direct calculation of the divergence followed by integration, or application of the Divergence Theorem.\n\n### Method 1: Direct Calculation\n\nThe vector field can be expressed in spherical coordinates as **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction. The formula for the divergence in spherical coordinates for a purely radial field is:\n\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * fᵣ)/∂r\n\nSubstituting fᵣ = 1/r², we get:\n\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) ∂(1)/∂r = 0\n\nThis result holds for all points where r ≠ 0. At the origin (r = 0), the field is singular (undefined), and a direct calculation of the divergence is not straightforward. In fact, the divergence at this point is infinite. This singularity acts as a source. For this specific field, the divergence is described by the Dirac delta function:\n\n∇ ⋅ **f** = 4πδ³(**r**)\n\nThe volume integral then becomes:\n\n∫ 4πδ³(**r**) dV over the sphere of radius R.\n\nSince the sphere is centered at the origin, it contains the point **r** = 0. The property of the Dirac delta function is that its integral over a volume containing the origin is 1. Therefore:\n\n∫ 4πδ³(**r**) dV = 4π ∫ δ³(**r**) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π\n\n### Method 2: Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)\n\nThe Divergence Theorem relates a volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface enclosing the volume.\n\n∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nHere, the closed surface *S* is the surface of the sphere of radius *R*.\n*   The vector field on the surface of the sphere is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n*   The differential surface area element on the sphere is d**S** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**.\n\nThe dot product **f** ⋅ d**S** is:\n\n**f** ⋅ d**S** = ( (1/R²) **r̂** ) ⋅ ( R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂** ) = sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nNow, we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere:\n\n∮ₛ sin(θ) dθ dφ = ∫ from φ=0 to 2π ∫ from θ=0 to π sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nFirst, integrating with respect to θ:\n∫ from 0 to π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -(-1) - (-1) = 2\n\nThen, integrating with respect to φ:\n∫ from 0 to 2π (2) dφ = [2φ] from 0 to 2π = 4π\n\nBoth methods yield a result of 4π. It is important to note that the Divergence Theorem is applicable here despite the singularity at the origin because the flux through any sphere centered at the origin is the same, regardless of its radius R>0. The result is independent of the radius *R* of the sphere, as long as the singularity at the origin is enclosed.\n\nComparing the result to the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 1\nD) 0\n\nThe most appropriate answer is 4π.\n\n<<<A>>>"
