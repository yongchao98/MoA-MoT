    "Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are quantum field theories that famously require regularization to handle infinite quantities that arise in calculations, particularly those involving loop diagrams which correspond to high-energy interactions. These methods, such as dimensional regularization or lattice regularization, introduce a parameter (a \"regulator\" or \"cutoff\") to make these calculations mathematically tractable before a process called renormalization is used.\n\nClassical Electrodynamics also suffers from a high-energy/short-distance divergence problem. Specifically, the self-energy of a point-like electron is infinite, which requires some form of regularization or re-interpretation to resolve.\n\nSuperstring Theory is unique among the options because it is believed to be free of these ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences. In string theory, fundamental particles are not point-like but are instead one-dimensional vibrating strings. This \"smears out\" the interactions at very short distances, which is precisely the regime where the infinities arise in other theories. This intrinsic property means that superstring theory does not need a separate regularization procedure for high-energy behavior. It is considered a UV-complete theory. While it may have infrared divergences (related to massless particles), it is believed to be free from the ultraviolet divergences that plague the other listed theories.\n\n<<<A>>>"
