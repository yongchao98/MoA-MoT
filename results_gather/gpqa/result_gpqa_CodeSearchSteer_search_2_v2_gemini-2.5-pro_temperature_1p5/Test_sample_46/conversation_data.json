    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A molecule's degree of unsaturation can be calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2). For C9H11NO2, this is 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5. A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for a conjugated ester (an ester attached to a double bond or aromatic ring).\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents three protons that are split into a triplet. This pattern (a methyl group adjacent to a methylene group) is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH2**CH3**).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for two protons, split into a quartet, corresponds to a methylene group next to a methyl group, confirming the ethyl fragment (-**CH2**CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates that this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-**NH2**). The broadness is due to factors like chemical exchange and quadrupolar relaxation. This corroborates the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and each integrating to two protons, are hallmarks of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, suggesting they are ortho to an electron-donating group (the -NH2 group). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester group).\n\n### Structure Determination\n\nCombining all the pieces of information:\n*   We have a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a *para* arrangement.\n\nThis assembly leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### Comparison with Options\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence. The 1H NMR data from literature for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate shows a triplet around 1.35 ppm, a quartet around 4.31 ppm, a broad singlet for the amine protons, and two doublets in the aromatic region around 6.6 and 7.8 ppm, which is in very good agreement with the provided data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This would be an isomer where the connectivity is different (Ar-O-C(=O)CH2CH3). The 1H NMR would show the -CH2- protons of the propionyl group at a much lower chemical shift (around 2.3-2.6 ppm).\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a *meta*-substituted isomer, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets. It is also a primary amide, not an ester.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H proton in the 1H NMR and a single N-H stretch in the IR spectrum. It also contains a formyl proton (-CHO) signal which is absent in the given data.\n\nTherefore, the data provided conclusively identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
