    "The provided information confirms the deductions made during the thinking process.\n\n*   **Substance X and its reactions:** Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) is a potent reducing agent used for deuterium labeling. It is the deuterated analog of the very common reagent lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water, and by extension, LiAlD₄ would react violently with heavy water (D₂O). The reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O produces LiOH, Al(OH)₃, and H₂ gas. By analogy, reacting LiAlD₄ with D₂O would produce LiOD, Al(OD)₃, and D₂ gas. Gas W, D₂, has one proton and one neutron per atom, meaning the molecule D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description of having an equal number.\n*   **Precipitate G and substance B:** The precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, analogous to aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃. When heated, aluminum hydroxide decomposes, releasing water. Therefore, Al(OD)₃ will decompose to release heavy water (D₂O), which is substance B.\n*   **Melting point of B:** The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. To convert this to Kelvin, we add 273.15. So, 3.82 + 273.15 = 276.97 K. This value is \"very close to 277 K\", confirming the identity of B.\n*   **Keto acid reaction:** LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing carboxylic acids and esters to primary alcohols. Therefore, it can reduce an α-keto acid (which contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group) to a diol, which would contain two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The lightest element in LiAlD₄ is hydrogen (atomic number 1), present as its heavier isotope deuterium (D). The atomic mass of deuterium is approximately 2.014 amu. For the calculation, we will use the mass number 2.\n    *   The heaviest element in LiAlD₄ is aluminum (atomic number 13). Its only stable isotope is aluminum-27. The atomic mass is approximately 26.98 amu. For the calculation, we will use the mass number 27.\n\n**Calculation**\n\nBased on the confirmed identity of Substance X as LiAlD₄, the elements and their cumulative masses are as follows:\n\n1.  **Lightest element:** Hydrogen, present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (²H or D).\n    *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n2.  **Heaviest element:** Aluminum, present as 1 atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al).\n    *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is the sum of these values:\nTotal mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
