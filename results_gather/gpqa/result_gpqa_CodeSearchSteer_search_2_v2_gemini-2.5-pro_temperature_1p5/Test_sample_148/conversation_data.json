    "The observations described—duplicate peaks for a single proton in NMR and two separable peaks of identical mass in LC-MS—point to the presence of isomers that are not mirror images of each other. Here is a breakdown of the evidence:\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:** The presence of two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since they have roughly equal integrals, the two species are present in approximately a 1:1 ratio. The fact that they are not enantiomers is crucial, as enantiomers are indistinguishable in an achiral environment like a standard NMR experiment and would produce only a single peak.\n*   **LC-MS Analysis:** The mass spectrometry (MS) data confirms that both species have the same mass, consistent with the expected product, ruling out contamination with a precursor (which would have a different mass). The liquid chromatography (LC) data shows that these two same-mass species can be separated. Standard reversed-phase LC cannot separate enantiomers. Therefore, the two species must be diastereomers, which have different physical properties and can be separated chromatographically.\n*   **Peptidic Compound Context:** For a peptidic compound, the most common source of such isomerism is the restricted rotation around an amide (peptide) bond. This creates stable rotational isomers (rotamers), often referred to as *cis* and *trans* isomers. These rotamers are a specific type of diastereomer. The energy barrier to interconversion between these forms is often high enough that they can be observed as separate species on the NMR and LC timescales. An alpha-proton adjacent to a rotameric amide bond will have a different chemical shift in the *cis* and *trans* states, explaining the two NMR peaks.\n\nBased on this evidence, the most comprehensive explanation is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers, most likely rotamers resulting from restricted amide bond rotation.\n\n*   **Option C (enantiomers)** is incorrect because enantiomers are not distinguishable by standard NMR or LC.\n*   **Option D (precursor contamination)** is incorrect because both observed peaks have the mass of the final product.\n*   **Option B ('double coupling')** is not a standard term for isomerism and would likely result in a product with a different mass, which contradicts the MS data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
