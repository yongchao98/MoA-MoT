    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the mean decay distance.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to find the average distance a particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays. This is known as the mean decay distance.\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics:**\n    *   A particle's lifetime in its own rest frame (proper lifetime, τ) is determined by its decay width (Γ).\n    *   Due to time dilation, in the laboratory frame where the particle is moving, its lifetime is longer by a factor of γ (the Lorentz factor). The lab lifetime is γτ.\n    *   The distance traveled is this lab lifetime multiplied by the particle's velocity (v).\n    *   Mean Decay Distance (d) = v * (γτ).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    *   The proper lifetime τ is given by the formula: τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s).\n    *   The Lorentz factor γ is the ratio of the total energy (E) to the rest mass energy (m): γ = E / m.\n    *   The velocity is usually expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, c, with β = v/c. The relationship between γ and β is γ = 1 / √(1 - β²).\n    *   A useful combination is βγ = p/m, where p is the momentum. From the relativistic energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + m², we can find that pc = √(E² - m²).\n    *   So, the mean decay distance `d` can be written as:\n        d = v * γ * τ = (βc) * γ * (ħ/Γ) = c * (βγ) * (ħ/Γ)\n        Substituting for βγ:\n        d = c * (p/m) * (ħ/Γ) = c * (√(E² - m²)/m) * (ħ/Γ)\n\n4.  **Plug in the Values:**\n    *   E_X = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n    *   m_X = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n    *   Γ_X = 320 MeV\n    *   ħ = 6.582119569... × 10⁻²² MeV·s\n    *   c = 299,792,458 m/s\n\n5.  **Calculate Step-by-Step:**\n\n    *   **Calculate the momentum-mass ratio (p/m = βγ):**\n        pc = √(E² - m²) = √(8000² - 1200²) = √(64,000,000 - 1,440,000) = √62,560,000 MeV\n        pc ≈ 7909.49 MeV\n        p/m = (pc) / m = 7909.49 MeV / 1200 MeV ≈ 6.5912\n\n    *   **Calculate the proper lifetime (τ):**\n        τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582 × 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV ≈ 2.057 × 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n    *   **Calculate the mean decay distance (d):**\n        d = c * (p/m) * τ\n        d ≈ (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s) * (6.5912) * (2.057 × 10⁻²⁴ s)\n        d ≈ 4.0655 × 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `ħc` constant (ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm, where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m) for a more direct calculation:\n\n*   d = (ħc / Γ) * (p/m)\n*   d = (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV) * (7909.49 MeV / 1200 MeV)\n*   d ≈ (0.6166 fm) * (6.5912)\n*   d ≈ 4.064 fm\n*   d ≈ 4.064 × 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nBoth methods yield a result that is extremely close to option C. The minor difference arises from the precision of the physical constants used. The calculation shows that 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m is the correct value.\n\n<<<C>>>"
