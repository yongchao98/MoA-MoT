    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This corresponds to a C₆H₄- group.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group is present (-COO-). This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms (CO₂). The carbonyl (C=O) in the ester is a source of one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   Six signals in total.\n        *   Two aromatic-H signals suggest a substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n        *   Two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This pattern is characteristic of a -CH=CH-CH₃ group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three methyl protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This fragment accounts for C₃H₅ and provides one of the two -CH₃ signals.\n        *   Two separate signals for -CH₃ groups. We've identified one in the -CH=CH-CH₃ group. The other must come from the second substituent.\n        *   **No signals for -CH₂ groups.** This is a critical piece of information for eliminating incorrect structures.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The information from the spectra indicates the presence of:\n    *   A benzene ring (4 DoU)\n    *   A carbon-carbon double bond (vinyl group, 1 DoU)\n    *   A carbon-oxygen double bond (ester group, 1 DoU)\n    The total degrees of unsaturation for the molecule must be 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n3.  **Check the DoU for each possible formula:**\n    The formula for degrees of unsaturation is DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For a CₓHᵧO₂ compound, this simplifies to DoU = (2x + 2 - y) / 2.\n    *   A) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = (2*11 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6. This matches our calculated DoU.\n    *   B) **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** DoU = (2*11 + 2 - 14) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5. This does not match.\n    *   C) **C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** DoU = (2*12 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7. This does not match.\n    *   D) **C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** DoU = (2*12 + 2 - 14) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6. This also matches our calculated DoU.\n\n4.  **Differentiate between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:**\n    We must use the remaining NMR information, specifically the absence of a -CH₂- signal, to distinguish between the two possibilities.\n\n    *   **For C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (Option A):**\n        Let's assemble the fragments we've identified:\n        *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n        *   Propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH₃ (C₃H₅)\n        *   Ester group and the second methyl group. The remaining atoms are C₁₁H₁₂O₂ - C₆H₄ - C₃H₅ = C₂H₃O₂.\n        *   The fragment C₂H₃O₂ perfectly corresponds to an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). This provides the ester function and the second -CH₃ signal.\n        *   A plausible structure would be **propenylphenyl acetate**. This molecule contains a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, and importantly, **no -CH₂- groups**. Thus, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is a valid candidate.\n\n    *   **For C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Option D):**\n        Let's assemble the fragments for this formula:\n        *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n        *   Propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH₃ (C₃H₅)\n        *   Ester group and the second methyl group. The remaining atoms are C₁₂H₁₄O₂ - C₆H₄ - C₃H₅ = C₃H₅O₂.\n        *   We need to form a substituent from C₃H₅O₂ that contains an ester and a methyl group. A plausible candidate is an ethyl ester group, **-COO-CH₂-CH₃**. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅O₂.\n        *   However, the ethyl ester group contains a **-CH₂- group**. The NMR data explicitly states there are no signals for -CH₂- groups. Any other arrangement of C₃H₅O₂ to form an ester substituent (like a propanoate group, -O-CO-CH₂-CH₃) would also contain a -CH₂- group.\n        *   Therefore, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ is not a valid candidate as any structure consistent with the other data would have to contain a -CH₂- group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectral data, particularly the degrees of unsaturation and the absence of any -CH₂- signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum, the only possible chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
