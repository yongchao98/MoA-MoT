  "question": "You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen.

    "To identify which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to determine which change to the gene sequence would most severely impact the function of the protein it codes for. The most effective mutations for knocking out protein function are those that cause a major disruption, such as a frameshift or a premature stop to protein synthesis.\n\nLet's analyze the impact of each mutation by translating the initial part of its DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets of nucleotides called codons, starting with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`\n    This translates to the amino acid sequence: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine...\n\n*   **Mutant 1 Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    This translates to: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Tyrosine - Alanine...\n    This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid (Leucine) is replaced by another (Tyrosine). This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2 Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    This translates to: Methionine - Phenylalanine - **Stop**\n    This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is one of the three stop codons (along with TGA and TAG) that signals the ribosome to terminate protein synthesis. This mutation causes the creation of a severely shortened protein, containing only two amino acids. A protein this truncated is almost certain to be non-functional, thus eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3 Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...`\n    This translates to: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Tyrosine - Alanine...\n    Similar to Mutant 1, this is a **missense mutation** (Leucine is replaced by Tyrosine). It is not the most likely to completely eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4 Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    This translates to: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Tyrosine - Alanine - Threonine...\n    This sequence contains multiple **missense mutations** (Leucine to Tyrosine and Glycine to Threonine). While multiple changes increase the likelihood of disrupting function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This is the most destructive type of mutation among the choices, as it prevents the full protein from ever being made. Therefore, it is the most likely to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
