    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments and the total kinetic energy release.\n\n*   **Initial rest-mass energy (E_initial):** The problem states the initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`. Converting to Mega-electron volts (MeV) for convenience:\n    `E_initial = 300 GeV = 300,000 MeV`\n\n*   **Final rest-mass energy (E_final_rest):** The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (m1 and m2) is 99% of the initial mass M.\n    `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is:\n    `E_final_rest = (m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2 = 0.99 * 300,000 MeV = 297,000 MeV`\n\n*   **Individual rest-mass energies:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other (`m1 = 2 * m2`). We can find their individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 297,000 MeV`\n    *   `2*m2c^2 + m2c^2 = 297,000 MeV`\n    *   `3*m2c^2 = 297,000 MeV`\n    *   `m2c^2 = 99,000 MeV`\n    *   `m1c^2 = 2 * 99,000 MeV = 198,000 MeV`\n    The more massive fragment (m1) has a rest-mass energy of 198,000 MeV.\n\n*   **Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):** By conservation of energy, the initial rest-mass energy is converted into the final rest-mass energy plus the kinetic energy of the fragments (T1 + T2).\n    `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n    `Q = 300,000 MeV - 297,000 MeV = 3,000 MeV`\n\n### 2. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction.\n    `|p1_classical| = |p2_classical|`\n*   **Classical Relation:** In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   **Calculating T1_classical:**\n    *   From `p^2 = 2mT`, we can write `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\n    *   `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n    *   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `2 * m2 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`, which simplifies to `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3,000 MeV`.\n    *   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1,000 MeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1 value.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The momenta are still equal in magnitude: `|p1_relativistic| = |p2_relativistic|`.\n*   **Relativistic Relation:** The relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mcÂ²) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc^2`. This gives the useful relation `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   **Calculating T1_relativistic:**\n    *   Since the momenta are equal, `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2c^2)`\n    *   We know `T2 = 3,000 - T1`, `m1c^2 = 198,000 MeV`, and `m2c^2 = 99,000 MeV`.\n    *   Substituting these values:\n        `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198,000) = (3,000 - T1)^2 + 2*(3,000 - T1)*(99,000)`\n    *   Expanding the equation:\n        `T1^2 + 396,000*T1 = (9,000,000 - 6,000*T1 + T1^2) + (594,000,000 - 198,000*T1)`\n    *   Canceling the `T1^2` term from both sides and combining terms:\n        `396,000*T1 = 603,000,000 - 204,000*T1`\n    *   `396,000*T1 + 204,000*T1 = 603,000,000`\n    *   `600,000*T1 = 603,000,000`\n    *   `T1 = 603,000,000 / 600,000 = 1005 MeV`\n    *   The correct (relativistic) kinetic energy is `T1 = 1,005 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Find the difference.\n\n*   **Difference** = (Correct T1) - (Classical T1)\n*   **Difference** = 1,005 MeV - 1,000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
