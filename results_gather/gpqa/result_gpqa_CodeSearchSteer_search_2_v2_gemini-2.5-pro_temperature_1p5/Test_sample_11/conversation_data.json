    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\nThe decay process is:\nPi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n\nGiven:\n*   The pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+), (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+), (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered to have zero rest mass.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n*   **Before decay:** The pion is at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n    E_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n\n*   **After decay:** The total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu). The total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and its rest mass energy (m*c²).\n    E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n    E_final = (KE_μ + m_μ*c²) + (KE_ν + m_ν*c²)\n\n    Since the neutrino's rest mass is assumed to be zero (m_ν = 0), its energy is purely kinetic (E_ν = KE_ν).\n\n*   **Equating initial and final energies:**\n    m_π*c² = KE_μ + m_μ*c² + KE_ν\n    139.6 MeV = KE_μ + 105.7 MeV + KE_ν\n    KE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n    **KE_μ + KE_ν = 33.9 MeV** (This is the total kinetic energy released in the decay)\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n*   **Before decay:** The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n    p_initial = 0\n\n*   **After decay:** The muon and the neutrino move off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    p_final = p_μ + p_ν\n    0 = p_μ + p_ν  =>  p_μ = -p_ν\n\n    The magnitudes are equal: |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\nE² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²\n\n*   **For the neutrino (massless):**\n    E_ν² = (p*c)² + (0)²\n    E_ν = p*c\n    Since E_ν = KE_ν, we have **KE_ν = p*c**.\n\n*   **For the muon:**\n    E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    (KE_μ + m_μ*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\n**4. Solving for the Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe can substitute KE_ν for p*c in the muon's energy equation:\n(KE_μ + m_μ*c²)² = (KE_ν)² + (m_μ*c²)²\nKE_μ² + 2*KE_μ*(m_μ*c²) + (m_μ*c²)² = KE_ν² + (m_μ*c²)²\nKE_μ² + 2*KE_μ*(m_μ*c²) = KE_ν²\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  KE_μ + KE_ν = 33.9 MeV  =>  KE_ν = 33.9 - KE_μ\n2.  KE_ν² = KE_μ² + 2*KE_μ*(m_μ*c²)\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n(33.9 - KE_μ)² = KE_μ² + 2 * KE_μ * (105.7)\n(33.9)² - 2*(33.9)*KE_μ + KE_μ² = KE_μ² + 211.4*KE_μ\n1149.21 - 67.8*KE_μ = 211.4*KE_μ\n1149.21 = 211.4*KE_μ + 67.8*KE_μ\n1149.21 = 279.2*KE_μ\nKE_μ = 1149.21 / 279.2\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**\n\nNow, find the neutrino's kinetic energy using equation (1):\nKE_ν = 33.9 - KE_μ\nKE_ν = 33.9 - 4.12\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.78 MeV** (which rounds to 29.8 MeV)\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon and the neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
