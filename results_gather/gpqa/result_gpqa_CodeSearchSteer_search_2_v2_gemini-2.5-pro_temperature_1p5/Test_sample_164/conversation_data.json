    "Here is an analysis of each statement to determine its accuracy:\n\n*   **A) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.** This statement is correct. The industrial production of specific alpha-olefins, like 1-hexene from ethylene, is achieved using chromium-based catalysts. Chromium (Cr) is a Group VIa (also known as Group 6) transition metal. The landmark Chevron Phillips Chemical process uses a chromium catalyst system for the selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene. This 1-hexene can then be used as a comonomer to introduce regular butyl branches into the polyethylene chain. This selective oligomerization is the key reaction needed to produce a polymer with regular branches from a single ethylene feedstock.\n\n*   **B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.** This statement is incorrect. The essential additional step is the selective oligomerization of ethylene to create the alpha-olefin branches. The well-established chromium-based catalyst systems for this reaction, such as the Chevron Phillips process, explicitly use aluminum-based compounds as activators or cocatalysts. For example, triethylaluminium (TEAL) is commonly used.\n\n*   **C) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.** This statement is also correct. Univation Technologies, a joint venture of US-based Dow and ExxonMobil, licenses the UNIPOL™ PE Process, which can use PRODIGY™ Bimodal Catalysts. These are described as multi-component catalyst systems that operate in a single reactor to produce bimodal high-density polyethylene (HDPE). This process involves the in-situ generation of comonomers from ethylene by one catalyst component and their incorporation into the polymer by another, which matches the user's scenario. Univation has catalyst manufacturing facilities in North America and their technology is used by major producers.\n\n*   **D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.** This statement is correct. Research has shown that noble metal catalysts, particularly those based on palladium (Pd), can oligomerize ethylene. However, noble metals are significantly more expensive than transition metals like chromium or nickel, making them economically impractical for the large-scale, commodity production of polyethylene.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatements A, C, and D are factually correct, while B is incorrect. However, the question asks to identify the *single* correct statement, implying one is the best or most relevant answer.\n\n*   Statement A describes the fundamental chemistry and the specific type of catalyst required to achieve the desired selective oligomerization, which is the core of the scientist's problem.\n*   Statement C confirms the industrial viability of the entire integrated process.\n*   Statement D provides a correct but secondary point about an economically unattractive alternative.\n\nBoth A and C are strong, correct statements describing the technology. However, Statement A addresses the specific chemical component—the type of catalyst for the branching reaction—which is a direct and fundamental answer to the scientist's query about methodology. The industrial implementation (Statement C) is built upon the chemical principle described in Statement A. Therefore, A is the most precise and foundational correct statement regarding the chemistry involved.\n\n<<<A>>>"
