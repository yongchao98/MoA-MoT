    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs in molecules that lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and often contain one or more chiral centers. A specific enantiomer designated with (R) or (S) notation is, by definition, optically active. However, molecules with multiple chiral centers can be achiral if they have an internal plane of symmetry; such compounds are called meso compounds.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a double bond and the atoms involved in it lie in a plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n*   ***(3aR,7aS,E)*-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (R and S), indicating that it is a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule. A single enantiomer is optically **active**.\n*   ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and thus optically **inactive**.\n*   ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. It possesses two chiral centers and lacks a plane of symmetry, making it a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound, and they are not superimposable. As a single enantiomer, it is optically **active**.\n*   ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The designation (R) specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group is a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups. Therefore, this compound is optically **active**.\n*   ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The 'cis' or 's' notation indicates that the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This symmetrical arrangement means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. As an achiral compound, it is optically **inactive**.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The most plausible structure for this name is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. An analysis of this structure reveals no chiral centers and a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<A>>>"
