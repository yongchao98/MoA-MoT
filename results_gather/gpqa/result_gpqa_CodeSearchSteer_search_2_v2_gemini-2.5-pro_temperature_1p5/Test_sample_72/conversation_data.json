    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate two quantities: the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system, using principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nThe classical way to find the relative speed would be to simply subtract the two speeds (0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c). However, at relativistic speeds, we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula. The formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) between two objects moving in the same direction with velocities v_A and v_B in a stationary frame is:\n\nv_rel = (v_A - v_B) / (1 - (v_A * v_B) / c²)\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut (v_A) = 0.6c\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut (v_B) = 0.5c\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Total Energy (E_total)\n\nThe total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where 'γ' (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, 'm' is the rest mass, and 'c' is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts (E_total = E_A + E_B).\n\n**Astronaut A:**\n*   Mass (m_A) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v_A) = 0.6c\n*   Lorentz factor (γ_A):\n    γ_A = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Energy (E_A):\n    E_A = γ_A * m_A * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = **2.5 mc²**\n\n**Astronaut B:**\n*   Mass (m_B) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v_B) = 0.5c\n*   Lorentz factor (γ_B):\n    γ_B = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 = 1 / (√3 / 2) = 2 / √3 ≈ 1.1547\n*   Energy (E_B):\n    E_B = γ_B * m_B * c² = (2 / √3) * (3m) * c² = (6 / √3) mc² = 2√3 mc²\n    E_B ≈ 2 * 1.732 * mc² ≈ **3.464 mc²**\n\n**Total System Energy:**\n*   E_total = E_A + E_B = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = **5.964 mc²**\n\nThe calculated values are v_rel ≈ 0.14c and E_total ≈ 5.96 mc².\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc²\n*   B) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc²\n*   C) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc²\n*   D) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc²\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
