    "This problem deals with the principles of electrostatic shielding by a conductor.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge, `-q`, on the inner surface of the cavity. This occurs to ensure the electric field within the bulk of the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** Since the conductor was initially neutral, to maintain its overall charge neutrality, a positive charge `+q` must appear on its outer surface.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the absence of any other external electric fields, and because the conductor is spherical, this induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface of the spherical conductor. The arrangement of the charge *inside* the cavity does not affect the distribution of the charge on the *outer* surface. This phenomenon is known as electrostatic shielding; the conductor isolates the outside region from the influence of the charge inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere. In this case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor, is the same as the field from a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at a distance `L` from a point charge `q` is given by:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances `l` (distance from the cavity's center to P), `s` (distance from conductor's center to cavity's center), and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
