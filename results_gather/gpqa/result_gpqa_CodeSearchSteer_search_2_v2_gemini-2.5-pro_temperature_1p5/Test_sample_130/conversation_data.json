    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This high symmetry (two equivalent alkene protons, two equivalent alkene carbons, two equivalent carbonyl carbons) and the spectral data are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. In this molecule, the four carbons of the diene system (C1-C4) each bear a methyl group, and C5 is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n    *   Since the dienophile can approach the diene from two different faces, two diastereomeric products are formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored and therefore the **major product**, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamically favored and often the **minor product**.\n\n3.  **Structure of the Products and Proton Assignments:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core with the following substituents:\n        *   Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Being on saturated carbons, they will be upfield, around **~1 ppm**.\n        *   Two methyl groups on the double bond (C5 and C6). These are also equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Vinyl methyl groups are deshielded compared to alkyl methyls, so their shift will be around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   Two protons on the fused anhydride ring (at C2 and C3). These protons are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups and located on the rigid bicyclic system, placing their chemical shift downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   Two protons on the C7 methylene bridge. These are diastereotopic and will give rise to two separate signals, each integrating to 1H. They are coupled only to each other (geminal coupling), so they would appear as two doublets (or an AB quartet). The chemical shift for these is typically around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are coupled through bonds.\n    *   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* adduct but not in the *exo* adduct.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C5=C6 double bond of the bicyclic system. This brings the anhydride protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) very close to the vinyl methyl groups (the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C5=C6 double bond. The distance between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl groups is now much larger, and the corresponding NOESY cross-peak will be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The specific NOESY cross-peak that distinguishes the major (*endo*) from the minor (*exo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments, this corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n    *   Matching this with the given options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton).\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons).\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons).\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls).\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
