    "A textile dye that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV will absorb red light. The color of light that a substance absorbs is complementary to the color of light it emits.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  **Determine the color of the emitted light:** First, the energy of the emitted light is used to calculate its wavelength. The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is given by the formula E = hc/λ, where 'h' is Planck's constant and 'c' is the speed of light. A simplified and useful version of this formula is λ (in nanometers) ≈ 1240 / E (in electron volts).\n\n    Using this formula:\n    λ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\n    A wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the green region of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\n2.  **Determine the color of the absorbed light:** When a substance appears a certain color, it is because it is reflecting or emitting those wavelengths of light, while absorbing the complementary color. The color wheel shows that the complementary color to green is red. A substance that absorbs red light will appear green to an observer.\n\nTherefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<D>>>"
