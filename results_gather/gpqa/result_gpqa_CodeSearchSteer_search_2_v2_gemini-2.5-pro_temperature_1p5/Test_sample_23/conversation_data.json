    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CₙHₘ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(m * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + m * 1.008) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This simplifies to a molar ratio of `m/n ≈ 2`. The formula for Z is therefore of the type (CH₂)ₙ or CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Substance Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Its hydrogen mass fraction is `(12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / 84.162 = 0.1437`, which is approximately 14.3%, matching the given value. Thus, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Characterize Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This implies the components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react with bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both components of Y yields only cyclohexane. Therefore, the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon ring structure.\n    *   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water but is not saturated (as it hydrogenates), it must be aromatic. The only aromatic C₆ hydrocarbon is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water without a catalyst and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Characterize Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturation (carbon-carbon double bonds).\n    *   Upon heating with platinum, mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y ({cyclohexane, benzene}). Disproportionation here refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is reduced and the other is oxidized.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both components of X gives only cyclohexane, meaning both have a C₆ ring carbon skeleton.\n    *   The total number of atoms is conserved in the reaction from X to Y. Let the components of X be A and B. The reaction is:\n        `A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    *   Since the number of atoms is conserved, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of benzene.\n        Total H atoms = H atoms in (C₆H₁₂) + H atoms in (C₆H₆)\n        Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Plausibility:**\n    *   The components of X must be unsaturated cyclohexane derivatives. We need two molecules whose total hydrogen count is 18.\n    *   A logical combination is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds. Cyclohexene fits this. For cyclohexadiene, there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The reaction would be an intermolecular hydrogen transfer:\n        `Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C₆H₆) + Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)`\n    *   In this reaction, cyclohexene is oxidized to benzene, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is reduced to cyclohexane. This is a chemically plausible reaction, often described as a type of Zelinsky catalysis or catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. As determined by the conservation of atoms in the disproportionation reaction, this is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
