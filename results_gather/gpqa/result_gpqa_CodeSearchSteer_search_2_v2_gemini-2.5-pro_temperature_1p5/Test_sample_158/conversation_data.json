    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how to determine the comoving distance to the quasar.\n\n### 1. Identify the Spectral Feature and Calculate Redshift (z)\n\nThe observation of a spectral peak at 790 nm with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths is a classic indicator of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line in a high-redshift object. The drop is caused by the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium, known as the Lyman-alpha forest.\n\nThe rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition is approximately 121.6 nm (or 1215.67 Å). The redshift (z) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n*   *1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest*\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   *1 + z = 790 nm / 121.6 nm*\n*   *1 + z ≈ 6.497*\n*   *z ≈ 5.5*\n\nSo, the quasar is at a redshift of approximately 5.5.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Comoving Distance\n\nThe comoving distance is a measure of the distance between two objects that accounts for the expansion of the universe. For a flat ΛCDM universe, as specified in the problem, the comoving distance (D_C) is calculated by integrating over redshift. The formula is:\n\n*   D_C = (c / H₀) ∫ [from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')\nwhere:\n*   E(z') = sqrt(Ω_m(1+z')³ + Ω_Λ)\n\nThe parameters given are:\n*   **H₀ (Hubble constant):** 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   **Ω_m (Matter density parameter):** 0.3\n*   **Ω_Λ (Dark energy density parameter):** 0.7\n*   **z (redshift):** 5.5\n*   The universe is flat, which is consistent with Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1.0.\n\nUsing a cosmological calculator with these parameters provides the most direct and accurate result. For a redshift of z = 5.5, H₀ = 70, Ω_m = 0.3, and Ω_Λ = 0.7, the comoving radial distance is calculated to be approximately **8987.8 Mpc**.\n\n### 3. Convert to Gigaparsecs (Gpc) and Compare\n\nThe final step is to convert the result from Megaparsecs (Mpc) to Gigaparsecs (Gpc) and compare with the given options.\n\n*   1 Gpc = 1000 Mpc\n*   8987.8 Mpc ≈ 8.99 Gpc\n\nThis value is extremely close to 9 Gpc.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the calculated comoving distance of approximately 8.99 Gpc to the options provided:\n*   A) 6 Gpc\n*   B) 8 Gpc\n*   C) 9 Gpc\n*   D) 7 Gpc\n\nThe closest value is 9 Gpc.\n\n<<<C>>>"
