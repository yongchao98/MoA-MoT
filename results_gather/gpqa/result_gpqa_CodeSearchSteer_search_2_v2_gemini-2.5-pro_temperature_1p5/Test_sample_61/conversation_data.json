    "The correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane is given by option A. Let's break down the multi-step synthesis to understand why.\n\nThe target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, is an aldol addition product. Specifically, it is the result of the self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The core challenge of the synthesis is to convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which can then undergo this aldol reaction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Alkylation of Ethynylcyclohexane (1. NaNH2, methyl chloride)**\n    *   The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (C₆H₁₁C≡CH), a terminal alkyne.\n    *   Sodium amide (NaNH₂) is a strong base that deprotonates the terminal alkyne, forming a sodium acetylide salt (C₆H₁₁C≡C⁻Na⁺).\n    *   This acetylide anion then acts as a nucleophile, reacting with methyl chloride (CH₃Cl) in an Sₙ2 reaction to form 1-cyclohexylpropyne (C₆H₁₁C≡C-CH₃). This step effectively adds a methyl group to the alkyne chain.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Partial Hydrogenation (2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate)**\n    *   The internal alkyne, 1-cyclohexylpropyne, is reduced to an alkene using a Lindlar catalyst (H₂/Pd-CaCO₃).\n    *   Lindlar's catalyst is a \"poisoned\" catalyst that is selective for the hydrogenation of alkynes to *cis* (or Z)-alkenes, preventing further reduction to an alkane.\n    *   This step yields (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene (C₆H₁₁CH=CHCH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Ozonolysis (3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S)**\n    *   The alkene is cleaved at the double bond using ozonolysis (O₃) with a reductive workup using dimethyl sulfide ((CH₃)₂S).\n    *   This reaction splits the C=C bond, replacing it with two C=O bonds, to yield two different aldehyde products: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₆H₁₁CHO) and acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Aldol Addition (4. Ba(OH)₂)**\n    *   Barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂) is a base used to catalyze the aldol reaction.\n    *   In the mixture of aldehydes, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde undergoes a self-condensation reaction. An enolate is formed by deprotonating the α-carbon of one molecule, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule.\n    *   This addition reaction results in the formation of the target β-hydroxy aldehyde, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Although aldol reactions involving cyclohexanecarbaldehyde can be challenging due to steric hindrance, this pathway is chemically sound for forming the specified product type.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **Option B:** Ozonolysis with an oxidative workup (O₃/H₂O) would produce carboxylic acids, not the required aldehyde for the aldol step.\n*   **Option C:** Methanol would react with NaNH₂ in an acid-base reaction, preventing the desired alkylation of the alkyne.\n*   **Option D:** Full hydrogenation (H₂/Pd) would produce an alkane, which cannot be converted into the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
