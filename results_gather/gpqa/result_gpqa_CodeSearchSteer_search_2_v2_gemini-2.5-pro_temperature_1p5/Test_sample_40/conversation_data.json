    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Here is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.**\n    *   Let the laboratory be the stationary frame of reference, which we'll call S.\n    *   Let the moving glass be the other frame of reference, which we'll call S'.\n\n2.  **Define the velocities.**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass (S'), is `u'`. The refractive index `n` is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). Given that the speed of light in a vacuum `c` is set to 1, we have `n = 1 / u'`, which means `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   We want to find the speed of the light beam in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory (frame S). Let's call this `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Einstein velocity addition formula.**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the specific values from the problem into the formula.**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these gives:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n * v) / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches the one famously confirmed by the Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water.\n\nComparing our result with the given choices:\n\nA) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nB) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nC) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated speed matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
