    "The derivation seems correct. The search results confirm that for a double-lined spectroscopic binary, Kepler's Third Law can be expressed in terms of the period and the velocities of the stars. Since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume the inclination angle `i` is close to 90 degrees, making `sin(i)` approximately 1. This is a key assumption that allows for a direct calculation.\n\nThe total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the period (P) and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 + K2) by the formula:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\nLet's re-calculate the ratio of the masses of the two systems using this relationship.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Eclipse Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Eclipse Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system 1 (M1) to the mass of system 2 (M2) is:\n\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K_sum1)³] / [P2 * (K_sum2)³]\nM1 / M2 = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is closest to 0.4.\n\nTherefore, system 1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system 2.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\". This phrasing could be ambiguous. It could mean \"how many times more massive\", in which case the answer would be 0.432. Or it could be interpreted differently, but given the multiple-choice options, a direct ratio is expected. The calculation is robust.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nRatio = (P1/P2) * ((K1a+K1b)/(K2a+K2b))^3\nRatio = (2/1) * ((10+5)/(15+10))^3\nRatio = 2 * (15/25)^3\nRatio = 2 * (0.6)^3\nRatio = 2 * 0.216\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThe result of ~0.432 is consistent and the closest answer is D.\n\nTo find the relative mass of two binary star systems, we can use a formulation derived from Kepler's Third Law, which relates the total mass of a system to its orbital period and the velocities of its components. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where the radial velocities of both stars can be measured, the total mass (M) is proportional to the orbital period (P) and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ + K₂).\n\nThe formula is: M ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nSince both systems are described as exhibiting eclipses, it is reasonable to assume that their orbital planes are viewed edge-on (inclination angle i ≈ 90°), which allows for this direct comparison.\n\n**Data for System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₁ₐ, K₁ᵦ): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of Amplitudes (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**Data for System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₂ₐ, K₂ᵦ): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of Amplitudes (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nTo find the factor by which system 1 is more massive than system 2, we calculate the ratio of their masses (M₁ / M₂):\n\nRatio = (P₁ * (K_total₁)³) / (P₂ * (K_total₂)³)\nRatio = (2 years * (15 km/s)³) / (1 year * (25 km/s)³)\nRatio = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nRatio = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis result, approximately 0.432, indicates that system 1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
