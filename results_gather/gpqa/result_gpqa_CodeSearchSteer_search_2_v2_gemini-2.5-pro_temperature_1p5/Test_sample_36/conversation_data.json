    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction series to identify the final product E and determine the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n    *   This reaction protects the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) using BF₃ as a Lewis acid catalyst. This forms a cyclic thioacetal known as a 1,3-dithiane.\n    *   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**\n    *   n-Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in compound A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the sulfur atoms and their ability to stabilize the resulting anion. This type of reactivity, where the polarity of the carbonyl carbon is reversed, is known as \"umpolung\".\n    *   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane carbanion (2-lithio-2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane).\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The carbanion (B) is a potent nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product C:** A second ethyl group is attached to the C2 position, resulting in 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This step is the deprotection of the dithiane group to regenerate a carbonyl group. Reagents like mercury(II) chloride (HgCl₂) are used for this hydrolysis because of the high affinity of Hg²⁺ for sulfur.\n    *   **Product D:** The dithiane is removed, and a ketone is formed. The carbon atom that was part of the dithiane ring is now the carbonyl carbon, attached to the two ethyl groups. The product is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone** ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction, which converts a ketone or aldehyde into an alkene.\n    *   **Ylide formation:** First, the Wittig reagent (a phosphorus ylide) is prepared. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) to form a phosphonium salt. BuLi then deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus atom to form the ylide: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   **Wittig Reaction:** The ylide reacts with the ketone from the previous step, 3-pentanone (D).\n    *   (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₃CH₂)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n    *   **Product E:** The final product is a highly symmetric alkene, **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E\n\nThe structure of the final product E, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is:\n\n```\n        CH₂-CH₃\n        |\nCH₃-CH₂-C=C-CH₂-CH₃\n        |\n        CH₂-CH₃\n```\n\nTo determine the number of signals in the 13C-NMR spectrum, we must identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms. Due to the high degree of symmetry in the molecule, several carbon atoms are chemically equivalent.\n\nThe molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry perpendicular to and passing through the midpoint of the C=C double bond. This symmetry makes the four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's break down the carbons:\n*   **Olefinic carbons (C=C):** The two carbons of the double bond are equivalent due to symmetry. This will produce **one** signal.\n*   **Methylene carbons (-CH₂-):** All four methylene groups of the four identical ethyl groups are equivalent. This will produce **one** signal.\n*   **Methyl carbons (-CH₃):** All four terminal methyl groups of the four identical ethyl groups are equivalent. This will produce **one** signal.\n\nTherefore, despite having a total of 10 carbon atoms, the high symmetry of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene results in only three distinct carbon environments.\n\nThe final product, E, will produce **3** signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
