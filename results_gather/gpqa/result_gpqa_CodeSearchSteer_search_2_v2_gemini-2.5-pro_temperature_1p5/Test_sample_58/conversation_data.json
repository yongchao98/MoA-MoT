    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of acid and base and then determine which, if any, is in excess after the neutralization reactions.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Moles = Volume × Molarity\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n### Step 2: Account for the neutralization reactions.\n\nNeutralization reactions occur in a specific order: strong acids react with strong bases first.\n\n1.  **Strong Acid-Strong Base Reaction:** The H⁺ ions from HCl will react with the OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂.\n    *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of H⁺ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   Since H⁺ is the limiting reactant, all of it will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n2.  **Weak Acid-Strong Base Reaction:** The remaining strong base (OH⁻) will then react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The weak acid (CH₃COOH) is the limiting reactant in this step.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ consumed = 0.050 mol\n    *   Final moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the final solution.\n\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻ ions, which makes it a basic solution. The pH is determined by the concentration of this excess strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
