    "### Reaction 1: Formation of a Cyanohydrin\n\nThe first reaction shows the conversion of butan-2-one (a ketone) to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile using sodium cyanide (NaCN). This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to form a cyanohydrin. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as the nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This creates an alkoxide intermediate. This intermediate must then be protonated to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin. This protonation step requires an acid. Therefore, reagent A must be an acid source, which is represented by H₃O⁺.\n\n### Reaction 2: Hydrolysis of a Nitrile\n\nThe second reaction involves converting 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This transformation is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This reaction can be carried out under either acidic or basic conditions. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis involves heating the nitrile with a strong mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid, in the presence of water. Strong acids are effective reagents for this conversion. Thus, reagent B is a strong acid like HCl.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Reagent A is an acid (H₃O⁺) required for the protonation step in cyanohydrin formation.\n*   Reagent B is a strong acid (HCl) needed for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<B>>>"
