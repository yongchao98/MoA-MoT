    "To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet, we must first establish the geometric conditions that allow for a transit to occur.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Transit Condition:** A planet transits its star when its trajectory takes it between the star and the observer. The degree of alignment is measured by the **impact parameter (b)**, which is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at the point of closest approach, measured in stellar radii. For the center of the planet to pass across the star's disk, the impact parameter must be `b ≤ 1`.\n2.  **Shared Orbital Plane:** Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, they share the same orbital inclination (`i`) with respect to the observer.\n3.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For two planets orbiting the same star, this can be expressed as: `(P2/P1)² = (a2/a1)³`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Relating Inclination and Impact Parameter for Planet 1:**\n    The impact parameter `b1` for the first planet is given by the formula:\n    `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / Rs`\n    We are given `b1 = 0.2`, so we can express the common orbital inclination `i` in terms of the first planet's semi-major axis (`a1`) and the star's radius (`Rs`):\n    `cos(i) = (0.2 * Rs) / a1`\n\n2.  **Determining the Transit Condition for Planet 2:**\n    The impact parameter for the second planet (`b2`) is similarly given by:\n    `b2 = (a2 * cos(i)) / Rs`\n    Since the planets share the same orbital inclination, we can substitute the expression for `cos(i)` from Planet 1:\n    `b2 = a2 / Rs * (0.2 * Rs / a1)`\n    The stellar radius `Rs` cancels out, simplifying the equation to:\n    `b2 = 0.2 * (a2 / a1)`\n\n3.  **Applying the Maximum Transit Condition:**\n    For the second planet to exhibit a transit, its impact parameter `b2` must be less than or equal to 1. To find the maximum orbital period, we consider the maximum possible impact parameter, `b2 = 1`.\n    `1 = 0.2 * (a2 / a1)`\n    Solving for the ratio of the semi-major axes gives the maximum ratio for which a transit can occur:\n    `a2 / a1 = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n\n4.  **Using Kepler's Third Law to Find the Period:**\n    Now we use Kepler's Third Law to relate the ratio of the semi-major axes to the ratio of the orbital periods:\n    `(P2 / P1)² = (a2 / a1)³`\n    Substituting the maximum ratio for `a2 / a1`:\n    `(P2 / 3 days)² = 5³ = 125`\n    Now, we solve for `P2`:\n    `P2² = 125 * (3 days)²`\n    `P2 = sqrt(125) * 3 days`\n    `P2 = 5 * sqrt(5) * 3 days`\n    `P2 ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet to exhibit transit and occultation events is approximately 33.5 days. Note that in this calculation, the radii of the planets and the star are not needed, as the stellar radius cancels out and the problem is solvable by assuming a transit occurs if the planet's center passes over the stellar disk (`b ≤ 1`).\n\n<<<D>>>"
