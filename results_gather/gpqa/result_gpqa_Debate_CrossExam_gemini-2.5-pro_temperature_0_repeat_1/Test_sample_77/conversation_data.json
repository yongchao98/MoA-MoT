    "**Proposer**: The problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge. This is a standard problem in electrodynamics, and the solution is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. I will perform a search to find the standard expressions for these potentials and then match them to the given options, paying close attention to the notation defined in the prompt.\n\n**Skeptic**: The notation is critical here. We have $\\vec{d}$ as the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$, and $\\vec{v}$ is the charge's velocity at $t_r$. The options differ primarily in the denominator, specifically the sign of the $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ term. A simple search might give the formula in a different notation, so careful translation will be necessary. We must confirm the exact form of the denominator, which accounts for the fact that the distance the field information has to travel depends on the charge's motion.\n\n**Decision**: The next action will be to search for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials and their derivation to ensure the correct form of the denominator.\n\n**Proposer**: The search results confirm that the potentials for a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Result provides the scalar potential in a notation very similar to the problem's. It gives the scalar potential as $\\phi(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r| - \\vec{\\beta} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r)}$, where $\\vec{r}_r$ is the retarded position and $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}_r/c$.\n\n**Skeptic**: Let's carefully translate this to the notation given in the question.\n*   The vector from the retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r$, is what the problem calls $\\vec{d}$.\n*   The magnitude $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r|$ is therefore $d$.\n*   The velocity at the retarded time, $\\vec{v}_r$, is what the problem calls $\\vec{v}$.\n*   So, $\\vec{\\beta}$ is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula from the search result:\nThe denominator is $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r| - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r) = d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}$.\nThis can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$.\n\nSo the scalar potential is $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nThis matches the scalar potential in option B.\n\n**Proposer**: Now for the vector potential, $\\vec{A}$. It is well-established that for a single moving point charge, the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Let's apply this to the scalar potential we just found.\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nUsing the relation $c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o \\mu_o}$, we can write $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o c} = \\mu_o c$.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o c q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nThis expression for $\\vec{A}$ matches the one in option B.\n\n**Skeptic**: The derivation seems sound and the translation of notation is correct. The key was identifying the correct form of the denominator, which includes the negative sign. The relationship between $\\vec{A}$ and $V$ is also correctly applied. Both parts of option B have been derived from the standard Liénard-Wiechert potential formulas found in the search results. The other options are incorrect due to either using a static potential form or having the wrong sign in the denominator.\n\n**Conclusion**: The debate converges. Option B correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials in the given notation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
