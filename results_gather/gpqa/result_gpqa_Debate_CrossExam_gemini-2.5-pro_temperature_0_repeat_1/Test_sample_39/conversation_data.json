    "Proposer: The chemist's statement, \"my compounds are on top of each other,\" is a common expression in a synthetic organic chemistry lab. It almost certainly refers to a failed separation attempt using chromatography, a primary technique for purifying compounds. The most common form, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography, separates compounds based on their polarity. If compounds have very similar polarities, they travel at the same rate through the stationary phase, resulting in poor separation. On a TLC plate, this would be visualized as spots that are not resolved and appear \"on top of each other\". Therefore, the chemist is most likely referring to the compounds having similar polarities. This aligns with option D.\n\nSkeptic: While chromatography is a very common technique, it's not the only one. The chemist could have been attempting a distillation, and the compounds have similar boiling points (Option C), causing them to co-distill. This would also be a failed separation. Also, the term \"on top of each other\" could be interpreted literally in the context of stereochemistry, where one might try to superimpose mirror images (Option A). Furthermore, strong intermolecular forces (Option B) could cause compounds to aggregate, although this is less likely to be described in this specific way. The key is the common vernacular in a lab. While similar boiling points are a valid problem, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is most visually and idiomatically descriptive of a TLC plate where the spots have not separated.\n\nDecision: The argument for chromatography is stronger due to the specific phrasing. The visual result of a TLC plate with unseparated compounds is literally spots on top of each other. This is a very frequent challenge and a common way to describe it. The search results confirm that the phrase \"one spot on the other\" or similar is used to describe poor separation in TLC due to close Rf values, which is a function of polarity. Therefore, the most probable answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
