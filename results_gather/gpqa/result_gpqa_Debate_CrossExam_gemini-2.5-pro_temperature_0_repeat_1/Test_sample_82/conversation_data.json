    "### **Proposer's Solution Path**\n\nThe problem requires a two-part calculation to determine the pH at two different points in a titration. First, we must calculate the pH at 25% titration, which is in the buffer region. Second, we need to find the pH at the equivalence point, where all the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Dilution Calculation:** Determine the initial concentration of acetic acid after it has been diluted with water.\n2.  **pKa Calculation:** Calculate the pKa of acetic acid from the given Ka value.\n3.  **pH at 25% Titration:** Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), meaning 75% of the acid remains. The ratio of [A⁻]/[HA] will be 25/75 or 1/3.\n4.  **Equivalence Point Calculation:**\n    *   Determine the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point by calculating the volume of NaOH required to neutralize all the acetic acid.\n    *   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (the conjugate base) at the equivalence point.\n    *   Calculate the Kb for acetate using the relationship Kw = Ka * Kb.\n    *   Set up an equilibrium calculation for the hydrolysis of the acetate ion to find the concentration of OH⁻.\n    *   Calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH.\n\n### **Skeptic's Cross-Examination**\n\nThe proposed plan is logical. However, potential errors could arise from:\n*   **Calculation Errors:** Simple arithmetic or logarithmic mistakes.\n*   **Conceptual Errors:** Forgetting the initial dilution, misinterpreting the ratio for the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, or incorrectly setting up the hydrolysis calculation.\n*   **Formula Application:** Incorrectly applying the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or the formula for Kb.\n\nLet's verify each step of the calculation.\n\n1.  **Dilution:**\n    *   Initial Molarity (M₁) = 0.05 M\n    *   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Final Molarity (M₂) = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n    *   *This step is correct.*\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n    *   At 25% titration, [A⁻]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.\n    *   *This value is very close to 4.26.*\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added equal the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid = 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume at equivalence point = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   At this point, 0.001 mol of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) has been formed.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(Kb * [A⁻]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02) ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   pOH = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n    *   *This value is very close to 8.52.*\n\nThe calculations confirm that the proposer's approach is sound and the results align with one of the options.\n\n### **Decision**\n\nThe debate converges. The initial analysis and calculations are confirmed to be correct. The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n<<<C>>>"
