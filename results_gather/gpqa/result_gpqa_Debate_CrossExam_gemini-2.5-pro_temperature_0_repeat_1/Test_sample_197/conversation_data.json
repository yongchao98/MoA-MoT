    "**Proposer:** The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This can be determined by calculating the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free Co(II) ions and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, and the free thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]`:\n`[Co(SCN)ₙ] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. The `[Co²⁺]` term will cancel out from the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe formula for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (α₂) is:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nMy proposed action is to substitute the given values into this formula and calculate the result. I do not need to perform a search.\n\n**Skeptic:** Your proposed formula is correct for this type of calculation. However, I have some points to consider:\n1.  The problem provides the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, which is not used in your formula. Could this value be important? It might imply that the consumption of the thiocyanate ligand by complex formation is significant, meaning the equilibrium concentration of `[SCN⁻]` is not the stated 0.1 M.\n2.  The notation `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` typically refers to the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand in the solution. If this is the case, your formula is correct, and the total cobalt concentration is extraneous information, possibly included to test understanding.\n3.  Let's assume the standard interpretation that `[SCN⁻]` is the equilibrium concentration. The calculation then depends entirely on the correct application of the formula and accurate arithmetic. A small error could lead to selecting the wrong multiple-choice option.\n\n**Decision:** The most standard and direct interpretation of the problem is that `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` is the equilibrium concentration of the free thiocyanate ligand. In this scenario, the Proposer's formula is the correct path forward. The total cobalt concentration is not needed to calculate the percentage distribution of the species. The next and final action is to perform the calculation.\n\nLet's calculate the denominator (D) of the fraction:\nD = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator (N), which corresponds to the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex term:\nN = β₂ * [SCN⁻]²\nN = 40 * (0.1)²\nN = 0.4\n\nThe fraction (α₂) is N / D:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
