    # --- Problem Parameters ---
    # The problem provides the following values:
    # Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10^-2 M (This is not needed if we assume [SCN-] is the equilibrium concentration)
    # Thiocyanate concentration, [SCN-] = 0.1 M
    # Stability constants:
    beta1 = 9
    beta2 = 40
    beta3 = 63
    beta4 = 16

    # --- Answer to be Checked ---
    # The provided answer is D, which corresponds to 16.9%.
    expected_percentage = 16.9

    # --- Calculation ---
    # The fraction of a specific complex, α_n, is given by the formula:
    # α_n = (β_n * [L]^n) / (1 + Σ(β_i * [L]^i))
    # where L is the ligand (SCN-) and n is the number of ligands.
    # We need to find the percentage for the n=2 complex, [Co(SCN)₂].

    # Let's define the ligand concentration for clarity
    scn_conc = 0.1

    # Calculate the denominator of the fraction. This is the sum of the relative
    # amounts of all cobalt-containing species (with [Co²⁺] factored out).
    # The '1' represents the free Co²⁺ ion (β₀ = 1).
