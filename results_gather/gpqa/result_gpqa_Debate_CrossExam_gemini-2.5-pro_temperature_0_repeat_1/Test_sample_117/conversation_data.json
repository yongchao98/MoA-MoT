    "The reaction between an enol and bromine is a classic example of alpha-halogenation of a ketone, where the enol acts as a nucleophilic intermediate. The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, has a double bond between the C1 and C2 positions, with the hydroxyl group attached to C1.\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  The electron-rich double bond of the enol attacks a bromine molecule (Br₂), which is an electrophile.\n2.  The pi electrons of the double bond form a new bond between C2 and a bromine atom.\n3.  To restore the carbonyl group, the lone pair of electrons on the hydroxyl's oxygen atom forms a double bond with C1. This is accompanied by the loss of a proton (H⁺) from the hydroxyl group.\n\nThis sequence of steps results in the formation of a ketone with a bromine atom on the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). In this case, the carbonyl group is formed at C1, and the bromine atom is attached to C2. The dimethyl groups at position 4 are unaffected by the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. The other options are incorrect:\n*   A) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone would involve substitution at the wrong carbon.\n*   C) and D) represent di-bromo alcohol products. While addition across the double bond is a possibility for alkenes, the enol functional group strongly favors rearrangement to the more stable ketone, making the α-bromoketone the major outcome.\n\n<<<B>>>"
