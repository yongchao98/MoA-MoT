    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for the given conditions.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus X\n\nThe problem states that nucleus X is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   The number of neutrons (N) is given as 3.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus X is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n### 2. Determine the Rest Mass of the Lithium-6 Nucleus\n\nTo find the energy, we first need the rest mass (m₀) of the Lithium-6 nucleus. This can be calculated by summing the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons. Using precise values for the masses of a proton and a neutron is crucial for accuracy.\n\n*   **Mass of a proton (mₚ):** 938.272 MeV/c²\n*   **Mass of a neutron (mₙ):** 939.565 MeV/c²\n\nThe rest mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus is the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Note that this calculation does not account for the nuclear binding energy, which makes the actual nucleus slightly lighter. However, this method is a standard approach for such problems.\n\n*   **Rest mass energy of the nucleus (m₀c²):**\n    m₀c² = (3 * mₚc²) + (3 * mₙc²)\n    m₀c² = (3 * 938.272 MeV) + (3 * 939.565 MeV)\n    m₀c² = 2814.816 MeV + 2818.695 MeV\n    m₀c² = 5633.511 MeV\n\nConverting this to Giga-electron Volts (GeV):\n*   m₀c² = 5.633511 GeV\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\n\nThe nucleus is traveling at a relativistic speed (v) of 0.96c, where c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n*   **Substitute v = 0.96c:**\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    γ = 1 / √0.0784\n    γ = 1 / 0.28\n    γ = 3.5714\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)\n\nThe question asks for the \"energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)\". In the context of particle accelerators, this typically refers to the total relativistic energy of the accelerated particle, which is given by Einstein's famous equation, E = γm₀c².\n\n*   **Calculate the total energy:**\n    E = γ * m₀c²\n    E = 3.5714 * 5.633511 GeV\n    E ≈ 20.1196 GeV\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\n\nThe calculated total energy is approximately 20.120 GeV. Now, let's compare this with the provided options:\nA) 21.419 GeV\nB) 23.069 GeV\nC) 20.132 GeV\nD) 18.475 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.120 GeV is extremely close to option C, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (about 0.06%) can be attributed to the precision of the physical constants used in the problem's original formulation versus the ones used here.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the RHIC required for the Lithium-6 nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c is 20.132 GeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
