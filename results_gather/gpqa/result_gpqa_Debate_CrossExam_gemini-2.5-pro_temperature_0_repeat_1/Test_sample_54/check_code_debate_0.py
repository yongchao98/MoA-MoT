    # --- Given Data from the Question ---
    # 1H NMR: 7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d)
    # Options: A) Cis-butenyl acetate, B) Trans-propenyl acetate, C) Trans-butenyl acetate, D) Cis-propenyl acetate

    # --- Define the expected correct answer based on analysis ---
    # Analysis Step 1: Check the J-coupling constant for stereochemistry.
    # A J-value of 16.0 Hz is characteristic of vinyl protons in a 'trans' configuration (typically 12-18 Hz).
    # A 'cis' configuration would have a smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz).
    # This eliminates the 'cis' options (A and D).
    j_coupling = 16.0
    if not (12 <= j_coupling <= 18):
        return f"Incorrect. The analysis of J-coupling is flawed. A value of {j_coupling} Hz is expected to be trans."

    # Analysis Step 2: Check the fragmentation pattern for the carbon skeleton.
    # - 2.1 (3H, s): Acetate methyl group (-OCOCH3). Present in all options.
    # - 1.6 (3H, d): A methyl group next to a single proton (CH3-CH=).
    # - 5.5 (1H, dq): A proton coupled to one proton (doublet) and three protons (quartet). This is the =CH- proton coupled to the other vinyl proton and the adjacent methyl group.
    # - 7.0 (1H, d): A proton coupled to one other proton. This is the other vinyl proton.
    # This pattern (CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) perfectly describes a propenyl acetate.
    # A butenyl acetate would have a different pattern:
    #   - 1-butenyl acetate (CH3CH2CH=CHOAc) would show signals for an ethyl group (a triplet and a 2H quartet), which are absent.
    #   - 2-butenyl acetate (CH3CH=CHCH2OAc) would show a -CH2- signal (likely a 2H doublet), which is absent.
    # This eliminates the 'butenyl' options (A and C).
    
    # Conclusion from analysis: The compound must be Trans-propenyl acetate.
