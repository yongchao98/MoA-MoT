    "**Proposer's Initial Analysis:**\n\nThe problem asks to identify the molecular formula of a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its spectral data.\n\n1.  **From the problem statement, we know:**\n    *   It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring, C6H4).\n    *   FTIR shows an ester group (-COO-).\n    *   1H NMR shows:\n        *   Two aromatic-H signals.\n        *   Two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets).\n        *   Two -CH3 signals.\n        *   No -CH2 signals.\n\n2.  **Interpreting the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** This suggests a para (1,4) or ortho (1,2) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** The pattern of a doublet and a doublet of quartets is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet), and the other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One of these is the methyl group from the propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3). The other must be part of the ester functionality, as there are no other places for it.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester group not to have a -CH2- group, it must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), for example, is ruled out.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure and Formula:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring fragment: C6H4.\n    *   We have a propenyl group substituent: -C3H5.\n    *   We have an ester-related substituent that also contains a methyl group. This can be either:\n        *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3, which has the formula -C2H3O2.\n        *   An acetate group: -OCOCH3, which also has the formula -C2H3O2.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the total molecular formula:\n        *   Carbons: 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester part) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens: 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl of ester) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygens: 2 (ester).\n    *   The resulting formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Proposed Action:** The logical deduction seems complete. To be certain, I will perform a search to confirm that the proposed structures (like methyl p-propenylbenzoate or p-propenylphenyl acetate) are consistent with the given data and that no other possibilities for the other formulas exist.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination:**\n\nThe initial deduction to C11H12O2 is strong. The search results provide spectra for related compounds. Let's analyze them to see if they support or contradict the conclusion.\n*   The search did not yield spectra for the exact proposed structures (methyl propenylbenzoate or propenylphenyl acetate).\n*   However, it provided spectra for similar molecules. For example, 3-phenylpropyl acetate (C11H14O2) shows the presence of -CH2- groups in its NMR spectrum, confirming that adding hydrogens to C11H12O2 would introduce these signals, which contradicts the problem statement.\n*   Spectra for methyl benzoate (C8H8O2) and other simple esters are available, but don't directly help confirm the vinyl group signals.\n*   The search on C12H14O2 and C12H12O2 did not reveal any common structures that would fit all the NMR constraints (di-substituted, propenyl group, ester, no -CH2-). For instance, many isomers of C12H14O2 contain -CH2- groups.\n\nThe core of the argument remains the logical deduction from the spectral data:\n*   **Aromatic Ring (C6H4) + Propenyl Group (C3H5) + Ester with a Methyl Group (C2H3O2) = C11H12O2.**\n*   **C11H14O2:** This formula has two more hydrogens. To add two hydrogens to C11H12O2, one would typically saturate the propenyl's double bond, creating a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3). This introduces -CH2- signals, which are explicitly absent. Thus, C11H14O2 is incorrect.\n*   **C12H14O2:** This formula has an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2. This is directly ruled out by the \"no -CH2- signals\" constraint.\n*   **C12H12O2:** This formula has an extra C and the same number of hydrogens as C11H12O2. It is impossible to add a carbon atom without either adding hydrogens (which would change the formula), creating a forbidden -CH2- group (e.g., by making an ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3), or violating another rule (e.g., adding a methyl to the ring would make it tri-substituted; adding a vinyl group to the ester, -COOCH=CH2, would create four vinyl signals instead of two).\n\nThe initial deduction is robust and withstands scrutiny. The constraints provided are very specific and point to a single molecular formula.\n\n**Convergence and Final Decision:**\n\nThe proposer's initial analysis is correct. The combination of a di-substituted benzene ring, an ester group, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, and the absence of any methylene groups can only be satisfied by the molecular formula C11H12O2. The other options are systematically ruled out by the given constraints.\n\n<<<B>>>"
