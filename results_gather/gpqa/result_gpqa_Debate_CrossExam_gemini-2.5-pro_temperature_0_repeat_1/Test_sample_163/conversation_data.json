    "Proposer: The goal is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M1/M2). For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass (M = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2) by the following equation:\n\n(m1 + m2) * sin³(i) = P * (K1 + K2)³ / (2πG)\n\nwhere 'i' is the orbital inclination and 'G' is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both systems are described as having eclipses, it is a standard and reasonable assumption that their orbital inclination 'i' is close to 90°, which means sin(i) is approximately 1. Therefore, the sin³(i) term can be considered equal for both systems and will cancel out when we compute the ratio of their masses. The term 2πG is a constant and will also cancel out.\n\nThis simplifies the ratio of the total masses to:\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\nI will now perform a search to confirm this relationship.\n\nSkeptic: The approach seems sound, assuming the formula is correct. The primary assumption is that sin³(i) is effectively the same for both systems because they are both eclipsing. While there could be minor differences in their inclinations, without further information, this is the most logical assumption. The cancellation of units also appears correct. The next logical step is to verify the formula before proceeding with the calculation.\n\nDecide next action: I will perform a Google search to confirm the formula for determining the total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system.Proposer: The search results confirm the underlying physics. Specifically, result mentions that for an eclipsing binary, the inclination can be determined, which in turn allows for the calculation of the individual and total masses. Result reinforces that for a double-line detached eclipsing binary (DDEB), the masses of the companions are determinable. The problem states these are eclipsing systems, which justifies our assumption that sin(i) ≈ 1 for both. The mass ratio is given by K1/K2, and the total mass involves the sum of the velocities. My proposed formula, M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³, appears to be correct based on the principles outlined in the search results. I am ready to proceed with the calculation.\n\nSkeptic: The search confirms that for double-lined eclipsing binaries, the masses can be determined. The key relationship relies on Kepler's third law and the Doppler shifts. The formula for the total mass, M_total = (P / (2πG sin³(i))) * (K1 + K2)³, is standard. Given the problem's constraints (eclipsing systems), the assumption i ≈ 90° is justified. The path is clear.\n\nDecide next action: The formula and the approach have been validated. The next and final step is to substitute the given values into the ratio formula and calculate the result.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe ratio of the total masses is given by:\nM_system1 / M_system2 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³)\n\n**Given values:**\n*   P1 = 2 years\n*   K1a = 10 km/s\n*   K1b = 5 km/s\n*   P2 = 1 year\n*   K2a = 15 km/s\n*   K2b = 10 km/s\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes for each system.**\n*   K_total1 = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   K_total2 = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the values into the ratio formula.**\n*   M1 / M2 = (2 years * (15 km/s)³) / (1 year * (25 km/s)³)\n\nThe units (years and km/s) will cancel out.\n*   M1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n*   M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n*   M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n*   M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n*   M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis result is approximately 0.4.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 0.7\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.4\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
