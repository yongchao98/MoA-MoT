    "**Proposer:** The initial analysis suggests that the planet with 5 times the mass of Earth and the same composition will be the densest due to gravitational compression. The search results confirm that for rocky planets, density increases with mass. Specifically, gravity compresses the material of a planet, increasing its density. More massive planets experience greater gravitational compression. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with Earth-like composition will be denser than Earth.\n\n**Skeptic:** I agree with the general principle. However, we need to be certain that the increase in density for planet (c) is significant enough to make it the densest among the choices. Planet (a) has a density of about 5.51 g/cm³. Planet (b) is stated to have a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Planet (d), being less massive, will be less dense than Earth. The key is to confirm that the density of planet (c) will be greater than ~5.5 g/cm³. The search results include a diagram showing the density profiles of super-Earths, indicating that a 5-Earth-mass planet with an Earth-like composition has a higher density than a 1-Earth-mass planet. Another source also indicates that as rocky planets get more massive, they become denser.\n\n**Decision:** The information gathered is sufficient. The consensus is that a more massive planet with the same composition will be denser due to gravitational compression. Therefore, the 5-Earth-mass planet will have the highest density.\n\n<<<answer content>>>\nD"
