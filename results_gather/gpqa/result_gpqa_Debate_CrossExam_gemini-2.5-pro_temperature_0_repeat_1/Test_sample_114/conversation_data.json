    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Define the System and Conservation Laws**\n\nThe problem involves an electron-positron annihilation, which must obey the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. We will analyze the system before and after the collision. The rest energy of an electron (and a positron) is denoted as `mc²`, which has a value of approximately 0.511 MeV.\n\n**2. Initial State (Before Annihilation)**\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_e) = 4\n    *   Total energy (E_e) is given by the relativistic energy formula E = γmc².\n        *   E_e = 4 * mc²\n    *   The momentum (p) can be found using the energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n        *   (p_e * c)² = E_e² - (mc²)² = (4mc²)² - (mc²)² = 15(mc²)²\n        *   p_e * c = √15 * mc²\n    *   Since the electron moves from the left, its momentum is in the positive x-direction.\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_p) = 2\n    *   Total energy (E_p) = 2 * mc²\n    *   Momentum (p_p):\n        *   (p_p * c)² = E_p² - (mc²)² = (2mc²)² - (mc²)² = 3(mc²)²\n        *   p_p * c = √3 * mc²\n    *   Since the positron moves from the right, its momentum is in the negative x-direction.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   Total Energy (E_initial) = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²\n    *   Total Momentum (P_initial) = p_e + p_p = (√15 * mc²/c) - (√3 * mc²/c) = (√15 - √3) * mc²/c along the x-axis.\n\n**3. Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\n*   The final state consists of two photons.\n*   It is given that the photons have equal energy. Let the energy of each photon be E_ph.\n*   From the conservation of energy:\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   6mc² = E_ph + E_ph = 2 * E_ph\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is E_ph = 3mc².\n*   For a photon, the magnitude of its momentum is related to its energy by p = E/c.\n    *   p_ph = E_ph / c = 3mc²/c.\n*   The photons move away at angles to the horizontal axis. Since one moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\", and the initial momentum had no vertical (y-axis) component, their vertical momenta must be equal and opposite. This means they are emitted at the same angle θ relative to the horizontal axis, one above and one below.\n\n**4. Applying Momentum Conservation**\n\n*   The total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum.\n    *   P_final = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ)\n*   Now, we set the initial momentum equal to the final momentum:\n    *   P_initial = P_final\n    *   (√15 - √3) * mc²/c = 2 * (3mc²/c) * cos(θ)\n*   We can cancel the `mc²/c` term from both sides:\n    *   √15 - √3 = 6 * cos(θ)\n*   Solving for cos(θ):\n    *   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\n**5. Calculating the Angle**\n\n*   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    *   √15 ≈ 3.873\n    *   √3 ≈ 1.732\n    *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n*   We find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos):\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n*   The question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\n    *   Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<B>>>"
