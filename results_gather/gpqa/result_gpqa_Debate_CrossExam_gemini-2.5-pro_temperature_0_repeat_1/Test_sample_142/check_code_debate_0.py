def check_pinacol_rearrangement_answer():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for two
    Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement reactions.

    The logic is based on the fundamental principles of the reaction:
    1.  Formation of the most stable carbocation after protonation of a hydroxyl group.
    2.  Migration of a group (1,2-shift) from an adjacent carbon to the carbocation.
    3.  The migratory aptitude follows the general order: Hydride (H) > Aryl > Alkyl.
    4.  In cyclic systems, this can lead to ring expansion or contraction.

    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # Reaction 1: A + H2SO4 ---> 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one

    # --- Verification for Reaction 1 ---
    # Starting material A: 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol
    # This is a vicinal diol with one -OH on a cyclopentane ring (C_ring) and
    # the other on an adjacent side-chain carbon (C_side).
    
    # Step 1.1: Determine the most stable carbocation.
    # - Removing -OH from C_ring (tertiary) gives a tertiary carbocation.
    # - Removing -OH from C_side (tertiary) gives a tertiary carbocation that is
    #   also benzylic, stabilized by resonance with two p-tolyl groups.
    # Conclusion: The carbocation forms on the side-chain carbon (C_side).
    carbocation_on_side_chain = True

    # Step 1.2: Determine the rearrangement.
    # The carbocation is on C_side. A group from the adjacent C_ring must migrate.
    # The migration of a C-C bond from the cyclopentane ring to C_side will
    # result in ring expansion.

        final_ring_size = 5

    # Step 1.3: Predict the final product structure.
    # - The ring becomes a 6-membered (cyclohexane) ring.
    # - The original C_side, with its two p-tolyl groups, is now part of the ring.
    # - The positive charge moves to the original C_ring, which still has its -OH group.
    # - Deprotonation of this -OH forms a ketone (C=O).
    # - The resulting product is a cyclohexanone where the carbon adjacent to the
    #   ketone has two p-tolyl groups.

    # --- Verification for Reaction 2 ---
    # Starting material: methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate
    # This is a vicinal diol on C2 and C3 of a butanoate chain.
    # C2: tertiary, attached to -OH, p-tolyl, C1(ester), C3.
    # C3: secondary, attached to -OH, H, C2, C4(methyl).

    # Step 2.1: Determine the most stable carbocation.
    # - Removing -OH from C2 gives a tertiary carbocation.
    # - Removing -OH from C3 gives a secondary carbocation.
    # Conclusion: The tertiary carbocation at C2 is more stable and will form.

    # Step 2.2: Determine the migrating group.
    # The carbocation is at C2. A group from the adjacent C3 must migrate.
    # The groups on C3 are a Hydrogen (H) and a methyl group (CH3).
    # Migratory aptitude is H > alkyl (CH3).
    # Conclusion: The hydride (H) migrates.
    migrating_group = "H"

    # Step 2.3: Predict the final product structure.
    # - Hydride migrates from C3 to C2.
    # - The positive charge moves to C3.
    # - The -OH on C3 is deprotonated to form a ketone.
    # - The final structure has a ketone at C3, a p-tolyl group at C2, and a methyl ester at C1.
