    Checks the correctness of the volume integral of the divergence of the field f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat.

    According to the Divergence Theorem, this volume integral is equal to the flux of the field
    through the surface of the sphere of radius R. This method avoids the singularity of the field
    at the origin.

    The flux is given by the surface integral: ∬_S (f ⋅ dS).
    On the surface of the sphere (r=R):
    - f = (1/R^2) * r_hat
    - dS = r_hat * R^2 * sin(theta) dθ dφ
    - f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(theta) dθ dφ = sin(theta) dθ dφ

    We integrate this over the surface of the sphere:
    - θ (polar angle) from 0 to π
    - φ (azimuthal angle) from 0 to 2π
