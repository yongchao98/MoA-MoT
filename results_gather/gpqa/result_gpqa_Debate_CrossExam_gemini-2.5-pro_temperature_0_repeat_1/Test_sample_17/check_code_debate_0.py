    # --- Calculation ---
    # The goal is to find the ratio of silicon atoms, which is interpreted as the ratio
    # of silicon abundance fractions relative to hydrogen: Ratio = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2.
    # The key formula derived from the definition of [A/B] is:
    # log10(Ratio) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2

    # Step 1: Calculate [Si/H] for Star 1 using the additive property [A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C].
    # [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1
    Si_H_1 = Si_Fe_1 + Fe_H_1

    # Step 2: Calculate [Si/H] for Star 2.
    # First, use the property [A/B] = -[B/A] to find [Si/Mg]_2.
    # [Si/Mg]_2 = -[Mg/Si]_2
    Si_Mg_2 = -Mg_Si_2
    # Then, use the additive property again: [Si/H]_2 = [Si/Mg]_2 + [Mg/H]_2
    Si_H_2 = Si_Mg_2 + Mg_H_2

    # Step 3: Calculate the logarithm of the final ratio.
    log_ratio = Si_H_1 - Si_H_2

    # Step 4: Calculate the final ratio by taking the antilog.
    calculated_ratio = 10**log_ratio

    # --- Verification ---
    # Find which option is numerically closest to the calculated ratio.
