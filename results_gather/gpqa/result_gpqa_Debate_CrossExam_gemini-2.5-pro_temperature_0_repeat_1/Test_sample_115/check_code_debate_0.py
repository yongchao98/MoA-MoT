    # Question constraint: Proton NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H.
    # This 6H:4H (or 3:2) ratio with triplet/quartet splitting is the classic signature for two equivalent ethyl groups (-CH2-CH3).
    # The simplest symmetrical molecule fitting this is n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3).
    # The two terminal CH3 groups (6H) are split by the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet.

    # --- Step 2: Check Compound B (2-bromobutane) ---
    # Question constraint: Compound A undergoes monobromination to form B.
    # This free-radical reaction favors substitution at the more stable secondary carbon over the primary one.
    # The major product is therefore 2-bromobutane.

    # --- Step 3: Check Compound C (but-2-ene) ---
    # Question constraint: B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers.
    # This is an E2 elimination. Zaitsev's rule predicts the formation of the more substituted alkene, which is but-2-ene.
    # But-2-ene exists as cis and trans isomers, satisfying the constraint. But-1-ene does not have geometrical isomers.

    if llm_C != "but-2-ene":
        errors.append("Step 3 (Compound C): Incorrect identification. E2 elimination of 2-bromobutane yields but-2-ene, which satisfies the geometrical isomer constraint.")

    # --- Step 4: Check Compound D (Diels-Alder Product) ---
    # This step verifies the stereochemical reasoning.
    # The LLM correctly notes that the reaction as written ((1E,3E)-diene) does not produce any of the options. This is a valid and important observation.
    # The check will proceed based on the LLM's proposed correction.
    # Proposed Diene: (1E,3Z)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. In its s-cis conformation, the outer groups (-OH and -CH3) are CIS.
    # Dienophile: cis-but-2-ene. The two -CH3 groups are CIS.
    # Proposed Pathway: Exo. In an exo cycloaddition, the dienophile substituents are CIS to the diene's outer substituents.
    # Logical Result: All four substituents (-OH, -CH3, -CH3, -CH3) on the final product ring will be cis to each other.
    # The LLM's reasoning to arrive at an all-cis product is sound, given the necessary assumptions (typo and exo pathway).

    # Finally, let's verify the R/S assignment for the all-cis product: all-cis-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol.
    # Assuming all substituents are "up" (wedge) and H is "down" (dash) for assignment:
    # C1 (with -OH): Priorities: -OH(1), -C2=C(2), -C6(3). Path 1->2->3 is counter-clockwise -> (S). Correct.
    # C4 (with -CH3): Priorities: -C3=C(1), -C5(2), -CH3(3). Path 1->2->3 is clockwise -> (R). Correct.
    # C5 (with -CH3): Priorities: -C4(1), -C6(2), -CH3(3). (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules give C4 > C6). Path 1->2->3 is counter-clockwise -> (S). Correct.
    # C6 (with -CH3): Priorities: -C1(O)(1), -C5(2), -CH3(3). Path 1->2->3 is clockwise -> (R). Correct.
