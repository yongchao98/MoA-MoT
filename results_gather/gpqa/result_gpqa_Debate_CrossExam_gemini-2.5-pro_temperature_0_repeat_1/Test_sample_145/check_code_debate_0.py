            "2.  **Facial Selectivity:** The answer correctly states that the electronegative fluorine substituent directs a 'syn' attack, where the dienophile approaches from the same side as the fluorine.\n\n"
            "3.  **Geometric Error:** The crucial mistake is in determining the resulting product geometry. The answer claims that a 'syn' attack places the fluorine atom 'anti' to the C5-C6 double bond of the product. This is factually incorrect. A 'syn' attack on a 5-substituted cyclopentadiene places the substituent in the 'syn' position relative to the double bond in the final norbornene adduct.\n\n"
            "4.  **Incorrect CIP Assignment:** Based on its flawed geometric assumption (F is 'anti'), the answer deduces an '8s' configuration for the C8 carbon. While the CIP assignment for that specific wrong geometry might be correct, the premise is wrong. Applying the CIP rules to the correct geometry (F is 'syn' to the double bond) results in an '8r' configuration.\n\n"
            f"**Conclusion:** The major product is the result of an 'endo, syn' attack, which yields the 'endo, 8r' isomer. This corresponds to option B: (3aR,4S,7R,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione."
