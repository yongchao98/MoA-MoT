def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the chemical puzzle.

    The function verifies the chemical facts and reasoning steps presented in the answer.
    1.  Identifies the proposed chemical species (B, D, H, F, G, E).
    2.  Checks the properties of these species against known chemical data (acid strength, use as solvent, hazard level).
    3.  Checks the key piece of information: the molecular symmetry of the proposed final product E.
    4.  Compares the deduced correct symmetry with the final answer provided by the LLM.
