    "Proposer: The problem describes a classic scenario of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. The key property of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived.\n\nMy proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  First, determine the decay constant, λ, from the initial information: a 32% probability of decay in 100 minutes. The survival probability, P(T > t), is given by e^(-λt). Therefore, the decay probability is 1 - e^(-λt).\n    *   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n    *   e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n2.  Next, we need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability: P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50).\n3.  Due to the memoryless property, this conditional probability is equal to the unconditional probability of the atom decaying in a 150-minute interval starting from time zero: P(T < 150).\n4.  Calculate P(T < 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n5.  From step 1, we have e^(-100λ) = 0.68. We can write e^(-150λ) as (e^(-100λ))^(1.5), which is 0.68^1.5.\n6.  The final probability is 1 - 0.68^1.5. I will use a search query to perform this calculation accurately.\n\nMy proposed action is to use a search engine to calculate the final numerical value.\n\nSkeptic: The reasoning seems solid, especially the application of the memoryless property, which is a fundamental concept in exponential decay processes. However, the entire answer hinges on the correct application of this principle and the subsequent calculation. My main concern is ensuring the calculation is precise, as the multiple-choice options are relatively close to each other. A search that also confirms the formula for conditional probability in radioactive decay would add confidence to the result.\n\nDecide: The proposed path is logical. The next step is to execute the calculation and verify the underlying principle. A combined search can achieve this.\n\nProposer: The search results confirm my initial approach. Result explicitly states the memoryless property of processes like radioactive decay: \"P(T > t + s | T > s) = P(T > t)\". This means the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes it has already survived. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the unconditional probability of decay within 150 minutes. My calculation path remains the same: find the decay constant λ from the first condition and then use it to find the probability for a 150-minute interval. The final calculation is `1 - 0.68^1.5`.\n\nSkeptic: I agree. The search results, particularly and, strongly support the use of the memoryless property for single-atom decay. The problem is now reduced to a straightforward calculation. The key is to perform this calculation accurately to select the correct multiple-choice option.\n\nDecide: The debate has converged. The physical principle is confirmed, and the calculation is clear. The next and final step is to perform the calculation and select the answer.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Define Survival Probability:** The probability that an atom survives past time `t` is `P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n2.  **Use Given Information:** We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. This means the survival probability is 100% - 32% = 68%.\n    *   `P(T > 100) = e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n3.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived for 50 minutes. This is `P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50)`. Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, this is equal to the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, `P(T < 150)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    *   `P(T < 150) = 1 - P(T > 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-150λ)` as `(e^(-100λ))^(150/100)` or `(e^(-100λ))^1.5`.\n    *   From step 2, we know `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    *   Substituting this value gives: `1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Calculating the value: `0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   The final probability is `1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n5.  **Conclusion:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
