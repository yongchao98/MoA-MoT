def check_radioactive_decay_probability():
    """
    This function verifies the solution to the radioactive decay problem.
    It follows these steps:
    1.  Defines the initial conditions from the problem statement.
    2.  Replicates the calculation logic presented in the provided answer.
        - The core principle is the "memoryless" property of exponential decay.
        - The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes already survived.
        - It calculates the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval.
    3.  Calculates the survival probability for 100 minutes: P(T > 100).
    4.  Uses this to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes: P(T < 150) = 1 - P(T > 150).
        - The key mathematical step is P(T > 150) = P(T > 100)^(150/100).
    5.  Compares the calculated result with the numerical value in the explanation (43.93%).
    6.  Checks if this result corresponds to the chosen option 'B' (44%).
    7.  Returns "Correct" if all checks pass, otherwise returns a reason for the discrepancy.
