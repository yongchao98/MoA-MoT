    "**Proposer:** The goal is to compute the expectation value of the operator `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x` for the spin state `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`. The most direct way to solve this is to use the linearity of the expectation value: `⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩`. I will calculate the expectation values of `σ_z` and `σ_x` individually and then combine them.\n\n**Skeptic:** This approach is sound, but prone to calculation errors. Are you certain about the standard definitions and actions of the Pauli matrices on the spin eigenstates? A small mistake in a sign or a factor will lead to the wrong answer. For instance, what are `σ_z|↓⟩` and `σ_x|↑⟩`? Also, ensure the final arithmetic is carefully checked, especially the multiplication involving `√3`.\n\n**Proposer:** I will proceed with the calculation, keeping those checks in mind.\n\n1.  **Calculate `⟨σ_z⟩`**:\n    The operator `σ_z` has `|↑⟩` and `|↓⟩` as its eigenstates with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.\n    `σ_z|ψ⟩ = σ_z(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩) = 0.5(σ_z|↑⟩) + (√3)/2(σ_z|↓⟩) = 0.5(+1)|↑⟩ + (√3)/2(-1)|↓⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩`.\n    The expectation value is `⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩`.\n    `⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * (0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩)`.\n    Using the orthonormality of the basis states (`⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1`, `⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1`, `⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0`), this simplifies to:\n    `⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)(0.5) - (√3/2)(√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`.\n\n2.  **Calculate `⟨σ_x⟩`**:\n    The `σ_x` operator flips the spin states: `σ_x|↑⟩ = |↓⟩` and `σ_x|↓⟩ = |↑⟩`.\n    `σ_x|ψ⟩ = σ_x(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩) = 0.5(σ_x|↑⟩) + (√3)/2(σ_x|↓⟩) = 0.5|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩`.\n    The expectation value is `⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩`.\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * ((√3)/2|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩)`.\n    This simplifies to:\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`.\n\n3.  **Combine the results**:\n    `⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩ = 10(-0.5) + 5(√3/2) = -5 + 2.5√3`.\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation**:\n    Using the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n    `⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732 = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67`.\n\n**Skeptic:** The steps are logically sound and the intermediate calculations for `⟨σ_z⟩` and `⟨σ_x⟩` are correct. The final arithmetic `-5 + 4.33 = -0.67` is also correct. When rounded to one decimal place, this value is -0.7. This matches option A. The debate converges.\n\n<<<A>>>"
