  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s).

    "**Proposer**: The goal is to determine the genetic interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3 based on the provided knockout mutant data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of G2**: The knockout mutant `g2` shows a complete loss of resistance (0%). Furthermore, the double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3` also show 0% resistance, the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. This means that the `g2` mutation masks the phenotype of the `g1` and `g3` mutations. In genetic terms, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. An upstream regulatory gene being knocked out would lead to a severe phenotype that is epistatic to downstream genes. This strongly suggests that G2 is the upstream transcription factor.\n\n2.  **Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3**: The single mutants `g1` and `g3` have 75% and 50% resistance, respectively. The double mutant `g1g3` has only 10% resistance. The effect of the double knockout is much more severe than the effect of either single knockout and also more severe than a simple additive effect (where resistance would be 100% - (100%-75%) - (100%-50%) = 25%). This synergistic interaction suggests that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways that both contribute to resistance. This relationship, where the combined loss of function is greater than the sum of its parts, is a form of gene redundancy.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Epistasis between G1 and G3**: For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would need to match the `g1` phenotype (75%). This is not the case. For G3 to be epistatic to G1, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would need to match the `g3` phenotype (50%). This is also not the case. Therefore, there is no epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options**:\n    *   A) \"G2 is a transcription factor\" (Correct), \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\" (Unsupported), \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" (Incorrect).\n    *   B) \"G2 is a transcription factor\" (Correct), \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\" (Unsupported), \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" (Incorrect).\n    *   C) \"G2 is a transcription factor\" (Correct), \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" (Correct interpretation of the synergistic effect), \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" (Incorrect).\n    *   D) \"G1 is a transcription factor\" (Incorrect), \"G2 and G3 show pleiotropy\" (Unsupported), \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\" (Correct).\n\n**Skeptic**: All options contain at least one incorrect or unsupported statement. Option D contains a statement that is verifiably correct (\"G2 is epistatic towards G1\"), while option C contains a statement that is verifiably false (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\"). However, option D incorrectly identifies G1 as the transcription factor, which is a major contradiction with the data (the `g1` mutant has the mildest phenotype). Option C correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and correctly describes the G1/G3 interaction as redundancy. The error in option C is the final clause about epistasis. It is likely that this clause is a flaw in the question's options, as it is also incorrect in options A and B.\n\n**Decision**: The most critical conclusions from the data are that G2 is the upstream transcription factor and that G1 and G3 have redundant/synergistic functions. Option C is the only one that captures both of these key points. Despite the incorrect final clause, it represents the best overall conclusion from the experiment.\n\n<<<C>>>"
