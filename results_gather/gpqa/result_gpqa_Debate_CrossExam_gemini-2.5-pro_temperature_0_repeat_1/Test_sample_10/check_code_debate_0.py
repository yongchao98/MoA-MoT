    # --- Statement A Analysis ---
    # Claim 1: Rate of frameshifting is LINEARLY correlated with the number of conformations.
    # Fact: The relationship is more complex. Research points to a correlation with "conformational plasticity" or "dynamics," not a simple linear correlation with the number of states. The term "linearly" is a very strong and likely inaccurate simplification.
    # Claim 2: SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 signals show two conformations under tension.
    # Fact: Studies using optical tweezers have shown that the pseudoknot can unfold through multiple pathways and adopt different conformations, but characterizing it as exactly "two" is a simplification that might depend on experimental conditions.
    # Conclusion: The statement contains oversimplifications and a likely factual error regarding the "linear" correlation. It is questionable and potentially incorrect.
    analysis['A'] = (False, "The claim of a 'linear' correlation between frameshifting rate and number of conformations is a significant oversimplification; the actual relationship is related to complex conformational dynamics, not a simple linear function.")

    # --- Statement B Analysis ---
    # Claim 1: Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near the 5' end.
    # Fact: This is correct. The -1 PRF at the ORF1a/1b junction produces polyprotein pp1a and, after the frameshift, the larger pp1ab. This occurs relatively early in the genome (i.e., towards the 5' end).
    # Claim 2: It happens by moving back 1 nucleotide with a slippery sequence and pseudoknot.
    # Fact: This is the correct mechanism for -1 PRF in coronaviruses.
    # Claim 3: SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV PRF have the same conformation.
    # Fact: The frameshifting elements are highly conserved in sequence and structure between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, leading to very similar function and conformation.
    # Conclusion: This statement is factually correct.
    analysis['B'] = (True, "This statement accurately describes the canonical -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) mechanism in coronaviruses.")

    # --- Statement C Analysis ---
    # Claim 1: nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism.
    # Fact: Correct. nsp10 is a cofactor for the nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN), which provides proofreading (a form of mismatch repair).
    # Claim 2: The complex PREVENTS the breakdown of dsRNA.
    # Fact: This is fundamentally incorrect. The function of the nsp14-ExoN is to DEGRADE RNA from the 3' end to remove mismatched nucleotides. It *causes* the breakdown of nascent, incorrectly synthesized RNA, it does not *prevent* it. This is the direct opposite of its function.
    # Conclusion: This statement is definitively incorrect.
    analysis['C'] = (False, "This statement is incorrect because the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex is an exoribonuclease that actively DEGRADES RNA to perform proofreading. It does not 'prevent the breakdown of dsRNA'; it causes it.")

    # --- Statement D Analysis ---
    # Claim 1: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting Bcl-2.
    # Fact: Research has shown that ORF3a induces apoptosis and can activate caspases, including the initiator caspase-8. Some studies report this happens without significant changes in the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.
    # Claim 2: This mechanism suggests apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway.
    # Fact: This is a correct conclusion. Caspase-8 activation is the hallmark of the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway, while Bcl-2 is a key regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway.
    # Conclusion: This statement is a correct summary of findings from multiple studies.
    analysis['D'] = (True, "This statement accurately describes a known pro-apoptotic mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein, linking it to the extrinsic pathway via caspase-8 activation.")
