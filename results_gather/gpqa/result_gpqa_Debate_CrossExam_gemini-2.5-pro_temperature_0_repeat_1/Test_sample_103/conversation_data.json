    "### Self-Debate and Final Answer\n\n**Proposer:** The goal is to determine the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets (T₂/T₁). The provided information includes the periodic wavelength shifts (Δλ) for each star, and the fact that the stars have identical masses and the planets have similar masses.\n\nThe proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  The periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is caused by the Doppler effect and is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity (K). Therefore, the ratio Δλ₁/Δλ₂ is equal to the ratio K₁/K₂.\n2.  The star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is a function of the star's mass (M), the planet's mass (mₚ), and the semi-major axis of the orbit (a).\n3.  By establishing the relationship between K and 'a', we can use the known ratio of K₁/K₂ to find the ratio of a₂/a₁.\n4.  Using Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (T) to the semi-major axis (a) and the stellar mass (M), we can find the desired ratio T₂/T₁.\n\n**Skeptic:** This approach has potential flaws. First, the problem states the planets have \"similar\" masses, not identical ones. How does this ambiguity affect the result? Second, the measured radial velocity depends on the inclination of the orbit (sin *i*), which is unknown for both systems. If the inclinations are different, the ratio K₁/K₂ is not simply determined by the other orbital parameters.\n\n**Resolution:**\nThe multiple-choice format of the question suggests that a definitive answer can be reached. This implies that we should treat the \"similar\" masses as equal for the calculation. Any minor differences would lead to a result that is still approximately one of the given options. The issue of the unknown inclination angles is more significant. However, for the problem to be solvable, we must assume that the inclination angles are the same for both systems (or that the effect of inclination is already accounted for in the given shift values). Without this assumption, no solution is possible. Therefore, the debate converges on the conclusion that these idealizing assumptions are intended.\n\n### Derivation\nThe amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is proportional to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K).\nΔλ ∝ K\n\nFor a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude K is given by:\nK ∝ (mₚ / √(Mₛₜₐᵣ)) * (1 / √a)\nwhere mₚ is the planet's mass, Mₛₜₐᵣ is the star's mass, and 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n\nGiven that mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂ and Mₛₜₐᵣ₁ = Mₛₜₐᵣ₂, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is:\nK₁ / K₂ = √a₂ / √a₁\n\nSince Δλ ∝ K, we have:\nΔλ₁ / Δλ₂ = √a₂ / √a₁\n5 / 7 = √(a₂ / a₁)\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² = 25 / 49\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of the star (Mₛₜₐᵣ).\nT² ∝ a³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ\n\nThe ratio of the periods is therefore:\n(T₂ / T₁)² = (a₂³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ₂) / (a₁³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ₁)\n\nSince Mₛₜₐᵣ₁ = Mₛₜₐᵣ₂, this simplifies to:\n(T₂ / T₁)² = (a₂ / a₁)³\nT₂ / T₁ = (a₂ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\nSubstituting the value for a₂/a₁:\nT₂ / T₁ = ((5 / 7)²)^(3/2)\nT₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\nT₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>"
