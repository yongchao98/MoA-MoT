    "**Proposer:** The goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2). The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula T_eq = T_star * √(R_star / (2a)), where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since T_star, R_star, and the albedo are the same for both planets, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1).\n\nMy proposed path is to first determine the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1) using the provided information about the planets' masses and the radial velocity shifts they induce. The semi-major axis 'a' can be related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) by the formula a = (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star). The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the observed Doppler shift Δλ (K = c * Δλ / λ). By calculating the ratio a2/a1, we can then find the temperature ratio. This approach avoids calculating the absolute values of 'a' or 'T_eq' and simplifies the problem by canceling out most constants. I do not need to perform a search at this time.\n\n**Skeptic:**\n1.  **Implicit Assumption of Inclination:** Your formula for the semi-major axis, a = (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star), assumes an orbital inclination of 90° (sin(i)=1). The problem states the planets were detected by both transit and RV methods, which strongly implies an inclination close to 90°, but it's not explicitly stated to be exactly 90°. If the inclinations (i1 and i2) are different, the formula for the ratio would be a2 / a1 = (M_p2/M_p1)² * (K1/K2)² * (sin(i2)/sin(i1))².\n2.  **Co-planarity:** Are we to assume the planets are co-planar (i.e., i1 = i2)? If they are, the sin(i) terms would cancel out, and your initial approach would be valid. For multi-planetary systems discovered by transit, assuming co-planarity is a common and reasonable simplification unless stated otherwise.\n3.  **Extraneous Information:** You've identified that several pieces of data (star's radius, temperature, planet radii) are likely distractors. Are you certain none of them are needed for a more complete formula? For instance, does the star's temperature affect the Doppler shift measurement? No, the Doppler shift formula K = c * (Δλ / λ) is independent of the star's temperature. The other parameters are only needed for absolute temperature calculations, not the ratio.\n\n**Decision:** The Proposer's path is the most logical. The potential issue raised by the Skeptic regarding orbital inclination is the most critical point. However, given that both planets were detected via the transit method orbiting the same star, it is a standard and necessary assumption for this problem that either the inclinations are both effectively 90° (sin(i)≈1) or that the orbits are co-planar (i1=i2). In either case, the inclination factor cancels out of the ratio. Therefore, the simplified approach is valid. The next step is to execute the calculation based on the Proposer's plan. No external search is required as the problem relies on fundamental physics principles.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Define the relationship for the temperature ratio:**\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)\n\n2.  **Define the relationship for the semi-major axis ratio:**\n    *   a ∝ M_p² / K²\n    *   Therefore, a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio of the planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n4.  **Calculate the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 / K2):**\n    *   K is proportional to the Doppler shift, Δλ.\n    *   K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\n5.  **Substitute these ratios to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1):**\n    *   a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n    *   a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    *   a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n6.  **Finally, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:**\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(225 / 784)\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √225 / √784\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
