    """
    Checks the number of possible products from the self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. The reactant is racemic, so it's a mix of (R) and (S) enantiomers.
    2. The self-metathesis reaction involves two molecules of the reactant coupling.
    3. We determine the number of unique stereochemical pairings of the reactants.
    4. We determine the number of possible geometries for the newly formed double bond.
    5. The total number of products is the product of these two numbers.
