    "The final analysis confirms that the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Here is a breakdown of how the provided spectral data leads to this conclusion:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 establishes the molecular weight of the compound. The key information is the peak at m/z = 158, which is about one-third the intensity of the molecular ion peak. This M+2 isotopic pattern is a definitive indicator of the presence of one chlorine atom. All four possible options have a molecular weight of 156.57 g/mol and contain one chlorine atom, so this data confirms the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows two crucial features. First, a very broad absorption band stretching from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid. Second, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the carbonyl (C=O) group of an aromatic carboxylic acid. This combination of peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which effectively eliminates options C (Phenyl chloroformate) and D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde).\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:** The ¹H NMR data provides the final clues to distinguish between the remaining isomers, 4-chlorobenzoic acid and 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm with an integration of 1H is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), further supporting the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The aromatic region of the spectrum shows two doublets, one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another at 7.72 ppm (2H). This symmetrical pattern of two signals, each representing two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring. 4-chlorobenzoic acid has this para-substitution. 2-chlorobenzoic acid, being unsymmetrical, would produce a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals for its four different aromatic protons.\n\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic methods, the structure is unambiguously identified.\n\n<<<A>>>"
