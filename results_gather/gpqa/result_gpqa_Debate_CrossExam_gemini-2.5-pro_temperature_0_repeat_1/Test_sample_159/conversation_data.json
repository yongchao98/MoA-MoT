    "Proposer: The core of the problem is to determine the shape of the aperture when the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large. An N-sided regular polygon where the apothem 'a' (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) is constant will approach a circle as N approaches infinity. In this limit, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The minima of this pattern are related to the zeros of the first-order Bessel function. I need to find the angular positions of the first two minima and then calculate the difference between them.\n\nSkeptic: Your reasoning that the N-sided polygon becomes a circle of radius 'a' is sound. The relationship between the radius 'r' (center to vertex) and apothem 'a' is `a = r * cos(π/N)`. As N -> ∞, `cos(π/N)` -> `cos(0)` = 1, so `a = r`. However, you need the specific formula for the angular positions of the minima in an Airy pattern. This is not a simple formula and depends on the zeros of a Bessel function. You also need the numerical values for at least the first two of these zeros. The next step must be to find this precise formula and the required numerical values.\n\nProposer: Agreed. I will search for the formula for the minima of Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture and the values of the first two zeros of the relevant Bessel function.\nProposer: The search results confirm the approach. For a circular aperture, the angular positions of the diffraction minima are given by the formula `sin(θ) ≈ θ = (z * λ) / d`, where 'd' is the diameter of the aperture and 'z' are factors derived from the zeros of the Bessel functions. Specifically, for the minima, the formula is `sin(θ) = m_n * λ / d`, where `m_n` are the positions of the minima. Result gives the positions for the first few minima as `sin(θ_min) = 1.22 λ/d`, `2.23 λ/d`, `3.24 λ/d`, etc. In our problem, the aperture shape approaches a circle of radius 'a', so its diameter is `d = 2a`.\n\nSkeptic: The formula you've cited, `sin(θ) = 1.22 λ/d`, is for the *first* minimum. The question asks for the angular distance between the *first two* minima. You need the positions of both the first and the second minimum. Result provides these. The first minimum is at `1.22 λ/d` and the second is at `2.23 λ/d`. You have all the necessary information to perform the final calculation.\n\nProposer: Correct. Let's proceed with the calculation.\nThe angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is given by `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * λ / d`.\nThe angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is given by `θ₂ ≈ 2.23 * λ / d`.\nThe diameter `d` is `2a`.\nSo, `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a`.\nAnd `θ₂ ≈ 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a`.\nThe angular distance between them is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n`Δθ ≈ (1.115 - 0.610) * λ / a = 0.505 * λ / a`.\nThis value is very close to option D, which is `0.506 λ / a`. The slight difference might be due to rounding in the values `1.22` and `2.23`. Let's use more precise values for the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The minima occur when `(πd/λ)sin(θ)` equals a zero of `J₁(x)`. The first non-trivial zero is approximately 3.8317 and the second is 7.0156.\n\nSo, `θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (π * d) = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.610 * λ / a`.\nAnd `θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (π * d) = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1168 * λ / a`.\nThe angular distance is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1168 - 0.610) * λ / a = 0.5068 * λ / a`.\nThis confirms that `0.506 λ / a` is the correct answer.\n\nSkeptic: The logic is sound and the calculation is verified. The initial assumption holds, the formulas are correct, and the result matches one of the options precisely. We have converged.\n\n<<<D>>>"
