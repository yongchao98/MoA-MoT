    "**Proposer**: The goal is to identify which of the four listed symmetries—Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT—must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). My understanding is that SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory. Poincare symmetry is a broader group that includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations, and it is a fundamental symmetry of special relativity. Therefore, SMEFT operators should respect both. The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory is also CPT-invariant. This means CPT should also be a required symmetry. In contrast, CP symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model, and SMEFT is designed to parameterize new physics, including potential new sources of CP violation. Thus, CP symmetry is not required for all operators. My proposed solution is that Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries must be respected. I will perform a search to confirm the foundational symmetries of SMEFT.\n\n**Skeptic**: Your reasoning seems sound, but let's be precise. Is Poincare symmetry explicitly imposed, or is it just Lorentz symmetry? While Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, it's important to confirm which is the fundamental assumption in the construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian. Also, while the CPT theorem is a strong constraint, are there any loopholes or assumptions in its application to SMEFT that we should be aware of? The core of the question is what symmetries are *imposed* by definition in the SMEFT framework. We need to verify that SMEFT is, by construction, a Poincare-invariant and CPT-invariant theory, and that it explicitly allows for CP-violating operators.\n\n**Action**: The next step is to execute the search proposed by the Proposer to verify the fundamental symmetries imposed on the SMEFT Lagrangian.\n\n**Proposer**: The search results confirm my initial assessment. The SMEFT Lagrangian is explicitly constructed to be an infinite series of higher-dimensional local operators built from the Standard Model fields that obey gauge and Poincaré symmetries. Since Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations, both Lorentz symmetry (1) and Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Furthermore, the CPT theorem states that any local, unitary, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must also be CPT invariant. As SMEFT is defined to be a Lorentz-invariant field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry (4). In contrast, the search results show extensive research into classifying and constraining CP-violating operators within SMEFT. This confirms that CP symmetry (3) is *not* a required symmetry for all operators; in fact, SMEFT is a framework used to search for new sources of CP violation. Therefore, the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n**Skeptic**: The evidence is strong. The definition of the SMEFT Lagrangian explicitly requires Poincaré invariance. This covers both points 1 and 2. The CPT theorem's reliance on Lorentz invariance as a precondition is also well-established, making CPT a necessary symmetry for SMEFT. The sheer volume of literature on identifying and constraining CP-violating operators within SMEFT demonstrates that CP is not a mandatory symmetry. The logic is sound and the conclusion is well-supported by the search results.\n\n**Conclusion**: The debate has converged. The evidence clearly indicates that SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetry by construction, and CPT symmetry as a consequence of the CPT theorem. CP symmetry is explicitly allowed to be violated.\n\n<<<B>>>"
