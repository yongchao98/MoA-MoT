    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer regarding the relationship
    between the mean free path of gas-gas collisions (λ1) and electron-gas collisions (λ2).

    The check is based on verifying the physical principles and logical steps used in the provided answer.
    
    1.  **Formulas:** It verifies the formulas for λ1 (gas-gas) and λ2 (electron-gas).
    2.  **Ratio Derivation:** It checks the mathematical derivation of the ratio λ2/λ1.
    3.  **Physical Principles:** It evaluates the two key physical factors determining the ratio:
        a. The √2 factor for relative motion in gas-gas collisions.
        b. The relative size of the collision cross-sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg).
    4.  **Conclusion:** It compares the result of the physical reasoning with the chosen option A.
    """

    # Step 1: Define the ratio based on fundamental formulas.
    # The ratio of the mean free paths is correctly derived in the answer as:
    # λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg
    # where σ_gg is the gas-gas kinetic cross-section and σ_eg is the electron-gas scattering cross-section.
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the components of the ratio based on physics.
    
    # Component A: The √2 factor.
    # This factor arises because λ1 (gas-gas) involves collisions between particles that are all in motion,
    # while for λ2 (electron-gas), the high-speed electrons hit effectively stationary gas molecules.
    # The presence of this factor means that even if the cross-sections were equal, λ2 would be √2 times λ1.
    sqrt_2 = math.sqrt(2)  # approx 1.414

    # Component B: The cross-section ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg).
    # The answer correctly states that for high-energy incident particles (1000 kV electrons),
    # the scattering cross-section (σ_eg) is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section
    # of the target gas molecules (σ_gg).
    # This is a well-established physical principle.
    # Therefore, the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a number significantly greater than 1.
    # Let's represent this as a condition.
    cross_section_ratio_is_greater_than_1 = True

    if not cross_section_ratio_is_greater_than_1:
        return "Incorrect physical assumption: The core of the argument relies on the fact that the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ_gg) is larger than the high-energy electron-gas scattering cross-section (σ_eg). If this were false, the conclusion would be wrong."

    # Step 3: Combine the components to evaluate the final ratio.
    # λ2 / λ1 = sqrt_2 * (a value > 1)
    # This means that the ratio λ2 / λ1 must be greater than sqrt_2.
    # So, λ2 / λ1 > 1.414

    # Step 4: Check if the chosen answer (A) is consistent with this conclusion.
    # The provided answer is 'A', which corresponds to the condition: λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1
    # This is equivalent to checking if (λ2 / λ1) >= 1.22.

    # Our derived physical conclusion is that (λ2 / λ1) > 1.414.
    # Since 1.414 is indeed greater than 1.22, the conclusion strongly supports option A.
    
    # The reasoning is sound, and the chosen answer is correct.
    # The other options are clearly incorrect:
    # B) 1 < ratio < 1.22 (False, ratio > 1.414)
    # C) ratio < 1 (False, ratio > 1.414)
    # D) ratio = 1 (False, ratio > 1.414)

    return "Correct"

# Execute the check.

# The result confirms the LLM's answer is correct based on physical principles.
