    "Here is a self-debate to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Proposer\n\nThe problem requires comparing two mean free paths in the same sample compartment: λ1 for gas molecule-gas molecule collisions and λ2 for electron-gas molecule collisions.\n\nThe fundamental formula for mean free path (λ) is λ = 1/(nσ), where 'n' is the number density of target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n\n1.  **For λ1 (gas-gas):** The gas molecules are all in random thermal motion. Kinetic theory shows that for collisions within a gas of identical particles, a correction factor of √2 is needed to account for the relative motion.\n    *   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    where σ_gg is the kinetic collision cross-section between two gas molecules.\n\n2.  **For λ2 (electron-gas):** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them travel at speeds vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be treated as stationary targets, and the √2 factor is not used.\n    *   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    where σ_eg is the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule.\n\nTo compare λ1 and λ2, we can take their ratio:\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)] = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n\nThe relationship now depends on the relative sizes of the two cross-sections. A simple hard-sphere model would suggest the cross-section for a point-like electron hitting a molecule is smaller than for two molecules hitting each other. More importantly, for very high-energy incident particles like 1000 kV electrons, the scattering cross-section is known to be very small. I will search to compare the typical kinetic cross-section of a gas molecule with the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron.\n\n### Skeptic\n\nThe Proposer's logic is sound, but it hinges entirely on the assertion that the electron-gas scattering cross-section (σ_eg) is significantly smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ_gg). The search results confirm this.\n\n1.  **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ_gg):** The kinetic diameter of a nitrogen molecule (a likely component of residual gas) is consistently reported as 3.64 Å (0.364 nm). The corresponding kinetic cross-section (πd²) is approximately 41.6 Å².\n\n2.  **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (σ_eg):** The search results show that the total scattering cross-section for electrons on N₂ decreases as electron energy increases. A comprehensive review provides recommended values, showing that at 1000 eV (1 keV), the cross-section is 5.77 x 10⁻¹⁶ cm² (or 5.77 Å²). The electron energy in the microscope is 1000 *kilo*-electron-volts (1 MeV), which is a thousand times higher. At such high energies, the scattering cross-section becomes even smaller.\n\n3.  **Comparison:**\n    *   σ_gg ≈ 41.6 Å²\n    *   σ_eg (at 1 keV) ≈ 5.8 Å²\n    *   Clearly, σ_gg is much larger than σ_eg.\n\nThe Proposer's conclusion is therefore well-supported. The ratio λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg involves a numerator that is significantly larger than the denominator, making the ratio a number much greater than 1. The debate can converge.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe relationship between the two mean free paths, λ1 (gas-gas) and λ2 (electron-gas), is determined by two key factors:\n\n1.  **Relative Motion:** The formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other moving gas molecules (λ1) includes a √2 factor in the denominator to account for the motion of all particles. The formula for a high-speed electron hitting relatively stationary gas molecules (λ2) does not have this factor. This alone would make λ2 larger than λ1 by a factor of √2 if the collision cross-sections were equal.\n\n2.  **Collision Cross-Section:** The kinetic collision cross-section for two nitrogen molecules (σ_gg) is based on its kinetic diameter of about 3.64 Å, resulting in a cross-section of roughly 41.6 Å². The scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron (σ_eg) is much smaller. Data shows that even at 1 keV, the cross-section is only about 5.8 Å², and it decreases further at the 1000 keV energy level used in the microscope. Therefore, the cross-section for a gas-gas collision is significantly larger than for a high-energy electron-gas collision (σ_gg >> σ_eg).\n\nCombining these two effects in the ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n\nSince σ_gg is much larger than σ_eg, the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a number significantly greater than 1. Multiplying by √2 (approximately 1.414) results in a value for λ2 / λ1 that is substantially larger than 1.414.\n\nThis means the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) is considerably longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\nLooking at the options:\nA) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1\nB) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1\nC) λ2 < λ1\nD) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation\n\nOur analysis robustly concludes that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Option A is the only choice that reflects this reality.\n\n<<<A>>>"
