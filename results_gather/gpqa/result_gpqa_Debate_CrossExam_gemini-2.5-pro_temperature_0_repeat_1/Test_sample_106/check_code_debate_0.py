        'A': "Incorrect. ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) analysis is a critical but downstream step in drug discovery. It is typically performed after a lead compound with good binding affinity (the goal of docking) has been identified.",
        'B': "Incorrect. This is a common but flawed shortcut. The bioactive conformation of a ligand (the one that binds to the target) is often not its most stable, lowest-energy form in solution. Ignoring other stereoisomers and tautomers risks completely missing the active form.",
        'C': "Correct. This step, known as ligand preparation, is the most crucial prerequisite for a meaningful docking study. Given the molecule's structural complexity (chirality, tautomerism), it is essential to enumerate all plausible forms. Prioritizing them is a rational strategy to make the subsequent, computationally intensive docking step feasible and focused on the most likely candidates.",
        'D': "Incorrect. While combining computational and experimental data is powerful, this step is logistically problematic as a prerequisite. To perform in vitro assays, one needs the physical compounds. For a novel molecule with many potential isomers, synthesizing or isolating all of them *before* any computational screening is generally impractical and cost-prohibitive. In silico docking is often used to guide which specific forms should be synthesized for such assays."
