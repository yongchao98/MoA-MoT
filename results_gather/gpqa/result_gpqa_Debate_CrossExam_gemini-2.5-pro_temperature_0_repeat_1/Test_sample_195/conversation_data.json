    "**Proposer:** My proposed solution is to apply the principle of conservation of relativistic energy. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy, rest energy, and potential energy. This total energy must be constant throughout the motion. I will equate the total energy at the point of maximum displacement (amplitude A) with the total energy at the equilibrium point (x=0).\n\n1.  **At maximum displacement (x = A):**\n    *   The velocity of the mass is momentarily zero (v = 0).\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy, K = (γ - 1)mc², is zero since γ = 1 for v=0.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum, U = (1/2)kA².\n    *   Therefore, the total energy is E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².\n\n2.  **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    *   The potential energy is zero (U = 0).\n    *   The speed is at its maximum, v = v_max.\n    *   The total energy is purely kinetic and rest energy, E_total = γ_max * mc², where γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²).\n\n3.  **By conservation of energy:**\n    *   mc² + (1/2)kA² = γ_max * mc²\n\n4.  **Solving for v_max:**\n    *   Divide by mc²: 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²) = γ_max\n    *   Substitute the expression for γ_max: 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²) = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²)\n    *   Rearrange to solve for the term with v_max: √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))\n    *   Square both sides: 1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n    *   Isolate the v_max term: v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n    *   Take the square root and multiply by c: v_max = c√[1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²]\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n**Skeptic:** The derivation seems correct, assuming the standard conservation of energy principles apply and that the potential energy U = (1/2)kx² is the correct form to use in the relativistic context. The core of the problem lies in how energy is defined. The total relativistic energy of a particle in a potential field is indeed the sum of its rest energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy. The search results confirm that for the standard relativistic harmonic oscillator problem, this energy conservation approach is the correct one to take. The classical potential energy term is added to the relativistic energy expression. The derivation is sound.\n\n**Decision:** The debate converges. The method of equating the total relativistic energy at the two extreme points of the oscillation is correct. The derivation is mathematically sound and leads directly to one of the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
