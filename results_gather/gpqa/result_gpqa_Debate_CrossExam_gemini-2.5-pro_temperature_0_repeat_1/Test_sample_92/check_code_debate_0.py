    # - LLM says deviation is > 0.3 (Option A is true). Our check confirms `is_deviation_high` is True.
    # - LLM says Ct values are inverted (Option B is true). Our check confirms `is_relationship_inverted` is True.
    # - LLM says qPCR is a valid technique (Option C is false). Our check agrees.
    # - LLM says 10-fold dilution is NOT more than 3.3 cycles. Our check confirms `is_dilution_spacing_off` is False, as all differences are exactly 3.3.

    # The question asks for the best explanation for the "discrepancies".
    # An inverted relationship between concentration and Ct (B) is a fundamental, conceptual error that invalidates the entire quantitative aspect of the experiment.
    # High deviation between replicates (A) is an issue of precision/pipetting error, but it doesn't invalidate the core concept in the same way.
    # Therefore, the inverted relationship (B) is the most significant and explanatory discrepancy.
