def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by simulating the biological logic of the experiment.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Identify the core biological principles being tested: iPSC state, lineage-specific promoters, and differentiation timing.
    2.  Determine the expected outcome for the red signal (mRaspberry) based on these principles.
        - iPSCs are undifferentiated.
        - The promoter is lineage-specific, meaning it's only active in differentiated cells.
        - The 48-hour timeframe is too short for iPSCs to differentiate into a specific lineage.
        - Conclusion: No red signal will be produced.
    3.  Evaluate each multiple-choice option against this conclusion.
        - Options that require a red signal (B, C, D) are fundamentally incorrect.
        - Option A is the only one that remains.
    4.  Compare this derived correct answer with the provided LLM answer.
