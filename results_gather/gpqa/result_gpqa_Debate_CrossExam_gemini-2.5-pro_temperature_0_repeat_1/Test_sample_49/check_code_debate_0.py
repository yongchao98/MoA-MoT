    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the Feynman diagram loop question.

    The core principle is that in 4D spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram
    calculation contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2. Therefore, an L-loop diagram
    will have a factor of (1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^(2L).

    The code will:
    1. Parse the expression to find the exponent of the (4pi) term.
    2. Use the formula 2 * L = exponent to solve for L (the number of loops).
    3. Compare the calculated L with the provided answer.
