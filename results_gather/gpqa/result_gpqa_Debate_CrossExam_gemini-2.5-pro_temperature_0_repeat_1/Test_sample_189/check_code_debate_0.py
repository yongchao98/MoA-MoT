An analysis of the nucleophiles based on chemical principles leads to the following ranking:

1.  **Ethanethiolate (5):** In an aqueous (polar protic) solution, nucleophilicity increases down a group in the periodic table. Sulfur is larger and more polarizable than oxygen, and its negative charge is less shielded by solvent molecules (solvation). This makes ethanethiolate a more potent nucleophile than the oxygen-based anions, even though it is a weaker base. Therefore, ethanethiolate is the most reactive nucleophile.

2.  **Hydroxide (2):** This is a strong base with a localized negative charge on a small, electronegative oxygen atom. While it is strongly solvated in water, which reduces its reactivity, it is generally a strong nucleophile. It is less sterically hindered than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate.

3.  **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1):** This is an alkoxide. The alkyl group is electron-donating, which increases the electron density on the oxygen atom, making it a stronger base than hydroxide. While this often translates to increased nucleophilicity, the bulky 4-methylcyclohexyl group introduces significant steric hindrance, which impedes its ability to attack an electrophile. This steric effect makes it less reactive than the smaller hydroxide ion.

4.  **Propionate (3):** This is a carboxylate anion. The negative charge is delocalized across two oxygen atoms through resonance. This resonance stabilization makes the propionate ion a much weaker base and a significantly poorer nucleophile compared to hydroxide and alkoxides, where the charge is localized on a single oxygen atom.

5.  **Methanol (4):** This is a neutral molecule. Anionic nucleophiles are far more reactive than their neutral counterparts. Therefore, methanol is the weakest nucleophile in this series.

Based on this analysis, the correct order from most reactive to least reactive is: Ethanethiolate (5), Hydroxide (2), 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), Propionate (3), and Methanol (4).

This corresponds to option C.
