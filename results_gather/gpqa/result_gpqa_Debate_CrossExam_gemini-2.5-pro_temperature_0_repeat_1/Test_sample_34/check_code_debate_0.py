    # --- Setup based on the problem statement ---

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    # The code has verified that:
    # - Statements A and B are incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real.
    # - Statement D is incorrect because the operator Ay is not diagonal.
    # - Statement C is correct because A^2 and Ay commute, while Ay and Az do not.
    # Since C is the only correct statement, the provided answer is correct.
