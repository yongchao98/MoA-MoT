    "**Proposer's Argument:**\nThe first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one. This involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion to the carbonyl carbon, followed by protonation of the resulting alkoxide ion. The reagents are NaCN and an acid. H3O+ is a suitable acid for this protonation step. The second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile (the cyanohydrin) to a carboxylic acid. This hydrolysis can be achieved by heating with a dilute acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). Therefore, A = H3O+ and B = HCl.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination:**\nFor the first reaction, adding a strong acid like H3O+ directly to NaCN is hazardous as it liberates toxic HCN gas. The reaction is often carried out by generating HCN *in situ* from NaCN and a weaker acid, or by adjusting the pH to around 4-5. However, an acidic workup (represented by H3O+) is a common final step to ensure protonation. For the second reaction, nitrile hydrolysis is indeed catalyzed by strong acids like HCl. While weak acids could work, strong acids are generally more effective. The combination of H3O+ for the first reaction (representing the necessary acidic conditions/workup) and HCl for the second (a standard strong acid for hydrolysis) remains the most chemically sound choice among the given options. The alternative, NaHSO3, is used for a different preparative route.\n\n**Converged Decision:**\nThe debate confirms that the most appropriate set of reagents among the choices are an acid for the cyanohydrin formation and a strong acid for the nitrile hydrolysis.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation. The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of the CN- ion on the ketone. An acid (represented by H3O+) is then required to protonate the intermediate alkoxide to form the final hydroxyl group. While the reaction conditions need careful pH control in practice, H3O+ correctly represents the required acid source for the protonation step.\n*   **Reaction 2:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. This transformation is typically carried out by heating with a strong mineral acid like dilute HCl or H2SO4. Therefore, B = HCl is the most suitable reagent.\n\nBased on this analysis, reagent A is H3O+ and reagent B is HCl.\n\n<<<A>>>"
