    "Here is a self-debate to solve the problem.\n\n**Role: Proposer**\nThe problem asks for the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (R_pl/R_star) that would produce the same light curve amplitude as a star with a spotted hemisphere.\n\nMy proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the amplitude of the light curve variation caused by the rotating spotted star. The variation is between the maximum flux (when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer) and the minimum flux (when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer). The flux (F) is related to temperature (T) by the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴). The amplitude is given by (F_max - F_min) / F_max.\n2.  The amplitude caused by a transiting exoplanet is given by the ratio of the areas of the planet's disk to the star's disk, which simplifies to (R_pl / R_star)².\n3.  By equating these two amplitudes, I can solve for the required radius ratio, R_pl / R_star.\n\nThe action is to perform the calculation based on this model. I will need to find the formula for the amplitude caused by the spots and then solve for the planet radius.\n\n**Role: Skeptic**\nI will cross-examine the proposed solution.\n*   **Model Simplification:** The Proposer's plan relies on a simplified model that ignores effects like limb darkening. Is this simplification justified? For a multiple-choice question with distinct answers, it is highly likely that a simplified, uniform-disk model is expected.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Filling Factor\":** The problem states \"One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%\". The Proposer assumes this means that when this hemisphere faces the observer, 20% of the visible disk is covered by spots. This is a reasonable interpretation, as a uniform distribution of spots over the hemisphere's surface would, on average, result in the same fractional coverage on the projected disk.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Amplitude\":** The Proposer uses the standard definition of photometric amplitude, (F_max - F_min) / F_max. This is the correct quantity to compare with a transit depth, which is also a relative flux measurement.\n*   **Interpretation of the Planet Scenario:** The phrase \"if the star was not covered by spots!\" correctly implies that the baseline for the exoplanet transit is a normal, unspotted star, for which the transit depth formula (R_pl / R_star)² is valid.\n\nThe proposed path seems logically sound and uses standard astrophysical formulas and assumptions appropriate for this level of problem. The key is to correctly calculate the amplitude from the spotted star.\n\n**Decision**\nThe debate converges. The Proposer's plan is sound and addresses the Skeptic's concerns. The next and final action is to execute the calculation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Amplitude from the spotted star:**\n    *   Let F_max be the flux when the unspotted hemisphere (temperature T_star) is visible. We can normalize the flux from this hemisphere to be 1.\n    *   Let F_min be the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible. A fraction `f_spot` = 0.2 of its area has temperature T_spot, and the remaining fraction (1 - f_spot) has temperature T_star.\n    *   Using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law (Flux ∝ T⁴), the relative flux of the spotted hemisphere compared to the unspotted one is:\n        F_min / F_max = (1 - f_spot) * (T_star/T_star)⁴ + f_spot * (T_spot/T_star)⁴\n        F_min / F_max = 1 - f_spot + f_spot * (T_spot/T_star)⁴\n    *   The amplitude (A) of the signal is:\n        A = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n        A = 1 - [1 - f_spot + f_spot * (T_spot/T_star)⁴]\n        A = f_spot * [1 - (T_spot/T_star)⁴]\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        *   f_spot = 0.20\n        *   T_star = 6000 K\n        *   T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n        *   T_spot / T_star = 5000 / 6000 = 5/6\n        A = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n        A = 0.20 * [1 - 625/1296]\n        A = 0.20 * [671 / 1296]\n        A ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775\n        A ≈ 0.10355\n\n2.  **Amplitude from the exoplanet:**\n    *   The amplitude (transit depth) for an exoplanet is:\n        A = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n3.  **Equating the amplitudes:**\n    *   (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n    *   R_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n    *   R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<A>>>"
