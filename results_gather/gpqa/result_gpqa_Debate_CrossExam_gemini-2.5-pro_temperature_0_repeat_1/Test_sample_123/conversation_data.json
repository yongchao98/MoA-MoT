    "Proposer: The problem requires us to find the necessary Lorentz factor (γ) for a specific fraction of particles to survive and reach a detector wall. This can be solved by using the relativistic particle decay formula.\n\nMy proposed solution is as follows:\n1.  Define the survival fraction of particles using the exponential decay law, incorporating time dilation. The number of particles N at a time t in the lab frame is given by N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γ * τ)), where N₀ is the initial number, τ is the proper lifetime, and γ is the Lorentz factor.\n2.  The time `t` for a particle to travel the detector radius `R` is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, we can approximate their velocity `v` as the speed of light `c`, so `t ≈ R/c`.\n3.  Set up two equations based on the two scenarios given:\n    *   Scenario 1: γ₁ = 20, and the survival fraction N/N₀ = 1/3. This gives: 1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ)).\n    *   Scenario 2: γ₂ is unknown, and the survival fraction N/N₀ = 2/3. This gives: 2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)).\n4.  Solve these two equations to find γ₂. By taking the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation and then taking their ratio, the unknown terms `R/c` and `τ` will cancel out, allowing for a direct calculation of γ₂.\n\nMy proposed action is to perform a search to get the precise values of the natural logarithms needed for the calculation.\n\nSkeptic: The proposed path is logical. The use of the relativistic decay formula is appropriate, and the method of solving the two simultaneous equations by taking their ratio is efficient as it eliminates the unknown proper lifetime (τ) and the `R/c` term. The search results provide the necessary high-precision values for the natural logarithms.\n\nLet's verify the calculation with the retrieved values.\n*   From the search results, ln(3) ≈ 1.09861228867.\n*   From the search results, ln(2) ≈ 0.693147.\n*   We need to calculate ln(3/2), which is ln(3) - ln(2).\n    *   ln(3/2) ≈ 1.09861228867 - 0.69314718056 = 0.40546510811\n*   The formula for the new Lorentz factor is γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2)).\n    *   γ₂ = 20 * (1.09861228867 / 0.40546510811)\n    *   γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.70951129\n    *   γ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThe calculation is correct. The result, approximately 54.2, is extremely close to the answer choice D) 54. The minor difference can be attributed to the initial condition stating the Lorentz factor is \"~20\".\n\nThe debate converges. The method is sound, the necessary data has been acquired, and the calculation is verified.\n\n<<<D>>>"
