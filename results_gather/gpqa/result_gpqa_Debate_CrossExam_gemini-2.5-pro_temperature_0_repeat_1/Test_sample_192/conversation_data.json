    "**Proposer**: My initial analysis suggested two possibilities, leading to either r^4 or r^3, depending on the interpretation of the given information. The key is to correctly interpret \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". My preferred interpretation now, after considering the physical meaning, is that this refers to the number of stars per unit of parallax.\n\n**Skeptic**: I agree that interpreting the given relation as the number of stars per unit parallax interval is the most physically sound approach. Let's formalize this. Let *n(plx)* be the number of stars per unit parallax interval. The problem states *n(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5*. We want to find *n(r)*, the number of stars per unit distance interval.\n\nThe number of stars in a small parallax interval *d(plx)* is *n(plx) d(plx)*. This must be equal to the number of stars in the corresponding distance interval *dr*, which is *n(r) dr*. Therefore, *n(r) dr = n(plx) d(plx)*, which means *n(r) = n(plx) |d(plx)/dr|*.\n\nWe know that distance *r* is inversely proportional to parallax *plx*. Using the standard definition where distance is measured in parsecs and parallax in arcseconds, we have the simple formula *r = 1/plx*. From this, we can find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance: *plx = 1/r*, so *d(plx)/dr = -1/r^2*. The absolute value is *|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2*.\n\nNow we can substitute this and the given relation for *n(plx)* into our equation for *n(r)*:\n*n(r) ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)*\n\nFinally, we substitute *plx = 1/r* into this expression:\n*n(r) ∝ (1/(1/r)^5) * (1/r^2)*\n*n(r) ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)*\n*n(r) ∝ r^3*\n\n**Proposer**: The logic is sound and the steps are clear. The relationship between the number of stars per unit distance and the distance itself is a proportionality to r^3. This corresponds to option D.\n\n**Skeptic**: I have no further objections. The conclusion is well-supported by the derivation based on a reasonable interpretation of the problem statement and the fundamental principles of parallax.\n\n<<<D>>>"
