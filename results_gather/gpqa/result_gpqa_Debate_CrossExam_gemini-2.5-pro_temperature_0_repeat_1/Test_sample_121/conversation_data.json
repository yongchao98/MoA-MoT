    "Proposer's path seems the most logical. The reaction sequence is standard for forming a substituted cyclohexane ring. The ambiguity lies in counting the 1H NMR signals, which depends on assumptions about conformational mobility (ring flipping) and the definition of a \"signal\" (whether to count diastereotopic protons separately).\n\nLet's break down the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Reaction Analysis:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Acetic acid + Br2/Pyridine/Acetic Anhydride → Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH). This is an α-bromination reaction.\n    *   **Step 2:** Bromoacetic acid + Ethanol/H₂SO₄ → Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃). This is a standard Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Step 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate + NaCN → Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃). This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) where cyanide displaces bromide.\n    *   **Step 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Final Product (4).\n        *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, forming an enolate.\n        *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the α-carbon of this new intermediate is also deprotonated.\n        *   This second enolate then undergoes an *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to displace the second bromide and form a stable six-membered ring.\n        *   The final product (4) is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n2.  **Structure and Symmetry of Product 4:**\n    *   The product has a cyclohexane ring. Attached to one carbon (C1) are a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This means the NMR spectrum will reflect a time-averaged structure.\n    *   This time-averaged structure possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their associated hydrogens chemically equivalent:\n        *   The protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C6.\n        *   The protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C5.\n        *   C4 and its protons are unique.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Signal Counting:**\n    Based on this symmetry, we can identify the distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n    *   **Signal 1:** The three protons of the ethyl group's methyl (-CH₃).\n    *   **Signal 2:** The two protons of the ethyl group's methylene (-OCH₂-).\n    *   **Signal 3:** The four protons on the C2 and C6 positions of the ring. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent as a set.\n    *   **Signal 4:** The four protons on the C3 and C5 positions of the ring. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent as a set.\n    *   **Signal 5:** The two protons on the C4 position of the ring.\n\nThis analysis leads to a total of **5 distinct hydrogen signals**. While the protons within each CH₂ group on the ring are technically diastereotopic and could have different chemical shifts, in the context of this type of problem, it is common to count each symmetrically distinct group of protons as one signal. This interpretation aligns with one of the given options. The more rigorous count of 7 signals (counting diastereotopic protons separately) is not an option, nor are the counts for alternative products or conformations.\n\nTherefore, the number of observable distinct hydrogen signals is 5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
