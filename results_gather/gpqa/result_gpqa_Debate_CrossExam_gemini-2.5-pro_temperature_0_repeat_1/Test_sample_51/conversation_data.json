    "**Proposer:** The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of two energy level populations of neutral Titanium changes with temperature. This can be solved using the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of energy levels to temperature for a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The core idea is to calculate the population ratio for the star without spots (Teff = 6000 K) and with spots (Teff = 5500 K), and then find the factor by which they differ.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is:\n`N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N₂` and `N₁` are the number of atoms in the upper and lower energy levels, respectively.\n*   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature.\n\nThe energy difference `ΔE` can be found from the transition wavelength `λ` using the formula `ΔE = h * c / λ`.\n\nThe factor we need to find is `Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`.\n\n`Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n\nThe statistical weights `(g₂/g₁)` cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\n`Factor = exp[ (-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]`\n\nMy proposed action is to calculate this factor using the given values. I do not need to perform a search as the problem is self-contained and relies on physical constants.\n\n**Skeptic:**\n1.  **Are you certain about the temperatures?** The problem gives an *overall* effective temperature of 5500 K when the star is 40% covered by spots. The star's surface actually has two temperatures: the unspotted part (presumably still at 6000 K) and the cooler spots. Is using the single effective temperature of 5500 K a valid simplification?\n2.  **Is other physics involved?** The problem mentions neutral Titanium (Ti). The fraction of atoms that are neutral changes with temperature, governed by the Saha equation. Should we account for changes in ionization between 6000 K and 5500 K?\n3.  **Is the extra information relevant?** The star's radius (1.5 solar radii), mass (1.1 solar masses), and the 40% spot coverage are mentioned. Are we sure this information is irrelevant?\n\n**Proposer:**\n1.  For a problem of this type, using the given effective temperatures is the standard and intended approach. The overall effective temperature is the single temperature a black body of the same radius would need to emit the same total luminosity. It's a valid proxy for the characteristic temperature of the photosphere for this calculation.\n2.  The question specifically asks for the ratio of populations (`N₂/N₁`) *within the neutral state*. The Boltzmann equation describes this distribution. The Saha equation describes the ratio of ionized to neutral atoms. Since we are only concerned with the ratio of levels *of the neutral atoms*, the Saha equation is not needed.\n3.  The radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage are context, but the direct physical inputs needed for the Boltzmann equation are the temperatures and the energy levels (derived from the wavelength). Since the resulting effective temperatures are given, we do not need the other data to derive them. They are extraneous details.\n\n**Decision:** The debate converges on the initial plan. The approach is sound, and the potential complexities are either not relevant to the specific question asked or are handled by standard simplifications appropriate for this context. The next and final action is to perform the calculation and select the correct answer.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1.  **Constants:**\n    *   Planck's constant, `h` ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Speed of light, `c` ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Boltzmann constant, `k` ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n2.  **Given Values:**\n    *   Wavelength, `λ` = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   Temperature without spots, `T_nospots` = 6000 K\n    *   Temperature with spots, `T_spots` = 5500 K\n\n3.  **Calculate the energy term `ΔE/k`:**\n    *   `ΔE = h * c / λ = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ * 3.00 x 10⁸) / (1448 x 10⁻¹⁰) ≈ 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J`\n    *   `ΔE / k = 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J / 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K ≈ 99421 K`\n\n4.  **Calculate the temperature term:**\n    *   `1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots = 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) = -500 / 33,000,000 ≈ -1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹`\n\n5.  **Calculate the final factor:**\n    *   `Factor = exp[ (-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]`\n    *   `Factor = exp[ -99421 * (-1.515 x 10⁻⁵) ]`\n    *   `Factor = exp(1.506)`\n    *   `Factor ≈ 4.508`\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
