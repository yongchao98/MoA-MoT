    "**Proposer**: The problem describes an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution. The simplest model for such a system is an oscillating electric dipole. For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) is proportional to sin²(θ), where θ is the angle with the z-axis. The total radiated power is known to be proportional to the fourth power of the oscillation frequency (ω⁴), which is equivalent to being proportional to the inverse fourth power of the wavelength (λ⁻⁴).\n\nLet's test this model.\n1.  **Angular dependence**: The radiated power per unit solid angle is f(θ, λ) = K * sin²(θ) / λ⁴, where K is a constant. The maximum power, A, is radiated at θ = 90° (the equator), because sin²(90°) = 1. Thus, A = K / λ⁴. We need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30°.\n    At θ = 30°, the power is f(30°, λ) = K * sin²(30°) / λ⁴. Since sin(30°) = 1/2, sin²(30°) = 1/4.\n    So, the power at 30° is (K/λ⁴) * (1/4) = A * (1/4). The fraction is 1/4.\n\n2.  **Wavelength dependence**: As stated, the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to ω⁴, and since ω = 2πc/λ, the power is proportional to λ⁻⁴. This means a possible form of the function f includes λ⁻⁴.\n\nCombining these two findings, the fraction is 1/4 and a possible form of f is proportional to λ⁻⁴. This matches option C. I will perform a search to confirm the radiation pattern for an oscillating spheroid and the wavelength dependence.\n\n**Skeptic**: Your reasoning relies on the assumption that an oscillating spheroid acts as a perfect electric dipole. A spheroid is an extended object, not a point dipole. This could introduce higher-order multipole radiation (like quadrupole radiation), which would alter both the angular distribution (it would no longer be a simple sin²(θ)) and potentially the wavelength dependence. For instance, electric quadrupole radiation power is proportional to ω⁶ (or λ⁻⁶). We must verify that the electric dipole approximation is valid and dominant for this shape.\n\n**Action**: The Proposer's path seems solid, but the Skeptic's point is valid and requires confirmation. The next step is to verify the dominant radiation mechanism for an oscillating spheroid and confirm the angular and wavelength dependencies.The debate has converged, and the evidence strongly supports the initial hypothesis.\n\n*   **Radiation Model**: An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution, particularly if its size is small compared to the wavelength λ, is best modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. While higher-order multipoles can exist, the electric dipole radiation is the dominant term.\n\n*   **Angular Distribution of Power**: For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the power radiated per unit solid angle, f(θ, λ), is proportional to sin²(θ).\n    *   The maximum power, A, is radiated at θ = 90°, where sin²(90°) = 1.\n    *   At an angle of θ = 30°, the power is proportional to sin²(30°).\n    *   Since sin(30°) = 1/2, sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4.\n    *   Therefore, the power radiated at 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power A.\n\n*   **Wavelength Dependence**: The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of its oscillation frequency (ω⁴). Since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength (ω = 2πc/λ), the radiated power is proportional to λ⁻⁴.\n\nBased on this analysis, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at 30° is 1/4, and a possible form for the function f describing the power dependence includes a λ⁻⁴ term.\n\n<<<C>>>"
