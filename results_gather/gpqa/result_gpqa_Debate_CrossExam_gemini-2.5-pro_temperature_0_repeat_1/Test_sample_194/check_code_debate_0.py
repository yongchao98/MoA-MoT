def check_exoplanet_period():
    """
    This function verifies the calculation for the maximum orbital period of a second planet
    based on the provided problem description and solution.

    The logic follows these steps:
    1.  Define the known parameters for Planet 1 (P1, b1).
    2.  Establish the condition for the maximum period of Planet 2. This corresponds to the
        maximum possible impact parameter for a transit, which is b2 = 1 (center of the
        planet grazes the stellar limb).
    3.  Use the impact parameter formula, b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s, to find the ratio of the
        semi-major axes (a2/a1). Since the inclination (i) and stellar radius (R_s) are
        the same for both planets, the ratio a2/a1 simplifies to b2/b1.
    4.  Apply Kepler's Third Law (P^2 ∝ a^3) to relate the ratio of semi-major axes to
        the ratio of orbital periods: (P2/P1)^2 = (a2/a1)^3.
    5.  Calculate the maximum period for Planet 2 (P2).
    6.  Compare the calculated result with the provided answer choice.
