    "**Proposer**: My goal is to determine the number of optically active compounds from the provided list. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. I will assess each compound for the presence of chiral centers and the absence of internal symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) that would render it achiral (meso).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is planar around the C=C double bond. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and thus not optically active.\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself provides the specific stereochemical configuration (3aR, 7aS). This indicates that the molecule is a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound. Therefore, it is optically active.\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule possesses two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration creates a plane of symmetry within the molecule, situated between the two chiral carbons. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and not optically active.\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and this specific form is one of two enantiomers ((2R,3R) and (2S,3S)). Therefore, it is optically active.\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The designation (R) specifies the absolute configuration at the C1 carbon, which is a chiral center. This name refers to a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, which is optically active.\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has three stereocenters. However, the all-cis configuration (indicated by 1s,3s,5s) results in a highly symmetric molecule. It possesses three planes of symmetry, each passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom. Due to these symmetry planes, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: A thorough examination of this molecule's structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butyl chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. The molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\nIn summary, three of the compounds are optically active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, and (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n\n**Skeptic**: The analysis seems correct, but the conclusions for meso compounds and other symmetric molecules are critical and can be tricky. I want to double-check the reasoning for the molecules determined to be achiral.\n\n*   For **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**, a Fischer projection confirms the plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, making it a classic meso compound. This is correct.\n*   For **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**, the all-cis arrangement indeed creates planes of symmetry, making it achiral. This is correct.\n*   For **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**, the planarity of the double bond region creates a plane of symmetry for the whole molecule. This is correct.\n*   For **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**, the absence of any carbon atom bonded to four different groups is correctly identified. The molecule is achiral. This is correct.\n\nThe molecules explicitly named as a single enantiomer ((R), or a specific combination like (3aR,7aS)) are by definition chiral and optically active. The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Decision**: The debate converges. The initial analysis is correct. There are three optically active compounds in the list. I will now output the final answer.\n\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is a non-superimposable mirror image of itself. This typically occurs in molecules that lack an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The analysis of each compound is as follows:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is achiral. The atoms connected by the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane, which acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This compound is optically active. The stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS) in its name indicate that it is a specific, single enantiomer of a chiral molecule.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound is achiral. Although it has two chiral centers, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are not optically active.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound is optically active. Unlike its meso diastereomer, the (2R, 3R) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This compound is optically active. The (R) designation indicates a specific enantiomer at a chiral center (the carbon bearing the -OH group), confirming its chirality.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is achiral. The all-cis configuration (1s,3s,5s) gives the molecule planes of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image and thus not optically active.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This compound is achiral. It does not contain any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Therefore, it is not optically active.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
