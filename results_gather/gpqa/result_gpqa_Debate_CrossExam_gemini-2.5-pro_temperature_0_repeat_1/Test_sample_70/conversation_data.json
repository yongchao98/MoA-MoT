    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Radius**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away as a black body. The formula shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance (orbital radius, r) from its star, assuming the planet's albedo and the star's luminosity are constant.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √r\n\n**2. Understand the relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Radius**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis. For the circular orbits specified in the problem, the semi-major axis is the same as the orbital radius (r).\n\nThis can be expressed as:\nP² ∝ r³\n\nFrom this, we can express the orbital radius in terms of the orbital period:\nr ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n**3. Combine the relationships to find the link between Temperature and Period**\n\nNow, we substitute the relationship for the radius (from step 2) into the relationship for the temperature (from step 1):\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2). Using the proportionality from step 3:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nTherefore, we can set P2 = 2 and P4 = 3.5.\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
