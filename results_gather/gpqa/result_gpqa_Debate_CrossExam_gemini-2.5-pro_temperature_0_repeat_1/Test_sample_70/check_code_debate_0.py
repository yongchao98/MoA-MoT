    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer regarding the ratio of equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets.

    The core physics principles are:
    1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius (r), assuming constant albedo and stellar luminosity.
       T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(r)  or  T_eq ∝ r^(-1/2)
    2. Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius (r).
       P^2 ∝ r^3  or  r ∝ P^(2/3)
    3. Combining these two relationships, we can find the relationship between temperature and period:
       T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3)
    4. Therefore, the ratio of temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is given by:
       (P4)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)
