    "**Proposer:** The problem asks for the speed of light in a moving glass medium as observed from a stationary laboratory frame. This requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. The speed of light within the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass, is `u' = c/n`. Since the problem sets `c=1`, this becomes `u' = 1/n`. The glass itself is moving with a velocity `v` in the same direction as the light beam, relative to the laboratory observer.\n\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula for velocities in the same direction is:\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v/c^2)`\n\nSubstituting `c=1` and `u' = 1/n`:\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v)`\n\nTo simplify this expression, I'll find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator:\n`u = ((1 + n*v)/n) / ((n + v)/n)`\n\nThe `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out, leaving:\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option D. To ensure this is the correct application of the formula, I will perform a search.\n\n**Skeptic:** The derivation seems correct based on the standard formula for relativistic velocity addition. However, I must be cautious. Does the index of refraction `n` introduce any complications not accounted for in the simple velocity addition formula? The historical Fizeau experiment dealt with this very question, leading to the concept of \"ether drag\" before Einstein's theory of relativity provided the complete explanation. The search should confirm that for a non-dispersive medium (as is implied by a single value of `n`), the standard relativistic velocity addition is indeed the correct modern approach. The signs in the formula are crucial; since the glass and the light are moving in the same direction toward the observer, we should be adding the velocities in the numerator, which has been done.\n\n**Decision:** The proposed solution path seems robust, but a confirmation of the specific formula for the speed of light in a moving medium is warranted to be certain. I will proceed with a search to verify this.\n\nThe search results confirm that the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Several sources, including, explicitly state the formula and its application to scenarios like the Fizeau experiment, which is analogous to the problem at hand.\n\nThe speed of light in the glass (the moving frame S') is `u' = c/n`. The problem specifies `c=1`, so `u' = 1/n`.\nThe velocity of the glass (the moving frame S') relative to the observer (the stationary frame S) is `v`.\nThe problem states that the glass and the light beam are moving in the same direction.\n\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula is given as `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v/c^2)`.\n\nWith `c=1`, the formula becomes `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v)`.\n\nSubstituting `u' = 1/n`:\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v)`\n\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by `n`:\n`u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis matches the initial derivation and corresponds to option D. The search results reinforce the correctness of this approach, noting that this effect was experimentally confirmed by Fizeau and later explained by Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
