    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required value.\n\n1.  **Identifying Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is given as very close to 277 K. In Celsius, this is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is the well-known melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O).\n\n2.  **Identifying Gas W**: The gas W, released during the reaction, has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's consider some simple gaseous molecules:\n    *   Hydrogen (H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n    *   Deuterium (D₂): 2 protons (1 per D atom), 2 neutrons (1 per D atom). This is a perfect match.\n    *   Nitrogen (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons.\n    *   Carbon Monoxide (¹²C¹⁶O): 14 protons, 14 neutrons.\n    Given that heavy water is involved, D₂ is the most logical identity for gas W.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Reaction**: A violent reaction involving a deuterated substance (as implied by the presence of D₂O and D₂) that produces D₂ gas suggests the reaction of a strong deuterated reducing agent with heavy water. A very common class of reagents in organic chemistry are metal hydrides. The problem states an analog of substance X is a common reagent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful and widely used reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n4.  **Confirming Substance X and the Reaction**: Let's assume Substance X is LiAlD₄ and liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction produces deuterium gas (W = D₂), which matches our deduction.\n    *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃). Lithium deuteroxide is soluble.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases heavy water (B = D₂O), which also matches our initial finding.\n    *   The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is known to be violent, so the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would be as well.\n\n5.  **Verifying with the Keto Acid Clue**: The final clue states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both of these groups to alcohols.\n    *   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH)\n    *   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄, summing the masses of all atoms for each of those two elements.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are Li (3), Al (13), and H (1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The molecule contains four atoms of the hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The approximate atomic mass of Deuterium is 2 amu.\n    *   The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, with an approximate atomic mass of 27 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum)**: 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative sum**: 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
