    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n1.  **Elimination Step:** The strong base, the amide anion (NH2-), abstracts an acidic proton from a position ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n    *   The deuterium atom at the C2 position.\n    *   The hydrogen atom at the C6 position.\n\n2.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** This leads to two possible benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (Major):** Abstraction of the hydrogen from C6 is kinetically favored over the abstraction of the heavier deuterium isotope from C2 due to the kinetic isotope effect. This pathway leads to the formation of a 2-deuteriobenzyne intermediate, where the triple bond is between C1 and C6.\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor):** Abstraction of the deuterium from C2 leads to a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process.\n\n3.  **Addition-Protonation Step:** The nucleophilic amide anion then attacks the benzyne intermediates, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (2-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        *   Attack at C1: The amino group adds to C1. Subsequent protonation at C6 yields *ortho*-deuterioaniline.\n        *   Attack at C6: The amino group adds to C6. Subsequent protonation at C1 yields *meta*-deuterioaniline.\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (benzyne):**\n        *   Attack at C1 or C2: Since the deuterium was removed to form this intermediate, attack by the amide anion at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, results in the formation of non-deuterated aniline.\n\nCounting the unique products from all possible pathways, we have:\n1.  *ortho*-deuterioaniline\n2.  *meta*-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
