    # Step 1: Convert units to SI
    distance_meters = distance_parsecs * parsec_to_meter
    angular_size_radians = math.radians(angular_size_degrees)

    # Step 2: Calculate the Schwarzschild Radius (Rs)
    # The diameter of the event horizon is given by the small-angle formula: D = d * Î¸
    # The Schwarzschild radius is half the diameter: Rs = D / 2
    diameter_meters = distance_meters * angular_size_radians
    schwarzschild_radius = diameter_meters / 2

    # Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Event Horizon (A)
    # The area of a sphere is A = 4 * pi * Rs^2
    area_sq_meters = 4 * math.pi * schwarzschild_radius**2

    # Step 4: Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy (S)
    # The formula is S = (k_B * c^3 * A) / (4 * G * hbar)
    numerator = k_B * (c**3) * area_sq_meters
    denominator = 4 * G * hbar

    # We can do this by checking the base-10 logarithm of the result.

    # the log10 of the entropy should be between 61.5 and 62.5.
