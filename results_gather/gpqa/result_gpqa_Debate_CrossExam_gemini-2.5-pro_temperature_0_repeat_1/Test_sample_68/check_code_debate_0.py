    # 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)
    # Since E and m0 are given in compatible units (GeV and GeV/c^2),
    # the c^2 term cancels out.
    # γ = E_total / E_rest = E / (m0 * c^2)

    # 5. Calculate the minimum resolution (d)
    # The problem asks for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays.
    # This means we need to find the distance 'd' for which the probability of the particle
    # traveling *at least* this distance before decaying is 30%.
    # The survival probability P(x) after a distance x is given by P(x) = exp(-x / λ).
    # We need to solve for d where P(d) = 0.30.
