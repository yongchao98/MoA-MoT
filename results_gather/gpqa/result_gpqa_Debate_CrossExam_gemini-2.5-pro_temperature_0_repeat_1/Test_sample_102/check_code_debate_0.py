        # 1. Step (iii) Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone: The -COCH3 group (at C1) is a meta-director, directing to C5. The -Br group (at C3) is an ortho/para-director, directing to C2, C4, and C6. This conflict of directors leads to a mixture of products and a low yield of any single isomer.
        # 2. Steps (iv) onwards are nonsensical. If the target molecule were formed at step (iii), the subsequent reduction of the nitro group and re-nitration would destroy the desired product.

        # 2. Step (iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation: This reaction fails or gives very low yields on strongly deactivated rings. The product from step (ii), 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group.

        # Key Flaw:
        # Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (formed in step ii). This reaction is known to fail. The basic amino (-NH2) group is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring towards electrophilic substitution.
