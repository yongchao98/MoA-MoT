    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the gene responsible for its synthesis must be inactivated. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that leads to a non-functional protein. Let's analyze the impact of each mutation.\n\nThe original gene sequence begins: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’. This translates to the amino acid sequence: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala...\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’\n    *   The second codon, TTT, is changed to TTC. Both TTT and TTC code for the amino acid Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a silent mutation.\n    *   The third codon, CTC (Leucine), is changed to TAC (Tyrosine). This is a missense mutation, which results in a single amino acid substitution. While this could potentially alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it entirely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’\n    *   The third codon, CTC (Leucine), is changed to TAA. TAA is a \"stop\" or \"nonsense\" codon. This type of mutation, called a nonsense mutation, signals the cell's machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The result is a severely shortened protein (in this case, only two amino acids long), which is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’\n    *   This mutant contains two missense mutations: CTC (Leucine) is changed to TAC (Tyrosine), and further down, ACT (Threonine) is changed to GTC (Valine). While multiple amino acid changes increase the likelihood of disrupting protein function compared to a single change, it is still less certain than the definitive truncation caused by a stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...-3’\n    *   The third codon, CTC (Leucine), is changed to TAC (Tyrosine). This is a single missense mutation, similar to Mutant 1. It results in an amino acid substitution that may or may not inactivate the protein.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most reliable way to eliminate the gene's function among the given choices is to introduce a premature stop codon. Mutant 2 is the only mutation that does this, leading to a truncated and non-functional protein. This makes it the most probable candidate to eliminate the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
