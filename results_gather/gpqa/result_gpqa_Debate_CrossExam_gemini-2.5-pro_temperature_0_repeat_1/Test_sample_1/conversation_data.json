    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\nThe first reaction involves treating trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide.\n\n*   **Trans-cinnamaldehyde (C₉H₈O)** is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde with a chemical formula of C₆H₅CH=CHCHO. It contains a total of **9 carbon atoms**.\n*   **Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr)** is a Grignard reagent. In reactions with α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, Grignard reagents typically perform a 1,2-addition, where the methyl group attacks the carbonyl carbon.\n*   This addition of a methyl group increases the carbon count by one. The aldehyde group is converted into a secondary alcohol.\n*   Product 1 is therefore **(E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol**, which has the chemical formula C₁₀H₁₂O.\n*   Thus, Product 1 has **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is then treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC).\n\n*   **Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)** is an oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones.\n*   Product 1, (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol, is a secondary alcohol.\n*   PCC oxidizes the secondary alcohol group in Product 1 to a ketone group, forming **(E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one** (also known as benzalacetone).\n*   This oxidation reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.\n*   Therefore, Product 2 has **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nFinally, Product 2 is treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane, also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent (dimethyloxosulfonium methylide), in DMSO.\n\n*   Product 2, (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   The **Corey-Chaykovsky reagent** reacts with α,β-unsaturated ketones to form cyclopropanes via a 1,4-conjugate addition.\n*   In this reaction, a methylene group (CH₂) from the sulfur ylide is added across the carbon-carbon double bond of the enone system.\n*   This adds one additional carbon atom to the molecule.\n*   Therefore, Product 3 will have 10 + 1 = **11 carbon atoms**.\n\nBased on the analysis of the three reaction steps, the final product, Product 3, contains 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
