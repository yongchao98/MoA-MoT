    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each type is equal. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this could mean each compound provides one type of aromatic proton and has the same number of them, or some other combination that results in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This indicates three distinct types of alkyl protons, all of which are singlets (implying no adjacent protons, characteristic of methyl groups not adjacent to other protons).\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They should produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are in three distinct chemical environments: Me(1) and Me(3) are equivalent, Me(2) is unique, and Me(5) is unique. This would result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry makes pairs of groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent to each other. However, they are adjacent (ortho), so they will couple and appear as a **pair of doublets**, not a singlet. This contradicts the problem description. However, for the sake of thoroughness, let's note it would be one signal area integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent and will produce **one singlet** integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The signal for the -CH2- protons will be a **quartet**, and the signal for the -CH3 protons will be a **triplet**. This contradicts the problem's description of only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the individual spectra, we can immediately rule out **1,4-diethylbenzene** because it would show triplets and quartets, not just singlets, in the alkyl region. We can also likely rule out **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** because its aromatic protons would produce doublets, not the singlets described in the problem.\n\nThis leaves **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** as the most likely candidates (Option A). Let's test this combination.\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in a total of **three** aromatic signals, which contradicts the data. Even if two signals overlapped, the integration ratios would not be 1:1.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction. Let's reconsider the alkyl region, which is more complex and thus more informative. The required ratio is **2:1:1**.\n\nLet's re-examine the mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Option D), and assume the term \"singlet\" for the aromatic region of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene was a simplification in the problem statement.\n\n*   **Mixture D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one signal for 2H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one signal for 2H.\n        *   This results in two signals with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides **one singlet** for **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides **two singlets**, each for **6H**.\n        *   In the mixture, we would see three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that produces the observed integration ratios in both the aromatic (1:1) and alkyl (2:1:1) regions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
