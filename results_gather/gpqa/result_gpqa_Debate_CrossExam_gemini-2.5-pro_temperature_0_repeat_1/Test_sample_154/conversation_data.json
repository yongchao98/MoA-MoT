    "**Proposer:** The goal is to find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$. The formula for uncertainty is $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$. My proposed solution path is to first calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, denoted as $\\langle P_z \\rangle$, and the expectation value of $P_z^2$, denoted as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$. Then, I will substitute these values into the uncertainty formula. The problem provides all the necessary matrices and the state vector, so this should be a direct calculation without needing external information.\n\n**Skeptic:** Your approach is standard. However, let's consider potential issues.\n1.  **State Vector Consistency:** The problem claims the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle = (-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)^T$ is an eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. It would be prudent to verify this first. If it's not, the problem statement is inconsistent.\n2.  **Basis:** The problem states the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. This is consistent with $P_z$ being a diagonal matrix. The calculation of expectation values $\\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$ must be performed correctly in this basis.\n3.  **Arithmetic Errors:** The calculations involve matrix-vector and vector-vector multiplication. These are straightforward but susceptible to simple arithmetic mistakes. Each step must be double-checked.\n\n**Decision:** The Skeptic's suggestion to first verify the state vector is a good practice for ensuring the problem is well-posed. After that, the plan is to proceed with the calculation of $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ and then find the uncertainty. Since this is a self-contained mathematical problem, no external search is required. I will perform the full calculation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\nThe state of the system is given by the column vector:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe operator $P_z$ is:\n$P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\nFirst, we apply the operator $P_z$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we calculate the inner product $\\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$. The bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$ is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right) = \\hbar (1/4 + 0 - 1/4) = 0$\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\nFirst, we find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right) = \\hbar^2 (1/4 + 0 + 1/4) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**3. Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n\nUsing the formula for uncertainty:\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
