    Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.

    Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:

    **Thermodynamics: Weaker in Basic Solutions**

    The strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive reduction potential indicates a stronger oxidizing agent.

    *   In an acidic solution, the reduction of oxygen is represented by the following half-reaction:
        O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)      E° = +1.23 V
    *   In a basic solution, the half-reaction is:
        O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)      E° = +0.40 V

    Since the standard reduction potential of oxygen in a basic solution (+0.40 V) is lower than in an acidic solution (+1.23 V), oxygen is a thermodynamically weaker oxidizing agent in basic conditions.

    **Kinetics: Slower in Acidic Solutions**

    The speed of a reaction is a matter of kinetics. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is known to have sluggish kinetics, which is a significant challenge in technologies like fuel cells.

    Several studies indicate that the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction are generally slower in acidic media compared to alkaline (basic) media. This is partly due to a higher overpotential required to drive the reaction in acidic environments. Research on various catalysts has shown better performance and faster reaction rates for oxygen reduction in alkaline solutions. One source explicitly states that alkaline media lead to faster electron transfer kinetics for the ORR when compared to acidic media.

    Therefore, the correct combination to complete the statement is "weaker" and "slower".
