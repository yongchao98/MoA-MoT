    "The correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is determined by applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms in different energy states under conditions of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (N_excited) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (N_lower):\n\n(N_excited / N_lower) = (g_excited / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   `g_excited` and `g_lower` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nThe problem states that iron atoms in star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star 2. This implies that the ratio of the population in the excited state to a lower state is twice as large for star 1 as it is for star 2.\n\nTherefore, we can write the relationship:\n(N_excited / N_lower)_1 = 2 * (N_excited / N_lower)_2\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:\n(g_e / g_l) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * (g_e / g_l) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\nThe statistical weights (g) are properties of the atom and are the same for both stars, so they cancel out:\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nRearranging the terms to isolate ln(2):\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. The Boltzmann constant, k, has a defined value of approximately 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n\nBy substituting these values, the ratio (ΔE / k) becomes:\n(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2) ]\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2) ]\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
