    This function checks the correctness of the given answer to a stereochemistry problem.
    It codifies the chemical principles and logical steps to derive the product and compares
    it to the provided answer.

    The reaction is:
    Reactant: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane
    Reagent: Me2CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate)
    Reaction: Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.

    Key Principles:
    1. Regioselectivity: Attack at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.
    2. Stereospecificity: SN2-like attack with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon.
    3. IUPAC Naming: The product must be renumbered according to IUPAC rules.
