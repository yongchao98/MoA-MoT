    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the luminosity ratio of the two stars.\n\n### 1. Understand the Relationship between Luminosity, Radius, and Temperature\nThe luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is:\n`L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`\nwhere:\n*   `R` is the radius of the star.\n*   `T` is the surface temperature of the star.\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 (L1) and Star 2 (L2), we can set up the following equation:\n`L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴)`\n\nBy canceling out the constants (`4`, `π`, and `σ`), we get:\n`L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n\n### 2. Determine the Ratio of the Radii\nThe problem states that the radius of Star 1 (R1) is 1.5 times the radius of Star 2 (R2).\n*   `R1 = 1.5 * R2`\n*   Therefore, `R1 / R2 = 1.5`\n\nSquaring this ratio gives:\n`(R1 / R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`\n\n### 3. Determine the Ratio of the Temperatures\nThis step requires considering both Wien's Displacement Law and the Doppler effect.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law states that the intrinsic peak emission wavelength (λ_rest) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T).\n    `λ_rest = b / T`, where `b` is Wien's constant.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving object is shifted. Since Star 2 is moving away from the observer (positive radial velocity), its light is redshifted, meaning the observed wavelength is longer than the intrinsic wavelength. The non-relativistic formula for this shift is:\n    `λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v / c)`\n    where `v` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars (`λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`).\n\n*   For Star 1, the radial velocity is 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its intrinsic wavelength: `λ_obs1 = λ_rest1`.\n*   For Star 2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its observed wavelength is: `λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2 / c)`.\n\nSince `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`, we have:\n`λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2 / c)`\n\nNow, we substitute Wien's Law (`λ_rest = b / T`) into this equation:\n`b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2 / c)`\n\nAfter canceling `b`, we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n`1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v2 / c)`\n`T2 / T1 = 1 + v2 / c`\n`T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2 / c)`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Numerical Value\nWe have the following values:\n*   `v2 = 700 km/s`\n*   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 299,792.458 km/s\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio `v2 / c`:\n`v2 / c = 700 / 299792.458 ≈ 0.002335`\n\nNow, calculate the temperature ratio `(T1 / T2)` and raise it to the fourth power:\n`T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + 0.002335) ≈ 0.99767`\n`(T1 / T2)⁴ ≈ (0.99767)⁴ ≈ 0.9907`\n\n### 5. Final Luminosity Ratio Calculation\nSubstitute the calculated ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n`L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.229`\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
