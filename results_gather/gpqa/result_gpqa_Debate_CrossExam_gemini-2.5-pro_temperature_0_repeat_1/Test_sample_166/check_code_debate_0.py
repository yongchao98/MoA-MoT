def check_cat_state_non_gaussianity():
    """
    This function verifies the calculation of non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given
    Schr√∂dinger cat state.

    The steps are as follows:
    1. Define the given parameters: alpha and phi.
    2. Confirm that for phi = -pi/4, the state is an "odd coherent state".
    3. For a pure state, the non-Gaussianity (del_b) simplifies to the von Neumann
       entropy of the reference Gaussian state, S(tau).
    4. S(tau) is calculated from the symplectic eigenvalue 'nu' of the state's
       covariance matrix V.
    5. The elements of V for an odd coherent state are calculated using known formulas.
    6. The symplectic eigenvalue is calculated as nu = sqrt(det(V)).
    7. The entropy S(tau) is calculated using the formula:
       S(tau) = (nu + 0.5) * ln(nu + 0.5) - (nu - 0.5) * ln(nu - 0.5).
    8. The final calculated value is compared with the provided answer.
