    "**Proposer's Initial Analysis**\n\nThe provided data is for a compound with the formula C9H11NO2.\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula corresponds to 5 degrees of unsaturation, suggesting a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (C=O or C=C).\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically an ester.\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two distinct doublets suggest one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) are the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene (-CH₂) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is consistent with the two protons of a primary amino group (-NH₂) attached to the aromatic ring. Its broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential chemical exchange.\n\n**Proposed Solution Path**\n\nBased on this analysis, the compound is likely ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (structure A). This structure contains a primary amine, an ester, an ethyl group, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, all of which are directly supported by the IR and NMR data. The electron-donating amino group would cause the adjacent aromatic protons to be shielded (appear upfield at ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group would cause its adjacent protons to be deshielded (appear downfield at ~8.0 ppm). This matches the observed spectrum. The next logical step is to confirm the spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination**\n\nThe initial analysis strongly favors ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (A). However, to be certain, let's verify the expected spectral data against published values for all candidates.\n\n1.  **Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (A):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A published spectrum shows peaks at δ 1.35 (t, 3H), 4.16 (s, br, 2H, -NH₂), 4.31 (q, 2H), 6.62 (d, 2H), and 7.84 (d, 2H). This is an excellent match to the provided data (1.20, 4.0, 4.5, 7.0, 8.0 ppm). Minor differences in chemical shifts are expected due to solvent effects and spectrometer calibration.\n    *   **IR:** A reference IR spectrum for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (also known as Benzocaine) shows characteristic N-H stretches for a primary amine around 3300-3230 cm⁻¹. This confirms the assignment of the bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. The C=O ester stretch is also confirmed to be in the expected region.\n\n2.  **4-aminophenyl propionate (B):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The key difference would be the chemical shift of the methylene protons of the ethyl group. In a propionate ester attached to a phenol, the -COCH₂CH₃ group would show a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm. This is significantly different from the 4.5 ppm observed in the data. The NMR spectrum for propionic acid shows this quartet at 2.17 ppm. This structure is inconsistent.\n\n3.  **N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide (C):**\n    *   **IR:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only *one* N-H stretch, not two. The provided data (3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹) is a clear indication of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** This structure has a formyl proton (-N-CHO) which would appear as a singlet far downfield, typically >8.0 ppm. This signal is absent. Furthermore, the ethoxy quartet (-OCH₂CH₃) in the related compound phenacetin appears at 4.0 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This structure is inconsistent.\n\n4.  **3-ethoxybenzamide (D):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** This structure has a 1,3- (meta) substitution pattern on the benzene ring. This would result in a more complex splitting pattern, not the two clean doublets characteristic of 1,4- (para) substitution seen in the data at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. The IR would show two N-H bands from the primary amide, but the NMR aromatic region is a clear mismatch.\n\n**Convergence and Final Decision**\n\nThe search results confirm the initial analysis. The IR and ¹H NMR data are highly characteristic of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The IR bands confirm a primary amine and a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR signals perfectly match the pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted ring bearing an amino group and an ethyl ester group. The spectral data for the other isomers are inconsistent with the provided information.\n\n<<<A>>>"
