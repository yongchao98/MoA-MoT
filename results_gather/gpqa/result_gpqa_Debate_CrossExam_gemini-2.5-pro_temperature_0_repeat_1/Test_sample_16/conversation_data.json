    "**Proposer**: My initial assessment is that this is a straightforward equilibrium calculation. The reaction is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex: [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻. We are given the initial concentration of the complex and the formation constant (Kf). I can calculate the dissociation constant (Kd = 1/Kf) and then use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. The problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which I interpret to mean that we don't need to worry about the protonation of EDTA and can assume the given Kf is the conditional formation constant under these ideal conditions.\n\n**Skeptic**: Your approach seems sound, as this is a typical complexometric equilibrium problem. The \"ideal pH\" simplification is common in academic questions to avoid the more complex calculations involving alpha fractions of EDTA, which are pH-dependent. My main concern is to ensure the correct application of the equilibrium formula and the validity of any simplifying assumptions. Specifically, after setting up the equation Kd = x² / (0.02 - x), you will likely assume that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02. We must verify this assumption after solving for x to ensure the result is accurate.\n\n**Decision**: I will proceed with the calculation as proposed. The consensus is that this is a standard equilibrium problem where the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is the key process. I will calculate the dissociation constant, set up the equilibrium expression, solve for the calcium ion concentration, and then confirm that the simplifying assumption made during the calculation is valid.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Understand the equilibrium:** The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equation:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the dissociation constant (Kd):** The formation constant (Kf) is given as 5x10¹⁰. The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    Kd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table:** Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺.\n    *   Initial concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 M\n    *   Initial concentration of Ca²⁺ = 0 M\n    *   Initial concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ = 0 M\n    *   At equilibrium, [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:**\n    Kd = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n    2x10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Apply a simplifying assumption:** Since Kd is very small, the dissociation is minimal, meaning x will be much smaller than 0.02. Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate x:**\n    x² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4x10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Verify the assumption:** The calculated value of x (6.32x10⁻⁷) is indeed significantly smaller than 0.02, so the approximation was valid.\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
