    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the chemistry equilibrium problem.

    The problem is to find the concentration of calcium ions [Ca2+] from a 0.02 M solution
    of Ca-EDTA complex, given the formation constant Kf = 5x10^10.

    The reaction is: [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

    The provided solution follows these steps:
    1. Calculate the dissociation constant, Kd = 1 / Kf.
    2. Set up an ICE table and the equilibrium expression: Kd = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻].
    3. With x = [Ca²⁺], this becomes Kd = x² / (0.02 - x).
    4. Use the approximation that x is small, so Kd ≈ x² / 0.02.
    5. Solve for x.
    6. The result is compared with the given options.
