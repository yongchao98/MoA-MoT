    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) in the solution, the following steps are taken:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each component:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    The solution is a buffer system composed of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used to find the pH, and from there, the [H⁺].\n\n    pH = pKa₂ + log ( [HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻] )\n\n    First, calculate pKa₂:\n    pKa₂ = -log(Ka₂) = -log(6.2x10⁻⁸) ≈ 7.21\n\n    Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 7.21 + log ( 0.02809 / 0.03674 )\n    pH = 7.21 + log(0.7646)\n    pH = 7.21 - 0.1166 ≈ 7.09\n\n    Next, calculate the hydrogen ion concentration:\n    [H⁺] = 10⁻⁷.⁰⁹ ≈ 8.13x10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    The concentration of the orthophosphate ion is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which is governed by Ka₃.\n\n    Ka₃ = ( [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] ) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = ( Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] ) / [H⁺]\n\n    Now, substitute the known values:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = ( 1.8x10⁻¹² * 0.02809 ) / ( 8.13x10⁻⁸ )\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.22x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis calculated value is closest to 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
