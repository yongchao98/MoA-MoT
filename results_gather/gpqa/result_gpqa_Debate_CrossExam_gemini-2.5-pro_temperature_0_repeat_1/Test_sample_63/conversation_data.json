    "Proposer: The problem requires us to identify two salts, A and B, based on their decomposition products. The first step is to analyze the information from the three tubes and the remaining gas to determine the chemical composition and molar quantities of the gaseous products.\n\nSkeptic: This approach seems logical. However, we must be careful with our assumptions. The identity of gas C is not explicitly given, and the decomposition reactions of the initial salts can be complex and temperature-dependent. We need to ensure our deductions are consistent across all given data points (mass changes, gas volume, etc.).\n\nProposer: I will start by calculating the moles of the substances absorbed or reacted in each tube and the moles of the final gas C. This is a direct calculation from the data provided and involves no assumptions yet.\n\nProposer:\nBased on the search results and chemical principles, I can now determine the products of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase is 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of water (H₂O) is approximately 18.015 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** The weight did not change, which means no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** This tube's weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   The gas passing through would be molecular oxygen (O₂). The molar mass of an oxygen atom is ~16.00 g/mol, so the molar mass of O₂ is ~32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n4.  **Gas C:** This is the remaining gas. Its volume is 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   The molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\nNow, I will determine the identity of Gas C by calculating its molar mass. The total initial mass was 7.20 g. By conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the products.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is inert in this series of reactions is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\nMy next step is to determine the empirical formula of the initial salt mixture from these products and then deduce the formulas of salts A and B.\n\nSkeptic:\nYour analysis of the products seems sound. The identification of Gas C as N₂ is well-supported. The crucial step is now identifying the two initial salts. You have the total elemental composition of the mixture (N, H, O), but you need to partition it into two distinct, equimolar salts that are chemically plausible. The decomposition reactions you will need to assume must also be plausible for the given conditions.\n\nProposer:\nI will now determine the total moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original mixture. From there, I will deduce the formulas of the two equimolar salts, A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol H₂O -> 0.20 * 2 = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol N₂ -> 0.10 * 2 = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol H₂O + 0.025 mol O₂ -> (0.20 * 1) + (0.025 * 2) = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe initial mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. Since salts A and B are in an equimolar mixture, let's say we have 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B. The total moles of N are 0.20, so 2n * (average N atoms per salt) = 0.20.\n\nLet's consider the simplest case where the total moles of salts are 0.10 mol (0.05 mol A + 0.05 mol B).\nThis would mean the total formula of the mixture (A+B) contains:\n*   N: 0.20 mol / 0.05 = 4\n*   H: 0.40 mol / 0.05 = 8\n*   O: 0.25 mol / 0.05 = 5\nSo, the combined formula is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nWe need to split N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salts. Common salts containing these elements are ammonium salts. The NH₄⁺ ion accounts for NH₄.\n*   If we have two ammonium salts, we use 2 * NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n*   The remaining atoms for the two anions are N₂O₅.\n*   The two most common oxyanions of nitrogen are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ = N₂O₅.\n\nThis fits perfectly. So, the salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate)\n*   **Salt B:** NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite)\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe molar ratio of products from these reactions (N₂ : O₂ : H₂O) is (1+1) : (1/2) : (2+2) for every 1 mole of B and 1 mole of A (in the 2NH4NO3 form), which simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8.\nOur experimental molar ratio is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.10 : 0.025 : 0.20, which also simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8. The hypothesis is consistent.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n*   Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n*   Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   Total atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nSkeptic:\nThe logic is consistent and all data points are accounted for. The assumed decomposition of ammonium nitrate to N₂, O₂, and H₂O is non-standard at 200°C, but within the context of a stoichiometry problem where the products are clearly defined by the analytical tests, this is a required inference. The conclusion seems solid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
