    "**Proposer:** The goal is to find the eigenvector of the operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ with eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane.\n\nFirst, I will define the operator. A general unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the z-axis. Its components are $n_x = \\sin(\\theta)$, $n_y = 0$, and $n_z = \\cos(\\theta)$.\n\nThe operator $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ is therefore $P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$.\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{n}$ and the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x \\sin(\\theta) + P_z \\cos(\\theta)$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin(\\theta) + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta)$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) & \\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta) & -\\cos(\\theta) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nMy proposed action is to solve the eigenvalue equation $P_{\\vec{n}} |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$, using the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n\n**Skeptic:** The formulation of the operator $P_{\\vec{n}}$ seems correct, assuming the standard definition of the polar angle $\\theta$ with respect to the z-axis. The next step is to solve the eigenvalue equation. This will result in a system of linear equations for the components of the eigenvector, $a$ and $b$. We must ensure the algebra is handled correctly, especially the trigonometric identities. We also need to remember the final step, which is to normalize the resulting eigenvector so that $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$. Let's check the options. Options A and D contain $\\hbar$, which is incorrect for the components of a normalized state vector, so they can be eliminated. The choice is between B and C. The calculation will reveal whether the dependency is on $\\theta$ or $\\theta/2$.\n\n**Decide:** The proposed path is sound. The next logical step is to execute the plan: solve the eigenvalue equation and normalize the result. No external search is needed as this is a self-contained mathematical problem.\n\n**Proposer:** I will now solve the eigenvalue equation.\n$P_{\\vec{n}} |\\psi\\rangle = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2} |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) & \\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta) & -\\cos(\\theta) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nCanceling $\\hbar/2$ from both sides, we get a system of two equations:\n1) $a \\cos(\\theta) + b \\sin(\\theta) = a \\implies b \\sin(\\theta) = a(1 - \\cos(\\theta))$\n2) $a \\sin(\\theta) - b \\cos(\\theta) = b \\implies a \\sin(\\theta) = b(1 + \\cos(\\theta))$\n\nUsing the first equation:\n$b = a \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}{\\sin(\\theta)}$\n\nUsing the half-angle identities $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin(\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$:\n$b = a \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo the eigenvector is of the form $|\\psi\\rangle = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNow, I will normalize it. The condition is $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n$|a|^2 + |a \\tan(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n$|a|^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nUsing the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n$|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1 \\implies |a|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n\nChoosing the real, positive root, we get $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\nThen, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n\nThe normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Skeptic:** The derivation is clear and uses standard trigonometric identities correctly. The resulting eigenvector $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ matches option C. The initial dismissal of options A and D was correct, and this calculation confirms that the components depend on $\\theta/2$, not $\\theta$, ruling out option B. The solution seems robust.\n\n**Convergence:** The calculation is complete and verified. The resulting eigenvector matches one of the provided options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
