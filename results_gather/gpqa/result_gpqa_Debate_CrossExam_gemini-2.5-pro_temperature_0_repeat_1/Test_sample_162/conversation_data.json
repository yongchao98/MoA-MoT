    "Proposer: To solve this problem, we first need to understand the chemical reaction that occurs. Ferric hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, is a sparingly soluble base that reacts with a strong acid (let's denote it as HA, which provides H⁺ ions) in a neutralization reaction. The reaction is:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nTo calculate the minimum volume of the acid required, we need to find the stoichiometric amount of H⁺ ions needed to react completely with 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃. This requires the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n\nOnce the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved, we will have a solution of Fe³⁺ ions in a total volume of 100 cm³. The Fe³⁺ ion is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water, establishing an equilibrium that determines the final pH of the solution:\n\nFe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\nTo calculate the pH, we will need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this hydrolysis reaction.\n\nTherefore, the first step is to gather these fundamental constants.\n\nSkeptic: This approach seems logical. We are assuming that the \"minimum volume\" corresponds to the exact stoichiometric amount needed for the neutralization reaction. Any less acid would result in incomplete dissolution. The subsequent pH calculation due to hydrolysis of the resulting ferric ion is also a critical step. We must ensure we find the correct Ka value for the hydrated Fe³⁺ ion at or near the specified temperature of 25°C. Let's proceed with finding the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ and the Ka for Fe³⁺.\n\nProposer: The search results provide the necessary constants.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** The consensus from multiple sources is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n*   **Ka for Fe³⁺ hydrolysis:** One source gives the pKa of Fe³⁺ as about 2.2. Another, more detailed study, reports the first hydrolysis constant (for Fe³⁺ + H₂O ⇌ FeOH²⁺ + H⁺) as log(β₁) = -2.19. This corresponds to a pKa of 2.19. Ka would then be 10⁻².¹⁹.\n\nNow I can proceed with the calculations.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃**\nMoles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol\n\n**Step 2: Calculate moles of H⁺ needed**\nFrom the stoichiometry Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺, the moles of H⁺ are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid**\nVolume (L) = moles of H⁺ / concentration of acid (0.1 M)\nThen convert the volume from L to cm³ (1 L = 1000 cm³).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the initial concentration of Fe³⁺**\nThe moles of Fe³⁺ formed are equal to the initial moles of Fe(OH)₃. The final volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n[Fe³⁺] = moles of Fe³⁺ / 0.1 L\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the equilibrium pH**\nUsing the hydrolysis reaction: Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\nAnd the Ka expression: Ka = [H⁺][Fe(OH)²⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\nWe can set up an ICE table:\nInitial: [Fe³⁺] | 0 | 0\nChange: -x | +x | +x\nEquilibrium: [Fe³⁺] - x | x | x\nSo, Ka = x² / ([Fe³⁺] - x). We can solve this for x, which is [H⁺], and then calculate pH = -log[H⁺].\n\nI will now perform these calculations.\n\nSkeptic: The plan is solid. The constants seem reliable. The only potential pitfall is the assumption that the contribution of H⁺ from the acid used for dissolution does not affect the final pH. However, the problem states the *total* volume is 100 cm³, which includes the volume of acid added. This means the final solution contains only the products of the neutralization (Fe³⁺ and water) diluted to 100 cm³. Therefore, the only source of H⁺ for the final pH calculation is indeed the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺. The calculation should be straightforward. Let's proceed.\n\nProposer:\n**Calculations:**\n\n1.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.0009357 moles\n\n2.  **Moles of H⁺ needed:**\n    3 * 0.0009357 moles = 0.0028071 moles H⁺\n\n3.  **Volume of 0.1 M acid:**\n    Volume (L) = 0.0028071 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028071 L\n    Volume (cm³) = 0.028071 L * 1000 cm³/L = **28.07 cm³**\n\n4.  **Concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    Moles of Fe³⁺ = 0.0009357 moles\n    Total volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n    [Fe³⁺] = 0.0009357 moles / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M\n\n5.  **pH calculation:**\n    Ka = 10⁻².¹⁹ = 0.006457\n    Ka = x² / (0.009357 - x), where x = [H⁺]\n    0.006457 = x² / (0.009357 - x)\n    x² + 0.006457x - (0.006457 * 0.009357) = 0\n    x² + 0.006457x - 0.00006041 = 0\n\n    Solving the quadratic equation for x (using the quadratic formula x = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/2a):\n    x = [-0.006457 ± sqrt(0.006457² - 4*1*(-0.00006041))] / 2\n    x = [-0.006457 ± sqrt(0.00004169 + 0.00024164)] / 2\n    x = [-0.006457 ± sqrt(0.00028333)] / 2\n    x = [-0.006457 ± 0.016832] / 2\n    Since x must be positive, x = ( -0.006457 + 0.016832) / 2 = 0.010375 / 2 = 0.0051875 M\n    [H⁺] = 0.0051875 M\n\n    pH = -log(0.0051875) = **2.28**\n\nLet me re-check the options. My calculated volume is ~28.07 cm³, which matches option A. My calculated pH is 2.28, which is close to 2.04 in option A. Let me re-evaluate the Ka. The pKa was \"about 2.2\". Let's see what pH I get if I use the pH from option A and work backwards.\n\nIf pH = 2.04, then [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ = 0.00912 M.\nLet's see if this fits the Ka equation.\nKa = (0.00912)² / (0.009357 - 0.00912) = 0.00008317 / 0.000237 = 0.35. This gives a pKa of 0.45, which is very different from 2.2.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem. What if the acid volume is one of the other options?\nLet's assume the answer is D: 30.09 cm³.\nThis implies moles of H⁺ = 0.1 M * 0.03009 L = 0.003009 moles.\nThis would mean moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.003009 / 3 = 0.001003 moles.\nMass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.001003 moles * 106.87 g/mol = 0.107 g. This is close to 0.1g. Let's use this value.\nIf we use 30.09 cm³ of acid, there is a slight excess of H⁺.\nMoles of H⁺ added = 0.003009 mol.\nMoles of H⁺ consumed = 3 * (0.1 / 106.87) = 0.002807 mol.\nExcess moles of H⁺ = 0.003009 - 0.002807 = 0.000202 mol.\nConcentration of excess H⁺ = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\nNow we also have the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺.\n[Fe³⁺] = (0.1 / 106.87) / 0.1 = 0.009357 M.\nThe hydrolysis will produce more H⁺.\nTotal [H⁺] = [H⁺] from excess acid + [H⁺] from hydrolysis.\nThis becomes a common ion effect problem.\nKa = ([H⁺]from hydrolysis + [H⁺]excess) * [Fe(OH)²⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\nLet y be [H⁺] from hydrolysis.\nKa = (y + 0.00202) * y / (0.009357 - y)\n0.006457 = (y² + 0.00202y) / (0.009357 - y)\nThis is getting complicated and suggests the \"minimum volume\" should be the stoichiometric one.\n\nLet's stick to the first calculation.\nVolume = 28.07 cm³. This strongly points towards option A.\nLet's re-calculate the pH using a slightly different Ka. What if the pKa is slightly higher, leading to a lower pH? No, a higher pKa means a weaker acid and less H⁺, so a higher pH.\nWhat if the pKa is lower? pKa = 2.0. Ka = 10⁻² = 0.01.\nx² + 0.01x - (0.01 * 0.009357) = 0\nx² + 0.01x - 0.00009357 = 0\nx = [-0.01 ± sqrt(0.01² - 4*(-0.00009357))] / 2\nx = [-0.01 ± sqrt(0.0001 + 0.00037428)] / 2\nx = [-0.01 ± sqrt(0.00047428)] / 2\nx = [-0.01 ± 0.02177] / 2\nx = 0.01177 / 2 = 0.005885 M\npH = -log(0.005885) = 2.23.\n\nThe calculation for the volume of acid seems robust: 28.07 cm³. This is very close to 28.05 cm³ in option A. The discrepancy in pH might be due to using a slightly different value for the molar mass or the Ka constant in the source of the problem. However, given the multiple-choice options, the calculated volume is a very strong indicator. The calculated pH of ~2.2-2.3 is also in the same ballpark as 2.04, whereas the other options have vastly different pH values.\n\nLet's re-calculate the volume using the molar mass from another source, e.g., 106.88 g/mol.\nMoles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 / 106.88 = 0.0009356 mol\nMoles H⁺ = 3 * 0.0009356 = 0.0028068 mol\nVolume acid = 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³. This is still closest to 28.05 cm³.\n\nLet's assume the volume 28.05 cm³ from option A is correct and see what that implies for the molar mass.\nVolume = 0.02805 L\nMoles H⁺ = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol\nMoles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.002805 / 3 = 0.000935 mol\nMolar Mass = 0.1 g / 0.000935 mol = 106.95 g/mol. This is a reasonable value.\n\nLet's assume the pH of 2.04 from option A is correct and see what that implies for the Ka.\n[H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ = 0.00912 M\n[Fe³⁺]initial = 0.00935 M (using the moles derived from the volume)\nKa = x² / ([Fe³⁺] - x) = (0.00912)² / (0.00935 - 0.00912) = 0.00008317 / 0.00023 = 0.36.\nThis implies a pKa of 0.44. This is significantly different from the literature value of ~2.2.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement's options. However, the calculation for the required volume of acid is a direct stoichiometric calculation and is less prone to variations from equilibrium constants. My calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the volume in option A (28.05 cm³). The other volume options (20.40, 32.14, 30.09) are not close. Therefore, based on the stoichiometric calculation, option A is the most plausible answer, despite the discrepancy in the pH value which likely arises from the problem using a non-standard Ka value.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Moles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n2.  Moles H⁺ needed = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n3.  Volume of 0.1 M acid = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.\nThis matches the volume in option A.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the pH calculation. Is it possible that the second hydrolysis step is significant?\nFe(OH)²⁺ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₂⁺ + H⁺\nThe log constant for this is -5.76. This is a much smaller Ka, so its contribution should be negligible.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that the volume calculation is the intended key to the answer. The pH value provided in the option might be slightly off due to the specific constants used by the source. Based on the strong agreement of the calculated volume, I will select A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
