    Checks the correctness of the answer to the quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem involves the energy-time uncertainty principle. To clearly resolve
    two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the
    sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths).

    The energy uncertainty (linewidth) ΔE is related to the lifetime τ by:
    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ
    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

    The condition for resolvability is:
    |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2
