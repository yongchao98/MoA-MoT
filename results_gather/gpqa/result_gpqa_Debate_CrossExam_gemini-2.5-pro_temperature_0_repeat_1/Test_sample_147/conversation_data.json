    "Here is a self-debate to determine the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n\n**Proposer:** My initial goal is to identify element Y by using the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2, which is 31.96%. The formula for mass percentage is ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F)), where n is the number of fluorine atoms, M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19 g/mol), and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\nBy rearranging the formula, I get M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n\nI will now test integer values for 'n':\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium)\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Bromine)\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (similar to Antimony)\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no stable element)\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (near Gold, Mercury)\n\nThe most promising candidates are Bromine (Br) and Antimony (Sb). I will start by investigating Bromine.\n\nMy first action is to perform a search to verify the known binary fluorides of Bromine and Antimony and their properties to see how they match the clues.\n\n**Skeptic:** The search results provide good information. For Antimony (Y=Sb), the main fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. The mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is 31.88%, which is an excellent match for A2 (31.96%). However, the properties of A1 don't match. A1 is \"bright-red\" and decomposes at room temperature (293 K). If A1 is SbF₅, it is described as a colorless liquid and is relatively stable. This is a major contradiction.\n\nFor Bromine (Y=Br), the main fluorides are BrF, BrF₃, and BrF₅. The clue about \"five binary compounds\" is plausible if we include ions or radicals like BrF₂, BrF₄. If we test the stable fluorides for the mass percentage of A2 (31.96%), none are a good match. However, the radical BrF₂ would have a fluorine percentage of ~32.2%, which is a very close match. This path involves unstable species but seems numerically possible.\n\n**Proposer:** The Skeptic has raised valid points. The antimony hypothesis has a perfect numerical fit for A2 but fails on the qualitative description of A1. The bromine hypothesis requires considering A2 as a radical (BrF₂) to fit the numbers, which is unconventional but possible.\n\nLet's explore the bromine hypothesis further, as it might resolve all the clues. If Y=Br and A2=BrF₂, then A1 (which decomposes to A2+F₂) would be the BrF₄ radical. The reaction Y + A4 -> A5 becomes Br₂ + A4 -> A5. The other known fluorides are BrF, BrF₃, and BrF₅. A4 must be the oxidant, so it could be BrF₃ or BrF₅. Let's check their molecular weights against the options.\n*   M(BrF₃) ≈ 136.9 g/mol.\n*   M(BrF₅) ≈ 174.9 g/mol.\n\nThe range for option A is 160-180. The molecular weight of BrF₅ (174.9 g/mol) falls squarely in this range. This makes A4 = BrF₅ a very strong candidate.\n\nMy next action is to verify the remaining clues with this assignment.\n\n**Skeptic:** This path looks promising because it leads to one of the options. However, we are assuming A1 and A2 are radicals. We also need to check the final clue: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" If Y=Br, A4=BrF₅, the reaction is Br₂ + BrF₅ -> A5. This would be a comproportionation reaction, so A5 would likely be BrF₃. Does BrF₃ decompose in water to form two substances? The search results confirm this: BrF₃ reacts with water to form acids like HBrO₃ and HF. This fits. The main weaknesses are the radical nature of A1/A2 and the \"bright-red\" color, which is unknown for the BrF₄ radical.\n\n**Proposer:** The Bromine hypothesis (Y=Br) provides a consistent explanation for all the clues, assuming A2 is the BrF₂ radical.\n1.  **Y = Bromine (Br)**.\n2.  **A2 = BrF₂** (radical). Its calculated fluorine percentage (~32.2%) is very close to the given 31.96%.\n3.  **A1 = BrF₄** (radical). It decomposes to A2 (BrF₂) and fluorine. As a highly unstable radical, it would be a powerful oxidizing agent, capable of reacting with xenon. The \"bright-red\" color is the only unconfirmed property.\n4.  **A3** is a fluoride of bromine (e.g., BrF₃ or BrF₅), which are known strong fluorinating agents that can react with xenon.\n5.  **A4 = BrF₅**. Its molecular weight is ~174.9 g/mol, which fits the range 160-180.\n6.  **A5 = BrF₃**. It is obtained from the reaction of Br₂ (Y) and BrF₅ (A4). It decomposes in water to form two substances (e.g., bromic acid and hydrofluoric acid), which fits the final clue.\n\nThis path successfully identifies all compounds and leads to a molecular weight for A4 that matches one of the options.\n\n**Decision:** The next action is to finalize the answer based on this coherent hypothesis.\n\n<<<A>>>"
