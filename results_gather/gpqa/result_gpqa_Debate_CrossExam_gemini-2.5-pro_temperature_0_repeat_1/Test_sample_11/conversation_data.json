    "**Proposer:** The problem asks for the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (νμ). This is a classic two-body decay problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial pion is at rest, the total initial energy is its rest energy (139.6 MeV), and the initial momentum is zero. The two product particles must therefore move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. By applying the conservation laws, we can solve for the energies and momenta of the final particles. I will search for the standard formula or a worked example of this decay to ensure the methodology is correct.\n\n**Skeptic:** The search results confirm the general approach. Specifically, result mentions that for this two-particle decay, the products have definite energies, and it gives a value of 4.13 MeV for the kinetic energy of the muon, assuming a massless neutrino. Result provides a step-by-step calculation, arriving at 4.08 MeV for the muon's kinetic energy and 29.65 MeV for the neutrino's kinetic energy. Result also gives the momentum of the products as 29.792 MeV/c. These values are all very close to option A. The assumption of a massless neutrino is standard for this type of problem. The slight variations in the calculated values in the search results are likely due to using slightly different values for the rest masses of the pion and muon.\n\n**Proposer:** I agree. The search results have validated the proposed method. The physics is sound, and the assumption of a massless neutrino is appropriate. The minor differences in the results compared to my initial calculation can be attributed to the precision of the rest mass values used in those sources. I will now perform the calculation using the exact numbers provided in the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Define variables from the question:**\n    *   Rest energy of Pi(+) (m_π * c²): 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of mu(+) (m_μ * c²): 105.7 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of neutrino (m_ν * c²): 0 MeV (assumed)\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is 0.\n    *   The muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momentum. Let the magnitude of their momentum be 'p'.\n    *   p_μ = p_ν = p\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Initial Energy (E_initial) = Rest energy of pion = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n    *   Final Energy (E_final) = Total energy of muon (E_μ) + Total energy of neutrino (E_ν)\n    *   E_μ = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²)\n    *   E_ν = p*c (since the neutrino is massless)\n    *   Therefore: m_π * c² = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²) + p*c\n\n4.  **Solve for the momentum (p*c):**\n    *   Rearrange the energy equation: m_π * c² - p*c = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²)\n    *   Square both sides: (m_π * c² - p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   Expand the left side: (m_π * c²)² - 2(m_π * c²)(p*c) + (p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   Simplify by canceling (p*c)²: (m_π * c²)² - 2(m_π * c²)(p*c) = (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   Isolate the momentum term: p*c = [(m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)²] / [2 * m_π * c²]\n    *   Substitute values: p*c = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\n    *   p*c = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\n    *   p*c = 8315.67 / 279.2\n    *   p*c ≈ 29.784 MeV\n\n5.  **Calculate Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   **KE of neutrino (KE_ν):** For a massless particle, KE = Total Energy = p*c.\n        *   KE_ν ≈ 29.784 MeV. This rounds to **29.8 MeV**.\n    *   **KE of muon (KE_μ):** KE = Total Energy - Rest Energy = E_μ - m_μ * c². From energy conservation, E_μ = m_π * c² - E_ν.\n        *   KE_μ = (m_π * c²) - E_ν - (m_μ * c²)\n        *   KE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 29.784 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n        *   KE_μ ≈ 4.116 MeV. This rounds to **4.12 MeV**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
