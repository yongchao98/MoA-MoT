    Checks the correctness of the answer based on the biological context of yeast mating response.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Shmoo formation induces G1 cell cycle arrest.
    2. In G1 arrest for mating, transcription is highly active, while DNA replication is inhibited.
    3. The experiment (ChIP-MS of active chromatin) enriches for proteins involved in active processes, primarily transcription.
    4. Therefore, complexes for inhibited processes will be least abundant.
