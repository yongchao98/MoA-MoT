    # 1. Conductor is initially uncharged.

    # 2. A charge '+q' is placed inside the cavity.
    charge_in_cavity = q
    # 3. The outer surface is a sphere.
    # 4. The point P is outside the conductor at distance L from its center.

    # --- Applying Physics Principles ---

    # Principle 1: Gauss's Law inside the conductor.
    # The field inside the conductor material is zero. A Gaussian surface inside the
    # conductor enclosing the cavity must have zero net flux.
    # This implies the charge induced on the inner cavity surface is the negative
    # of the charge enclosed.
    charge_on_inner_surface = -charge_in_cavity

    # Principle 2: Conservation of Charge.
    # The total charge of the isolated conductor remains constant.
    # Total Charge = Charge on inner surface + Charge on outer surface
    # Charge on outer surface = Initial Charge - Charge on inner surface
    charge_on_outer_surface = initial_conductor_charge - charge_on_inner_surface
    
    # In this specific problem:
    # charge_on_outer_surface = 0 - (-q) = q
    calculated_outer_charge = q

    # Principle 3: Electrostatic Shielding and Shell Theorem.
    # The electric field outside a spherical conductor is determined solely by the
    # charge on its outer surface.
    # Because the outer surface is a sphere, the charge 'q' distributes uniformly.
    # The field of a uniformly charged sphere at an external point (distance L from center)
    # is the same as a point charge at the center.
    
    # Expected formula for the electric field E at point P
    expected_E = k * calculated_outer_charge / L**2
