    # very difficult and low-yield, a major flaw in a "high-yield" synthesis path.

    # Step iv) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) is proposed. The molecule at step iii is
    # 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. Diazotization requires a primary
    # aromatic amine (-NH2) group, which is not present. The step is impossible.
