    "**Proposer**: I have found the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. The results are quite consistent. A 2013 study published in *Nature* determined the distance to be 49.97 kpc (163,000 light-years) with an accuracy of 2.2%. Other sources confirm this, giving values of 163,000 light-years or around 160,000 light-years. I will use 163,000 light-years for our calculation. Now that we have the distance, I can proceed with the physics calculations. I will calculate the time in the Earth's reference frame and then use the Lorentz factor to find the time for the astronaut.\n\n**Skeptic**: The distance seems reliable. The next step is the calculation, which is sensitive due to the velocity being extremely close to the speed of light. The Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²), will be a very large number. A small error in calculating the term `1 - (v/c)²` can lead to a large error in the final answer. We must be precise. After calculating the astronaut's travel time (the proper time), we must compare it to their remaining lifespan (150 - 22 = 128 years) to determine if they would survive the journey.\n\n**Decided Action**: I have all the necessary information to solve the problem. I will now perform the calculations.\n\n1.  **Distance (d):** 163,000 light-years.\n2.  **Velocity (v):** 0.99999987 * c.\n3.  **Time in Earth's frame (Δt):**\n    Δt = distance / velocity = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\n    Since 1 light-year = c * 1 year,\n    Δt ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 years ≈ 163,000.021 years.\n4.  **Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\n    Let β = v/c = 0.99999987.\n    1 - β² = (1 - β)(1 + β)\n    1 - β = 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013 = 1.3 x 10⁻⁷\n    1 + β = 1 + 0.99999987 = 1.99999987 ≈ 2\n    1 - β² ≈ (1.3 x 10⁻⁷) * 2 = 2.6 x 10⁻⁷\n    √(1 - β²) ≈ √(2.6 x 10⁻⁷) ≈ 0.0005099\n    γ = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1961.16\n5.  **Time for the astronaut (Δt₀):**\n    Δt₀ = Δt / γ ≈ 163,000.021 / 1961.16 ≈ 83.11 years.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The journey would take approximately 83.11 years from the astronaut's perspective. The astronaut is 22 years old and has a lifespan of 150 years, meaning they can live for another 128 years. Since 83.11 years is less than 128 years, the astronaut will survive. The calculated time of ~83 years is closest to option C.\n\nLet's re-run the calculation with higher precision.\nv/c = 0.99999987\n(v/c)^2 = 0.9999997400000169\n1 - (v/c)^2 = 2.599999831e-7\nsqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 0.00050990193478\nγ = 1 / 0.00050990193478 = 1961.1687\nTime on Earth (Δt) = 163000 / 0.99999987 = 163000.02119 years\nTime for astronaut (Δt₀) = Δt / γ = 163000.02119 / 1961.1687 ≈ 83.114 years.\n\nThis is very close to 81 years, but let's check the other options. It's possible the intended answer uses a slightly different distance or there's a nuance I'm missing. Let's re-evaluate based on the provided options.\n\nMaybe the intended distance was slightly different. Let's work backwards from the answer options.\nIf Δt₀ = 81 years:\nΔt = Δt₀ * γ = 81 * 1961.1687 ≈ 158854.66 years.\nThis would correspond to a distance of d = Δt * v ≈ 158854.66 * 0.99999987c ≈ 158,854 light-years. This is a plausible distance, within the margin of error of astronomical measurements. Let's check the other options.\n\nIf Δt₀ = 77 years:\nΔt = 77 * 1961.1687 ≈ 151010 years. Distance ≈ 151,000 light-years.\nIf Δt₀ = 72 years:\nΔt = 72 * 1961.1687 ≈ 141204 years. Distance ≈ 141,200 light-years.\n\nThe distance of ~160,000 light-years is a very common figure for the LMC. Let's use that.\nd = 160,000 light-years\nΔt = 160000 / 0.99999987 = 160000.0208 years\nΔt₀ = 160000.0208 / 1961.1687 ≈ 81.58 years.\n\nThis value is very close to 81 years. It seems the question intended for a distance of approximately 160,000 light-years.\n\nFinal check:\n- Astronaut's age at start: 22\n- Journey time (astronaut's perspective): ~81.6 years\n- Astronaut's age at arrival: 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years\n- Alien lifespan: 150 years\n- Conclusion: The astronaut survives.\n- The calculated time of ~81.6 years strongly points to 81 years as the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
