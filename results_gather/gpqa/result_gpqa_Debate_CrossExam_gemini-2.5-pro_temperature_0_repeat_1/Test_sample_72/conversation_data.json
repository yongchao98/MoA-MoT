    "Proposer: The problem requires us to calculate the relative speed and the total energy of a system of two astronauts with given masses and relativistic speeds. I'll start by finding the formula for the relativistic relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction.\n\nSkeptic: While finding the formula for relative speed is a good first step, we also need the formula for the total relativistic energy of a system of particles. Is the total energy simply the sum of the individual relativistic energies, or are there other factors to consider? We should look for both formulas to be efficient. Also, we need to be careful about the signs in the velocity-addition formula, as both astronauts are moving in the same direction.\n\nDecide: I will search for the formulas for both relativistic relative velocity and the total energy of a system of particles. This will ensure accuracy for both parts of the problem.Proposer: The search results confirm the necessary formulas. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities u and v, the relative velocity is given by `v_rel = (v - u) / (1 - uv/c^2)`. The total relativistic energy of a system of non-interacting particles is the sum of their individual relativistic energies. The relativistic energy for a single particle is `E = γmc^2`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`. I will now proceed with the calculations.\n\nSkeptic: The formulas seem correct. However, the calculation of `γ` (the Lorentz factor) and the subsequent energy calculations can be prone to arithmetic errors. It's crucial to perform these calculations carefully for each astronaut and then sum them. A small mistake in any of these steps will lead to an incorrect final answer.\n\nDecide: I have the correct and verified formulas. The next logical step is to substitute the given values into these formulas and calculate the relative speed and total energy. I will perform the calculations in a step-by-step manner to minimize the risk of errors.Proposer: I have all the necessary information and formulas. I will now perform the final calculations for both the relative speed and the total energy to determine the correct option.\n\n**1. Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel):**\n\n*   v1 = 0.6c\n*   v2 = 0.5c\n*   The formula for relative velocity when objects move in the same direction is:\n    v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n*   Substituting the values:\n    v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\n    v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\n    v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n    v_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nThis rounds to **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy (E_total):**\n\n*   The total energy is the sum of the individual relativistic energies: E_total = E1 + E2.\n*   The formula for relativistic energy is E = γmc², where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).\n\n*   **For astronaut 1:**\n    *   m1 = 2m\n    *   v1 = 0.6c\n    *   γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n    *   E1 = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n*   **For astronaut 2:**\n    *   m2 = 3m\n    *   v2 = 0.5c\n    *   γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547\n    *   E2 = γ2 * m2 * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\n*   **Total Energy:**\n    *   E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc² = 5.9641 mc²\n\nThis rounds to **5.96 mc²**.\n\nSkeptic: The calculations appear to be correct. The relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². This matches one of the provided options.\n\nDecide: The calculated values for relative speed (v_rel ≈ 0.14c) and total energy (E ≈ 5.96 mc²) align with option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
