    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of H⁺ ions:**\n    *   From HCl: 500 mL (or 0.5 L) of 0.2 M HCl contains 0.5 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol of H⁺.\n    *   From H₂SO₄: 300 mL (or 0.3 L) of 0.3 M H₂SO₄ contains 0.3 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = 0.18 mol of H⁺ (since H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid).\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of OH⁻ ions:**\n    *   From Ba(OH)₂: 200 mL (or 0.2 L) of 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ contains 0.2 L × 0.5 mol/L × 2 = 0.2 mol of OH⁻ (since Ba(OH)₂ provides two hydroxide ions per formula unit).\n\n3.  **Determine the limiting reactant for the neutralization reaction:**\n    *   The neutralization reaction is H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l).\n    *   Comparing the moles of H⁺ (0.28 mol) and OH⁻ (0.20 mol), the hydroxide ion (OH⁻) is the limiting reactant.\n    *   Therefore, 0.20 moles of water will be formed from the neutralization reaction.\n\n4.  **Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization:**\n    *   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction between a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -13.7 kcal/mol of water formed. Using a common variant of this value, -13.6 kcal/mol, yields one of the answer choices exactly.\n    *   Enthalpy change = moles of water formed × standard enthalpy of neutralization\n    *   Enthalpy change = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal.\n\n5.  **Consider the precipitation reaction:**\n    *   In this mixture, barium sulfate (BaSO₄), an insoluble salt, will precipitate from the reaction between Ba²⁺ and SO₄²⁻ ions.\n    *   Moles of Ba²⁺ = 0.2 L × 0.5 M = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Moles of SO₄²⁻ = 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol.\n    *   This precipitation reaction also releases heat. However, the question specifically asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization.\" In the context of this multiple-choice question, the calculation that matches an answer perfectly is the one considering only the neutralization aspect.\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of neutralization is -2.72 kcal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
