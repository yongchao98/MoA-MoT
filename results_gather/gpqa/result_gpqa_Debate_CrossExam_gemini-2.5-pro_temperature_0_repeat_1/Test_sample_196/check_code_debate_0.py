    # --- Step 1: Deduce the structure of the starting material (Compound X) ---
    
    # IR Analysis:
    # - The broad peak from 3400–2500 cm-1 is characteristic of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid.
    # - The sharp peak at 1720 cm-1 is characteristic of a C=O stretch in a carboxylic acid.
    # - The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 suggest an aromatic ring.
    # Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.
    
    # NMR Analysis:
    # - 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Confirms the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
    # - 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This pattern (two doublets, 2H each) is classic for a 1,4- (para-) substituted benzene ring.
    # - The remaining signals must describe the alkyl substituent:
    #   - 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A methine (-CH-) proton.
    #   - 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A methylene (-CH2-) group.
    #   - 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl (-CH3) group split into a doublet.
    #   - 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A methyl (-CH3) group split into a triplet.
    #   This combination of signals perfectly describes a sec-butyl group: -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3).
    
    # Combining all data, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

    # --- Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction ---
    
    # The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. This is a powerful reducing agent.
    # Its primary function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3).
    # The reaction is harsh but typically does not reduce the aromatic ring or cause rearrangement of an attached sec-butyl group.
    
    # Reactant: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
    # Transformation: The -COOH group at position 1 is reduced to a -CH3 group.
    # Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene
