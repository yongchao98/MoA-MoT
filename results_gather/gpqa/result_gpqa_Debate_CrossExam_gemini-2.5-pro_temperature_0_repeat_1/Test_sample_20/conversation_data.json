    "**Proposer:** My initial approach is to solve this problem in two parts, as presented in the question. First, I will determine which of the two compounds, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does not exhibit tautomerism. Second, I will identify which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. To do this, I need to examine the molecular structures of these compounds. I will start by searching for information on the tautomerism of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n\n**Skeptic:** This is a reasonable starting point. However, the key to tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom relative to a carbonyl group. A simple structural analysis might be sufficient, but a search is a good way to confirm our understanding and check for any exceptions or special cases. For instance, the stability of the resulting enol form can be a deciding factor. Let's ensure the search is targeted to find out if these specific compounds can or cannot tautomerize.\n\n**Decided Action:** I will execute a search to determine the tautomeric properties of both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.**Proposer:** The initial search has provided information on all four compounds. I will now analyze the results for each part of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Skeptic:** The search results seem comprehensive. Let's proceed with the analysis. For Part A, we need to be certain about which compound lacks the ability to tautomerize. For Part B, we must confirm the presence of a chiral center in one compound and its absence in the other.\n\n**Proposer:**\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** The search results indicate that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. This is because its structure lacks alpha-hydrogens, which are necessary for the most common form of keto-enol tautomerism. Any theoretical tautomer would be highly unstable.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound does exhibit tautomerism. Its enol form, known as phloroglucinol, is an aromatic compound (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This aromaticity provides significant stabilization, making the enol form more stable than the keto form.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Proposer:**\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this compound is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes it a chiral center. Compounds with a chiral center are optically active. Several sources confirm its chirality by referring to its specific enantiomers, (R) and (S) forms. In fact, it is described as the simplest chiral ester.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This compound has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, and is the trans-isomer. It does not contain any chiral centers. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and not optically active.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Skeptic:** The analysis is sound. Compound A is benzoquinone, and Compound B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. This combination matches one of the provided options. The debate is converged.\n\n**Proposer:** Based on the analysis:\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
