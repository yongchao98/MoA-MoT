    "**Proposer**: My plan is to solve this problem by first establishing the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its orbital distance (semi-major axis). Then, I will use the given temperature ratios to determine the ratio of the orbital distances between Planet 3 and Planet 1. Finally, I will apply Kepler's Third Law to convert the ratio of orbital distances into the ratio of orbital periods. The information regarding the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method seems to be extraneous information not required for this calculation. My first action will be to confirm the physical formulas that link these properties.\n\n**Skeptic**: The search results confirm the fundamental relationships. Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (P² ∝ a³). This means the ratio of periods (P₂/P₁) will be equal to the ratio of their semi-major axes (a₂/a₁) raised to the power of 3/2. The concept of planetary equilibrium temperature is also confirmed as a theoretical temperature calculated from the balance between incoming stellar radiation and the energy radiated away by the planet, assuming it's a black body. For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is indeed inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. The problem specifies \"circular orbits,\" which simplifies the orbital distance to the semi-major axis and removes concerns about eccentricity. The provided information about mass and the TTV discovery method still seems extraneous, as the physics of radiative equilibrium and orbital mechanics provide a direct path to the solution.\n\n**Proposer**: I agree. The initial plan is sound and confirmed by the search results. The extraneous information was likely included to test the understanding of the core principles. I will now proceed with the calculation as outlined.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Relate Temperature Ratio to Distance Ratio:**\n    *   The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is proportional to 1 / √a, where 'a' is the orbital distance.\n    *   Therefore, (T_eq_i / T_eq_j) = √(a_j / a_i), which means (a_j / a_i) = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)².\n\n2.  **Calculate Orbital Distance Ratios:**\n    *   Given: T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n    *   a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = 1.4² = 1.96\n    *   Given: T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n    *   a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = 2.3² = 5.29\n\n3.  **Calculate the Overall Distance Ratio (a3 / a1):**\n    *   a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states (P_j / P_i)² = (a_j / a_i)³.\n    *   Therefore, (P_j / P_i) = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2).\n    *   P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   P3 / P1 ≈ 33.38\n    *   This value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
