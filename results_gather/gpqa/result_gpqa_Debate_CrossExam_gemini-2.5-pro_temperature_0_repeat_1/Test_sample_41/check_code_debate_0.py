    # --- Physics Principles ---
    # 1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) vs. Orbital Distance (a):
    # For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).
    # Therefore, (T_i / T_j) = sqrt(a_j / a_i), which implies (a_j / a_i) = (T_i / T_j)^2.

    # 2. Kepler's Third Law:
    # For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).
    # Therefore, (P_j / P_i)^2 = (a_j / a_i)^3, which implies (P_j / P_i) = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2).

    # --- Calculation ---
    # Step 1: Calculate the ratio of orbital distances a2/a1
    # a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2
    a2_a1_ratio = T1_T2_ratio ** 2

    # Step 2: Calculate the ratio of orbital distances a3/a2
    # a3/a2 = (T2/T3)^2
    a3_a2_ratio = T2_T3_ratio ** 2

    # Step 3: Calculate the overall distance ratio a3/a1
    # a3/a1 = (a3/a2) * (a2/a1)
    a3_a1_ratio = a3_a2_ratio * a2_a1_ratio

    # Step 4: Calculate the final period ratio P3/P1 using Kepler's Third Law
    # P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2)
    calculated_period_ratio = a3_a1_ratio ** 1.5

    # --- Verification ---
    # Check if the calculated result is close to the LLM's answer.
    # A relative tolerance of 1% is used to account for rounding in the problem statement ("~", "about", "approximately").
