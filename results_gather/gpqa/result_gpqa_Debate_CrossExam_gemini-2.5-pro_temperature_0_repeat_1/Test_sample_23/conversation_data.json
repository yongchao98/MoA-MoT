    "**Proposer**: The first step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z. The problem states that the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. I can use this information to determine the empirical and likely molecular formula of Z. Z is also described as a saturated hydrocarbon, which means it's either an alkane (CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n\n*   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H is (2n+2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). Setting this to 0.1428 gives (2n+2) / (14n+2) = 0.1428, which does not yield an integer solution for n.\n*   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of H is 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n*   1/7 â‰ˆ 0.142857, which is a match for 14.28%.\n\nTherefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n. The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. This suggests Z is likely a common cycloalkane solvent. I will perform a search to confirm this and identify Z.\n\n**Proposer**: The calculation confirms that Z is a cycloalkane (CnH2n). Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the formula. The core of the problem is the disproportionation reaction. Mixture X (two unsaturated liquids, A and B) is heated with platinum to form mixture Y (two saturated liquids, C and D). This is characteristic of a catalytic hydrogen transfer, specifically the Zelin-Kazansky irreversible catalysis, where an unsaturated cyclic compound disproportionates into an aromatic compound and a cycloalkane.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring, meaning Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   **Mixture X** must contain unsaturated C6 compounds that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. They cannot have conjugated bonds. Possible candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   **The Reaction**: A hydrogen transfer reaction between these two would be:\n    C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene).\n*   **Mixture Y** would therefore be cyclohexane and benzene.\n*   **Skeptic**: Let's check if this hypothesis fits all the conditions.\n    1.  *Is X an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water?* Yes, cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene are liquids and have double bonds. The problem states it's an equimolar mixture.\n    2.  *Is Y an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does NOT decolorize bromine water?* The reaction produces cyclohexane and benzene in a 1:1 molar ratio. Neither cyclohexane (saturated) nor benzene (aromatic) decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits.\n    3.  *Does hydrogenation of X give only Z?* Hydrogenation of cyclohexene (C6H10) gives cyclohexane (C6H12). Hydrogenation of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) also gives cyclohexane (C6H12). So, yes, Z is cyclohexane.\n    4.  *Does hydrogenation of Y give only Z?* Hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane + benzene) under severe conditions (needed for benzene) gives only cyclohexane. This also fits.\n    5.  *Is Z a constituent of Y?* Yes, cyclohexane (Z) is a component of mixture Y.\n    6.  *Is Z a widely used solvent?* Yes, cyclohexane is a common solvent.\n\n**Proposer**: The hypothesis holds up against all the facts. The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in these two liquids.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n**Skeptic**: The logic is sound. The identification of Z as a cycloalkane, the application of the Zelin-Kazansky disproportionation, and the verification against all constraints lead to a consistent solution. No other simple combination of common unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons fits the equimolar and reaction constraints as well as this one. The conclusion is well-supported.\n\n**Decision**: The debate converges. The components of mixture X have been identified, and the total number of hydrogen atoms can be calculated.\n\n<<<D>>>"
