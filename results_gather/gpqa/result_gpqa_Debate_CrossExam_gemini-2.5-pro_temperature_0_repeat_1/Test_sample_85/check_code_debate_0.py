    # Rule 1: LiBH4 reduces esters to alcohols, not carboxylic acids.
    #         This leads to a hydroxy-acid, which can form the target lactone.
    # Rule 2: BH3 reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols, not esters.
    #         This leads to a hydroxy-ester, which CANNOT form the target lactone.
    #         This implies a flaw in the question's premise for reaction B.
    # Rule 3: Stereochemistry is retained because the reaction centers (C1 and C5)
    #         are remote from the stereocenter (C3).

    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction A (LiBH4)
