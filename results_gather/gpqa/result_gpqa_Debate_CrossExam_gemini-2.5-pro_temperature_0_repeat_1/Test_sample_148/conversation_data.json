    "Proposer: The analytical data presents a classic problem in the synthesis of chiral molecules, particularly peptides. We have two sets of signals in the Â¹H NMR for a single proton and two peaks in the LC-MS with identical mass spectra. This immediately suggests the presence of two isomers. Let's break down the possibilities. The fact that the two species are separable by LC (liquid chromatography) and give distinct NMR signals rules out enantiomers (Option A), as they behave identically under achiral conditions. The fact that both species have the same mass, which is consistent with the expected product, rules out contamination with a precursor (Option D) or a side-product from 'double coupling' (Option C), both of which would have different masses. This leaves us with diastereoisomers (Option B). Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and are separable by standard chromatography, and they give distinct NMR spectra. The observations perfectly match the definition of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\nSkeptic: I agree that options A, C, and D are inconsistent with the data. The mass spectrometry data is the most definitive piece of evidence against C and D. The separability by LC and NMR distinction rules out A. So, B is the only remaining option. However, let's consider the specifics. What kind of diastereomers are we likely dealing with in a \"small peptidic compound\"? Two common phenomena could lead to this. First, epimerization (racemization at one of several chiral centers) during the amide bond formation step is a well-known side reaction in peptide synthesis, which would create a pair of diastereomers. Second, peptides can exhibit *cis-trans* isomerism around the amide bonds. These rotational isomers (rotamers) are also a form of diastereomer. The energy barrier to rotation can be high enough that both isomers are observed separately in NMR at room temperature and can even be separated by chromatography. The mention of \"elevated temperature\" in the LC-MS might be a clue; it's often used to either sharpen peaks or, in some cases, resolve slowly interconverting isomers. In either case, whether from epimerization or restricted rotation, the result is a mixture of diastereomers. Therefore, the conclusion remains robust.\n\nProposer: The skeptic's points reinforce the initial conclusion. Both plausible chemical events (epimerization or *cis-trans* isomerism) result in the formation of diastereomers. The provided data (distinct NMR signals, separable by LC, same mass) is the textbook signature for a diastereomeric mixture. There is no need for further investigation as the answer is strongly supported by chemical principles.\n\n<<<B>>>"
