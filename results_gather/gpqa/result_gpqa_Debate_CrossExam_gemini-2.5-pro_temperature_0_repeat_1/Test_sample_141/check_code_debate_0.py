def check_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the given answer for the geometrical position of a density matrix.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Defines the computational basis states |0> and |1> and the Pauli matrices.
    2. Constructs the density matrix rho = 1/2 * (|0><0| + |1><1|).
    3. Calculates the components of the Bloch vector (r_x, r_y, r_z) using the formula r_k = Tr(rho * sigma_k).
    4. Compares the calculated Bloch vector with the vector from the selected answer 'B'.
    5. Returns "Correct" if they match, otherwise returns an error message.
