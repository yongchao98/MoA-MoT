    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the molecular structure and count the bonds.**\n    First, we need to correctly interpret the chemical formula to identify all the covalent bonds within the molecule.\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n          CH3   H         CH3         H         CH3\n           |    |          |          |          |\n    CH3 - C == C - CH2 - CH - CH2 - C == C - CH3\n    ```\n    From this structure, we can count the number of each type of atom and bond:\n    *   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 12\n    *   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 22\n    *   **C-H bonds:** 22\n    *   **C-C single bonds:** 9\n    *   **C=C double bonds:** 2\n\n2.  **Calculate the total energy required for atomization of the elements.**\n    The enthalpy of formation is the energy change when the compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states (C as solid graphite, H as H2 gas). The first step in the Born-Haber cycle for this process is the atomization of these elements into gaseous atoms.\n    *   **Atomization of Carbon:** We need 12 moles of gaseous carbon atoms.\n        *   Energy = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n    *   **Atomization of Hydrogen:** We need 22 moles of gaseous hydrogen atoms, which come from 11 moles of H2 molecules.\n        *   Energy = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol (for H-H bonds) = 1100 kJ\n    *   **Total enthalpy of atomization of elements:** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ\n\n3.  **Calculate the total bond energy of the molecule.**\n    This is the energy released when the gaseous atoms combine to form one mole of the gaseous molecule. It is the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule.\n    *   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n    *   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n    *   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n    *   **Total bond energy of the molecule:** 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = 11200 kJ\n\n4.  **Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°).**\n    The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released upon forming the molecule's bonds.\n    *   ΔHf° = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the molecule)\n    *   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n5.  **Convert the units to match the options.**\n    The calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. The options include values in kJ/g. To convert, we need the molar mass of the molecule (C12H22).\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n    *   **Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g:** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.446 kJ/g\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\n*   A) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy of the molecule)\n*   B) 67.4 kJ/mol\n*   C) 11.44 kJ/g\n*   D) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value of approximately 11.44 kJ/g matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
