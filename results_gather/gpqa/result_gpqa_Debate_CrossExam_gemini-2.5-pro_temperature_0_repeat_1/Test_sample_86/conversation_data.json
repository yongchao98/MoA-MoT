    "**Proposer:**\nBased on the information provided, the compound in question is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, contains a total of 8 carbon atoms, and has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond according to its FTIR spectrum.\n\nLet's break down the molecular structure:\n1.  A 6-membered aromatic ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6).\n2.  The remaining 2 carbon atoms must be in the two substituents.\n3.  One substituent contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n4.  The other substituent is a halogen (-X) directly bonded to the aromatic ring (an \"aromatic-halogen bond\").\n\nThe most logical structure that accommodates these facts is **halo-acetyl-benzene**. The acetyl group (-COCH3) provides the carbonyl function and the necessary two additional carbon atoms. The halogen is the second substituent on the benzene ring. This structure (X-C6H4-COCH3) has 8 carbons, is di-substituted, contains a carbonyl group, and has an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\nNow, let's analyze the provided ¹H NMR options based on this structure. We need to consider the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n*   **Option C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic indicator of a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n    *   The singlet at 2.3 ppm, integrating to 3 protons, is characteristic of the methyl protons of an **acetyl group** (-COCH3) attached to an aromatic system.\n    *   Both the acetyl group and the halogen are electron-withdrawing, which deshields the aromatic protons, shifting them downfield to the observed 7.6-7.8 ppm range. The protons ortho to the more strongly withdrawing acetyl group are expected to be further downfield, consistent with the two distinct doublets.\n\nThis data perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a **para-halo-acetophenone**, such as 4'-chloroacetophenone or 4'-bromoacetophenone.\n\nMy proposed action is to confirm this analysis and rule out the other options.\n\n**Skeptic:**\nYour analysis of option C is convincing. However, to be thorough, let's explicitly discredit the other options based on the initial constraints and the search results.\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm). A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 protons, and their signals are clearly absent. Therefore, this cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **Option B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The two doublets in the aromatic region suggest a para-substituted ring. A possible structure would be p-(formyl)-C6H4-(CH2X), where X is a halogen. This structure has 8 carbons (C6 ring + C1 aldehyde + C1 methylene) and a carbonyl group. However, the halogen is on the methylene group, not the aromatic ring. This violates the \"aromatic-halogen bond\" condition specified in the prompt.\n\n*   **Option D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is inconsistent for several reasons. A singlet for 1H in the aromatic region would imply a tetra-substituted ring, not di-substituted. The integration of the upfield singlet (2H) is unusual for a methyl or similar group. Like option A, it does not show the expected pattern for a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n\nThe only plausible structure is a halo-acetyl-benzene. The ortho and meta isomers would produce more complex splitting patterns in the aromatic region with four distinct signals, not the two clean doublets seen in option C. Therefore, the compound must be a para-halo-acetophenone.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe debate has converged. The initial analysis is confirmed, and all other options have been systematically ruled out. The compound is a para-halo-acetophenone, and the NMR data in option C is the only correct match.\n\n<<<C>>>"
