**Proposer:** The user is asking to compare the total energy spectrum of the emitted 'E' particles in two different nuclear decays.

1.  **Standard Decay:** 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V
2.  **Exotic Decay:** 2A -> 2B + 2E + M (where M is a single, massless particle)

This scenario is a direct analogy to two forms of double-beta decay studied in nuclear and particle physics:
*   The standard decay is analogous to **two-neutrino double beta decay (2νββ)**.
*   The exotic decay is analogous to **Majoron-emitting neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββM)**.

In any particle decay, the available energy (the Q-value) is distributed among the final products. If there are three or more particles in the final state, this energy is shared in a continuous distribution.

*   In the standard decay, the final state has the nucleus B, two E particles, and two V particles. Since there are multiple light particles (2E, 2V) sharing the energy, the sum energy spectrum of the two E particles is continuous.
*   In the exotic decay, the final state has the nucleus B, two E particles, and one M particle. Again, there are multiple light particles (2E, M) sharing the energy, so the sum energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous.

This eliminates options A and C, which claim the spectrum becomes discrete. The choice is now between B and D, which depends on how the endpoint of the spectrum changes. The key is to understand how the shape of the energy distribution is altered. I will perform a search to find and compare the spectral shapes of two-neutrino double beta decay and Majoron-emitting double beta decay.

**Skeptic:** The Proposer's reasoning that the spectrum remains continuous is sound. The core of the issue is the comparison of the spectral shape and endpoint. The endpoint of the spectrum is the maximum possible sum kinetic energy of the two E particles, which corresponds to the Q-value of the decay. The Q-value is determined by the mass difference between the initial (A) and final (B) nuclei and should be identical for both decay modes. Therefore, the true endpoint should not change. However, options B and D explicitly state that the endpoint increases or decreases. This suggests either a misunderstanding of the term "endpoint" in the question's context or a more subtle physical principle. The distribution of energy (the spectral shape) will certainly be different because the phase space of a three-light-particle final state (2E, M) is different from a four-light-particle final state (2E, 2V). A search comparing the spectral shapes is the correct next step. We should look for plots of these spectra to see how the distribution shifts. It's possible the question uses "endpoint" colloquially to refer to the peak of the distribution.

**Decision:** The next action is to search for the sum electron energy spectra for both two-neutrino double beta decay and Majoron-emitting neutrinoless double beta decay to compare their shapes and peaks.

**Proposer:** The search results provide plots and descriptions of the sum electron energy spectra for both two-neutrino double beta decay (2νββ), our "original decay," and Majoron-emitting neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββM), our "exotic decay."

1.  **Continuity:** The results confirm that both decay modes produce a continuous energy spectrum for the sum of the electron energies. This is because in both scenarios, the total decay energy (Q-value) is shared among more than two final-state particles. This definitively rules out options A and C.

2.  **Spectral Shape and "Endpoint":** The search results show that the shapes of the spectra are different. Specifically, plots comparing the spectra show that the 2νββ decay mode has a broad distribution that peaks at a relatively low energy (roughly one-third of the total Q-value). In contrast, the spectrum for the Majoron-emitting decay is "harder," meaning it is skewed towards higher energies, and its peak occurs at a significantly higher energy than the peak of the 2νββ spectrum.

The physical endpoint, which is the maximum possible energy the electrons can have (the Q-value), is the same for both decays because it is determined by the initial and final nuclei (A and B). However, the options provided in the question suggest the endpoint *changes*. This indicates that the question is likely using the term "endpoint" in a less strict sense to refer to the most prominent feature of the spectrum, which is its peak (the most probable energy).

Under this interpretation:
*   The spectrum remains continuous.
*   The shape is adjusted (skewed towards higher energy).
*   The peak of the spectrum increases.

This aligns perfectly with option B.

**Skeptic:** The Proposer's analysis is correct. The physics dictates that the spectrum remains continuous and the true endpoint (Q-value) is unchanged. The search results clearly show that the spectral shape for the Majoron-emitting decay is shifted to the right, meaning the peak of the distribution is at a higher energy compared to the standard two-neutrino decay. The only way to reconcile the evidence with the provided multiple-choice answers is to assume "endpoint" refers to this peak. This is a common ambiguity in less formal physics questions. Therefore, the conclusion that the spectrum remains continuous and the "endpoint" (peak) increases is the only logical choice.

**Conclusion:** The debate converges. Both roles agree on the interpretation of the physics and the likely meaning of the question's wording.
