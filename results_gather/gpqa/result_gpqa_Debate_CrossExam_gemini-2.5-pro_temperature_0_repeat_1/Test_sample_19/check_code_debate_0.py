def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer regarding the impulse approximation.

    The impulse approximation in nuclear physics is based on three main ideas:
    1. The interaction involves only one nucleon at a time (one-body current).
    2. The interaction is so fast that the nucleon's binding potential can be ignored during the event.
    3. The incoming probe and outgoing particles do not interact with the rest of the nucleus (transparency, no final-state interactions).

    This function maps these principles to the given options and verifies the LLM's choice.
