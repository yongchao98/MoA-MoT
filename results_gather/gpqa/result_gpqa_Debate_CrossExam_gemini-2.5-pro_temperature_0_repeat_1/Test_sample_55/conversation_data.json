    "**Proposer:** The problem requires us to identify the correct decay path and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state through a two-step dipole process.\n\n1.  **First Transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>**\n    *   The electric dipole transition selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.\n    *   Starting from |3,0,0> (l=0, m=0), the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n    *   The options suggest the intermediate principal quantum number is n'=2. Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n2.  **Second Transition: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\n    *   From any of the |2,1,m'> states, a transition to |1,0,0> is possible.\n    *   For l=1 to l=0, Δl = -1 (allowed).\n    *   For m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1} to m=0, Δm is ∈ {1, 0, -1} (allowed).\n    *   Since spontaneous emission requires the principal quantum number to decrease, the transition from n=2 to n=1 is the only possible decay path from the |2,1,m'> states. Therefore, the probability of this second step, P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>), is 1 for any of the allowed intermediate states.\n\n3.  **Probability Calculation:**\n    *   The probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element |<n',l',m'| **r** |n,l,m>|².\n    *   According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, for a transition from a state with l=0, the transition probabilities to the different m' sublevels of the final state are equal.\n    *   This means the probabilities for the transitions |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>, |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>, and |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> are identical.\n    *   Since these are the only three possible intermediate states in the n=2, l=1 manifold, they must share the total probability equally. The branching ratio for each is 1/3.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of the specific route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> is the product of the probabilities of each step: P(route) = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n**Skeptic:** The reasoning seems sound, but the existence of option B with a probability of 2/3 for the same path is concerning. It suggests there might be a nuance missed. For transitions between states with l ≠ 0, the probabilities for different Δm transitions are not always equal and can depend on factors like polarization. However, for a transition *from* an l=0 state, the spherical symmetry should guarantee equal probabilities for each final m' state, assuming no external fields and that we are averaging over all emission directions. The calculation of 1/3 seems robust. The 2/3 value might arise from a misunderstanding of the question or a non-standard context. A search to confirm the branching ratios for the 3s → 2p transition in hydrogen is a prudent step to verify the theoretical conclusion.\n\n**Decision:** The theoretical argument strongly supports a 1/3 probability for each of the three possible decay paths. I will proceed with a search to confirm this and rule out any alternative interpretations that could lead to a 2/3 probability.\n\n**Proposer:** My initial analysis concluded that the decay of the |3,0,0> state proceeds with equal probability through the three intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. This is based on the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which states that for a transition from a spherically symmetric state (l=0), the transition probabilities to the different magnetic sublevels (m') of a given l' state are identical. The subsequent decay from any |2,1,m'> state to the |1,0,0> ground state has a probability of 1, as it is the only allowed decay channel. Therefore, the probability for any specific route, such as |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, is the branching ratio of the first step, which is 1/3.\n\n**Skeptic:** The theoretical argument is sound, but it's crucial to confirm it, especially since an option with a 2/3 probability exists. The search results should be examined for any information that contradicts this 1/3 probability conclusion.\n\n**Analysis of Search Results:**\n*   The search results confirm the standard dipole selection rules: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.\n*   They also confirm that for a transition to occur, the matrix element of the dipole operator between the initial and final states must be non-zero.\n*   One source directly addresses the question of symmetry for this exact problem. It confirms that the probability for the electron to take each of the three routes (|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0>, |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, and |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0>) is 1/3. It explicitly states that this is because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which determine the angular part of the transition probability, are the same for all three |3,0,0>→|2,1,m'> transitions.\n*   Another source, while discussing the 2P→1S transition, notes that the transition rate is independent of the magnetic quantum number m, which is a general result. This supports the conclusion that the decay rates from |3,0,0> to each of the |2,1,m'> states are equal.\n\n**Conclusion:** The initial theoretical analysis is strongly supported by the search results, particularly by a source that directly analyzes the same problem. The probability of the cascade proceeding through any single |2,1,m'> state is 1/3. The path specified in options B and D is |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, and its calculated probability is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
