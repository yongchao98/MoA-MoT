    "Proposer: My hypothesis is that compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, while 3 and 4 do not.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The presence of bulky groups (nitro and dicarboxylate) at all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') should severely restrict rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can lead to non-superimposable mirror images, which are optically active.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center, which is a common cause of optical isomerism.\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. This molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and therefore not optically active.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer should be C. I will perform a search to verify the chirality of these compounds.\n\nSkeptic: The reasoning seems solid, especially for compounds 2, 3, and 4. The identification of the chiral center in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is straightforward. The arguments based on the plane of symmetry for benzophenone and the center of inversion for dimethyl fumarate are also strong indicators of achirality. The main point to confirm is for compound 1. While ortho-substituted biphenyls are classic examples of atropisomerism, it's crucial to be certain that these specific substituents (nitro and dicarboxylate) are bulky enough to create stable, resolvable enantiomers at room temperature. A search should confirm the existence of atropisomerism in this class of compounds.\n\nDecide: I will execute a search to confirm the optical activity of each of the four compounds, paying special attention to the atropisomerism in dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.Proposer: The search results confirm my initial analysis.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: The search results show that substituted biphenyls with bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') exhibit atropisomerism and are optically active. Specifically, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid is a classic example of a resolvable, optically active biphenyl. The compound in question has nitro groups at 6,6' and dicarboxylate groups at 2,2', which are all bulky. This confirms it will show optical isomerism.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The search results explicitly state that this compound, also known as methyl lactate, is the \"simplest chiral ester\". It exists as separate (R) and (S) enantiomers. This confirms it is optically active.\n3.  **benzophenone**: While individual molecules of benzophenone are achiral, they can crystallize into enantiomorphic solids that show optical activity. However, in solution or as an individual molecule, it is achiral due to symmetry and does not exhibit optical isomerism. The question refers to the properties of the compound itself, not its crystalline form.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of a butenedioate. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion, making it achiral. It is a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate, but it is not optically active.\n\nTherefore, compounds 1 and 2 are the ones that show optical isomerism.\n\nSkeptic: The evidence is compelling. The searches confirm the initial reasoning for all four compounds. The point about benzophenone crystallizing into chiral forms is interesting but irrelevant to the inherent chirality of the molecule itself, which is the focus of the question. The atropisomerism of compound 1 and the chiral center of compound 2 are well-supported. The achiral nature of compounds 3 and 4 is also clearly confirmed. The debate can be concluded.\n\n<<<C>>>"
