    "**Proposer:** The problem requires us to calculate the kinetic energy of a fission fragment using both relativistic and classical physics and then find the difference. My proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  First, determine the rest masses of the two fragments using the given ratios. The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. The final total rest mass is 99% of the initial, and one fragment is twice as massive as the other.\n2.  Calculate the total kinetic energy released in the fission, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies (the Q-value).\n3.  Using conservation of momentum and the relativistic energy-momentum relation, set up an equation to solve for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1).\n4.  Repeat the calculation for T1 using the classical relationship between kinetic energy, momentum, and mass.\n5.  Finally, calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 and convert it to MeV.\n\nThis is a calculation-based problem, so no external search is needed.\n\n**Skeptic:** The proposed path is logical. However, I must raise a few points to ensure accuracy:\n1.  **Algebraic Precision:** The relativistic calculation involves solving a quadratic equation. A simple sign error or mistake in expansion could lead to an incorrect result. The algebraic steps must be double-checked.\n2.  **Formula Integrity:** The core of the relativistic calculation is the relation `(pc)^2 = T(T + 2mc^2)`. Is this formula correct? Yes, it derives directly from `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2` and `E = T + mc^2`.\n3.  **Conservation Laws:** The application of conservation of energy (to find the total kinetic energy) and conservation of momentum (to relate the two fragments' energies) is fundamental. The assumption that momenta are equal and opposite (`|p1| = |p2|`) is correct for a decay from rest.\n4.  **Unit Conversion:** The initial data is in GeV, but the final answer options are in MeV. A final conversion step (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`) is required and must not be forgotten.\n\n**Decision:** The proposer's plan is sound, and the skeptic's concerns are valid checks on the execution rather than flaws in the plan itself. The next and only action is to perform the detailed calculation.\n\n***\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Determine Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Let the rest-mass energies of the fragments be `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2*m2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting `m1 = 2*m2`: `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` => `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   The more massive fragment has a rest-mass energy of 198 GeV.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    *   The energy released is the loss in rest mass: `Q = T1 + T2 = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_rel):**\n    *   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`.\n    *   Using the relativistic relation `(pc)^2 = T(T + 2mc^2)`:\n        `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`\n    *   Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198`, and `m2*c^2 = 99` (all in GeV):\n        `T1 * (T1 + 2*198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2*99)`\n        `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n        `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n        `600*T1 = 603`\n        `T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_class):**\n    *   In classical mechanics, `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   Since `p1 = p2`, the ratio of kinetic energies is `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1`.\n    *   `T1 / T2 = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`, which means `T2 = 2*T1`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV` => `3*T1 = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_class = 1 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   Difference = `T1_rel - T1_class = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Convert to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
