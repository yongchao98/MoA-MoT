    "Answering the user's question.\n### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a stereocenter at the C5 position. It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position. Since the starting material is chiral and the reducing agent is achiral, the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face, resulting in the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter in common (C5) and one that is different (C3).\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** A mixture of two diastereomers.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups to alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the carbonyls at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. The possible stereoisomers are:\n1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nThe (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces all possible stereoisomers, so the product is a mixture of the racemic pair and the meso compound.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** A mixture of three stereoisomers (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined, resulting in a total of five different stereoisomers to be analyzed.\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. The stationary phase is achiral (e.g., silica).\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute together as a single peak.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will have different polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n2.  From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **one peak**.\n3.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity, eluting as a separate, **second peak** from the Reaction II products.\n4.  The products of Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally very different and will have distinct polarities, ensuring they do not accidentally elute at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n2.  The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will be resolved by the chiral column into **two separate peaks**.\n3.  The meso compound from Reaction II is achiral and will produce a single, distinct **one peak**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
