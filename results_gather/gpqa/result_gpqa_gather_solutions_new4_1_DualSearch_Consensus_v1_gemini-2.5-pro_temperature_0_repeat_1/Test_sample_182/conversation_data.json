This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   **Alcohols (-OH)** are also reduced to alkanes.\n\nApplying this to the starting material:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group at position 1 is reduced to a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group at position 2 is reduced to a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group at position 5 is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is **1-ethyl-2,4-dimethylcyclohexane** (based on IUPAC naming of the product, though the specific isomerism isn't critical for the formula). Let's re-evaluate the product name based on the starting material's numbering: the product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the product.\n\nThe product is a saturated cycloalkane with substituents.\n*   The cyclohexane ring has 6 carbon atoms.\n*   Two methyl groups (-CH₃) add 2 carbon atoms.\n*   One ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) adds 2 carbon atoms.\n*   Total carbons = 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 (C₁₀).\n\nThe general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ.\nFor our product with 10 carbon atoms, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\nUsing the IHD formula for the product (C₁₀H₂₀):\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThis IHD of 1 is accounted for by the single ring structure of the cyclohexane. Since all double bonds and oxygen-containing functional groups have been reduced, the only remaining feature contributing to hydrogen deficiency compared to an acyclic alkane (C₁₀H₂₂) is the ring itself.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI) is a strong reduction reaction. This specific combination of reagents is known to reduce multiple types of functional groups down to simple alkanes.\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material and its Functional Groups:**\n    The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    Its structure contains:\n    *   A cyclohexene ring (a ring with one carbon-carbon double bond).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   A formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO).\n    *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH2), which contains another carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n2.  **Determine the Effect of the Reagents:**\n    Red phosphorus and excess HI are powerful reducing agents capable of the following transformations:\n    *   Reduction of carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Reduction of aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Reduction of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   Reduction of alcohols to alkanes.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    The reaction will reduce all the functional groups present in the starting molecule to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon forms, without breaking the carbon skeleton.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group is reduced to a methyl group.\n    *   The aldehyde group is reduced to a methyl group.\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, making it a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    The original carbon skeleton consists of a six-membered ring, a one-carbon substituent from the carboxylic acid, a one-carbon substituent from the aldehyde, and a two-carbon substituent from the vinyl group. The total number of carbon atoms is 10. The final product is a fully saturated, substituted cycloalkane containing 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (cycloalkane) is CnH2n. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It is calculated using the formula:\n    IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\n    For the product with the molecular formula C10H20:\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    IHD = 11 - 10\n    IHD = 1\n\n    This IHD value of 1 corresponds to the presence of the single ring in the cyclohexane structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1. Identify the Starting Material and its Structure**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By convention, this is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is at position 5.\n\nThe structure contains the following features that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency:\n*   One ring\n*   One C=C double bond within the ring\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl (aldehyde) group\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group\n\nThe IHD of the starting material is the sum of rings and pi bonds: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=O in acid) = **5**.\n\n**2. Identify the Reagent and the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This is a very strong reducing agent known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds. Specifically:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkane groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It does not break the carbon ring structure.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, forming a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced, converting it to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted **cyclohexane**. It is a saturated molecule, meaning it contains only single bonds, but it still has a ring structure.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\nFor the product:\n*   **Number of rings**: The cyclohexane ring is preserved. So, there is **1** ring.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All double bonds (C=C and C=O) have been reduced to single bonds. So, there are **0** π bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula.\n*   Starting material (C₁₀H₁₂O₃) has 10 carbon atoms. The reduction does not change the number of carbons.\n*   The product is a substituted cycloalkane with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   For n=10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n*   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1, which corresponds to the single ring in the saturated structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the starting material.**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\nLet's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **formyl**: This is a -CHO group (an aldehyde), which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **vinyl**: This is a -CH=CH2 group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\nLet's count them for the starting material:\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n*   Number of π bonds:\n    *   1 from the C=C in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   1 from the C=C in the vinyl group.\n    *   1 from the C=O in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   1 from the C=O in the formyl group.\n    *   Total π bonds = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n\nSo, the IHD of the starting material is:\nIHD (start) = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and the reagent.**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**.\nThis combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its key functions are:\n*   It reduces all carbon-oxygen double bonds (in aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids) completely to alkanes. The oxygen atoms are removed.\n    *   -CHO (formyl group) is reduced to -CH3 (methyl group).\n    *   -COOH (carboxylic acid group) is reduced to -CH3 (methyl group).\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds to single bonds (C-C) by adding hydrogen across them.\n*   It does not break stable ring structures like cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product and its IHD.**\nThe reaction will cause the following changes to the starting material:\n*   The C=C bond within the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=O bond in the formyl group will be reduced (and the oxygen removed).\n*   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group will be reduced (and both oxygens removed).\n\nEssentially, all the π bonds in the molecule are eliminated by the reduction. The only feature contributing to the IHD that remains is the ring structure itself, as the cyclohexane ring is not opened by this reagent.\n\nTherefore, the final product is a saturated substituted cyclohexane. It has one ring and zero π bonds.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the IHD of the final product.**\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings in product) + (Number of π bonds in product)\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring remains)\n*   Number of π bonds = 0 (all C=C and C=O bonds are reduced)\n\nIHD (product) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe final product is a substituted alkane with a single ring, so its index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Starting Material: C10H12O3. IHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5. Correct.\n*   Product: All functional groups and double bonds are reduced. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane. Its molecular formula is C10H20.\n*   IHD of Product: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1. The calculation confirms the result.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant and its Structure:**\n    The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to identify its key features:\n    *   **`cyclohex-3-ene`**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). A ring structure itself counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **`carboxylic acid` (-COOH)**: This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   **`formyl` (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   **`vinyl` (-CH=CH₂)**: This group contains another carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n2.  **Understand the Reagent and Reaction:**\n    The reagent used is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effect is to reduce almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It does not break open stable cycloalkane rings.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    We apply the reducing action of Red P + HI to each part of the starting molecule:\n    *   The C=C bond in the `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the ring to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The C=C bond in the `vinyl` group is reduced, converting it to an `ethyl` group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n\n    The final product is a fully saturated molecule containing a cyclohexane ring with various alkyl substituents. All the original double bonds (both C=C and C=O) have been removed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Rings:** The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings is 1.\n    *   **Pi Bonds:** The reaction with Red P + HI reduces all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the product has zero pi bonds.\n\n    IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n    IHD of the product = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product. The carbon skeleton is preserved.\n    *   Carbons in reactant: 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n    *   The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane) with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for such a compound is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   So, the product's formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n    *   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe code execution from the previous step confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1.

(Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n    Alternatively, we can count the rings and pi bonds in the structure:\n    *   1 ring = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=C bond in the ring = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=O bond in the carboxylic acid = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=O bond in the formyl group = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=C bond in the vinyl group = 1 IHD\n    *   Total IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This is a very strong reduction reaction.

It has 2 hydrogens.\n*   Total hydrogens = 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 3 (vinyl) + 1 (C1) + 1 (C2) + 1 (C3) + 1 (C4) + 1 (C5) + 2 (C6) = **12 hydrogen atoms**.\n\nThe molecule also contains 2 oxygen atoms from the carboxylic acid and 1 from the formyl group, for a total of **3 oxygen atoms**.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the starting material can be calculated using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2). Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\nIHD_start = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis can be verified by its structure: 1 ring + 1 C=C in the ring + 1 C=C in the vinyl group + 1 C=O in the formyl group + 1 C=O in the carboxylic acid group = 5.\n\n### 2. The Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI\n\nThe reaction with red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI) is a very strong reduction reaction. This reagent is capable of reducing several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Ketones are reduced to methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\nIn this reaction, all oxygen-containing functional groups and all carbon-carbon double bonds will be reduced.\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule remains intact. The starting material has 10 carbon atoms, so the product will also have 10 carbon atoms. The reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group at position 2 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ.\n\nAs the product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula will be **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe IHD of the final product can be calculated from its molecular formula, C₁₀H₂₀.\nIHD_product = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD_product = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD_product = 11 - 10 = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 for a hydrocarbon indicates the presence of either one ring or one double bond. Since the reaction saturates all double bonds but preserves the ring structure, the IHD of 1 corresponds to the cyclohexane ring in the product molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula.\n\n*   **Carbon Skeleton:** It has a six-membered cyclohexene ring.\n*   **Functional Groups:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1.\n    *   A formyl group (-CHO) at position 2.\n    *   A double bond within the ring between carbons 3 and 4.\n    *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n\n**Drawing the structure and counting the atoms:**\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** We can deduce the number of hydrogens by ensuring each carbon has four bonds.\n    *   Ring hydrogens: 7\n    *   -COOH hydrogen: 1\n    *   -CHO hydrogen: 1\n    *   -CH=CH₂ hydrogens: 3\n    *   Total hydrogens = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent.\n\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\nEssentially, all oxygen-containing functional groups and sites of unsaturation (double/triple bonds) are completely reduced to a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will convert the starting material into a saturated hydrocarbon while preserving the original carbon skeleton.\n\n*   The C₁₀ carbon skeleton will remain.\n*   The carboxylic acid group, formyl group, and both vinyl and ring double bonds will be fully reduced.\n*   All oxygen atoms will be removed.\n*   The initial ring structure will remain, but it will become a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe product will be a C₁₀ saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is **CₙH₂ₙ**. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms.\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 indicates the presence of either one ring or one double bond.

Let's determine its molecular formula:\n*   The base structure is a cyclohex-3-ene ring.\n*   At position 1, there is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   At position 2, there is a formyl group (-CHO).\n*   At position 5, there is a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in the carboxyl group + 1 in the formyl group + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** We start with a cyclohexene ring (C₆H₁₀) and substitute at positions 1, 2, and 5. This gives a C₆H₇ core. Adding the hydrogens from the substituents: 7 (core) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 3 (in -CH=CH₂) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in the carboxyl group + 1 in the formyl group = 3 oxygens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using the formula: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For C₁₀H₁₂O₃, the IHD is:\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\nTherefore, all the sites of unsaturation and all oxygen-containing functional groups in the starting material will be completely reduced.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product\n\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring will be reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 will be reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at position 2 will be reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 will be reduced to an ethyl group.\n\nThe final product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the IHD of the Product\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of the product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the cyclohexane ring + 1 in the first methyl group + 1 in the second methyl group + 2 in the ethyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** A cyclohexane ring has the formula C₆H₁₂. We replace three hydrogen atoms with the substituent groups, leaving C₆H₉. Adding the hydrogens from the substituents: 9 (ring) + 3 (first methyl) + 3 (second methyl) + 5 (ethyl) = 20 hydrogens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nNow, we calculate the IHD for the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, the IHD represents the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, is a saturated cycloalkane. It contains one ring and no double or triple bonds.

This powerful reducing agent converts all functional groups (carboxylic acid, aldehyde) and unsaturations (C=C double bonds) into a saturated hydrocarbon while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n\nThe initial molecule has 10 carbon atoms. The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane) with the molecular formula C10H20.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency was calculated using the formula IHD = C + 1 - (H/2):\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nAn IHD of 1 indicates the presence of one ring, which is consistent with the final product being a substituted cyclohexane.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first identify the starting material and the product formed after the reaction.\n\n**1. Starting Material and its Molecular Formula**\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene ring**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1.\n    *   A formyl group (-CHO) at position 2.\n    *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n\nCounting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CHO group + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 7 on the ring structure + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 3 in the vinyl group = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**2. Reaction and Product**\n\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces various functional groups to their corresponding alkanes:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\nApplying this to the starting material:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid at position 1 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at position 2 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is **4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n**3. Molecular Formula of the Product**\n\nNow, let's determine the molecular formula for 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 in the cyclohexane ring + 2 from the two methyl groups + 2 from the ethyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: A saturated cyclohexane ring has the formula CₙH₂ₙ, which for C₁₀ would be C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for calculating IHD is:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms. Oxygen and halogen atoms do not affect the basic calculation.\n\nFor the product with the formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of one ring (the cyclohexane ring) in the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer**: My goal is to determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the final product. To do this, I first need to identify the starting material's structure and molecular formula. Then, I must understand the reaction that occurs when \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\" is treated with red phosphorus and excess HI. This reagent is a strong reducing agent, and I need to determine which of the functional groups (aldehyde, carboxylic acid, and the two C=C double bonds) it will reduce. Once the product's structure is determined, I can find its molecular formula and calculate the IHD. My first action will be to search for the reactivity of these specific functional groups with red phosphorus and HI.\n\n**Skeptic**: This approach is sound, but the critical point is the scope of the reduction by red phosphorus and HI. While it's well-known for reducing oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to alkanes, its effect on carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) is less common knowledge and must be verified. If the double bonds are also reduced, the IHD will be significantly lower than if they are not. A simple search might not be enough; we need to be certain about the reaction's outcome on all parts of the molecule.\n\n**Decide**: The immediate and most crucial step is to confirm the extent of the reduction caused by red phosphorus and excess HI, specifically whether it affects carbon-carbon double bonds in addition to the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups.\n\n**Proposer**: The search results confirm that red phosphorus with excess HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is capable of reducing carboxylic acids and aldehydes completely to their corresponding alkanes. Some sources also indicate that it can reduce alkenes (C=C double bonds) and alkynes. Therefore, my hypothesis is that all functional groups in the starting material will be reduced to a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\n**Skeptic**: While the evidence is strong for the reduction of the oxygen-containing functional groups, the reduction of alkenes by this method is less consistently documented and can sometimes be substrate-dependent. However, given the \"excess HI\" condition and the general description of this reagent as one of the strongest, it is reasonable to assume the reduction of the double bonds as well. Let's proceed with this assumption, but it's the most likely point of error if the answer is incorrect.\n\n**Decide**: We will proceed by determining the product under the assumption that the reagent reduces the aldehyde, the carboxylic acid, and both carbon-carbon double bonds. We will then calculate the IHD of this final, fully saturated product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   Let's determine its molecular formula.\n        *   The core structure is a cyclohexene ring: C6.\n        *   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH): C1, O2, H1.\n        *   It has a formyl group (-CHO): C1, O1, H1.\n        *   It has a vinyl group (-CH=CH2): C2, H3.\n        *   Let's assemble the full carbon skeleton: A 6-membered ring with a 1-carbon chain (from COOH), another 1-carbon chain (from CHO), and a 2-carbon chain (from the vinyl group). This gives a total of 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 carbon atoms.\n    *   The final product will be a saturated hydrocarbon derivative of this C10 skeleton.\n\n2.  **Reaction**: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and excess HI.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The aldehyde group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n    *   The double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond, converting the vinyl group to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Product Structure**:\n    *   The starting `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `2-formyl` group becomes a `2-methyl` group.\n    *   The `5-vinyl` group becomes a `5-ethyl` group.\n    *   The `1-carboxylic acid` group becomes a `1-methyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n4.  **Molecular Formula of the Product**:\n    *   The product is a saturated cycloalkane with alkyl substituents. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n    *   Our product has a C10 skeleton (C6 ring + C1 methyl + C1 methyl + C2 ethyl = C10).\n    *   Since it is a single-ring alkane, its formula should be CnH2n.\n    *   For C10, the formula is C10H20.\n\n5.  **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation**:\n    *   The IHD formula is: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   For the product C10H20:\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 0/2 + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   IHD = 1\n\n    Alternatively, the IHD represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n*   Starting material correctly identified.\n*   Reaction's effect on all functional groups determined based on search results.\n*   Product structure correctly predicted based on the reaction.\n*   Molecular formula of the product (C10H20) is correct for a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   IHD calculation is correct based on both the formula and the structure (one ring).\n\nThe debate converges.

    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must follow a systematic approach by analyzing the starting material, the reaction it undergoes, and the resulting product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation (rings and pi bonds).\n*   **`cyclohex-3-ene`**: This indicates a six-membered ring (which counts as one degree of unsaturation) containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C, a second degree of unsaturation).\n*   **`-carboxylic acid`**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O, a third degree of unsaturation).\n*   **`2-formyl`**: This is an aldehyde group (-CHO), which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O, a fourth degree of unsaturation).\n*   **`5-vinyl`**: This is a -CH=CH₂ group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C, a fifth degree of unsaturation).\n\nSumming these up, the starting material has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = 5.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is known in organic chemistry as one of the most powerful reducing agents. Its function is to completely reduce various functional groups to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It does not break open stable cycloalkane rings.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations on the starting molecule:\n*   The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, forming a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   The C=O double bond in the formyl group is reduced, converting the group to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced, converting the group to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated molecule. It consists of a cyclohexane ring with alkyl substituents. All the original pi bonds (both C=C and C=O) have been eliminated.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings is **1**.\n*   **Number of pi bonds**: The powerful reduction has eliminated all double bonds. So, the number of pi bonds is **0**.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nThis result can be confirmed by determining the molecular formula. The starting material has 10 carbon atoms, and this number is conserved. The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane, which has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.

This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   **Alcohols (-OH)** are also reduced to alkanes.\n\nApplying this to the starting material:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group at position 1 is reduced to a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group at position 2 is reduced to a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group at position 5 is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is **1-ethyl-2,4-dimethylcyclohexane** (based on IUPAC naming of the product, though the specific isomerism isn't critical for the formula).

So, there is **1** ring.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All double bonds (C=C and C=O) have been reduced to single bonds. So, there are **0** π bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula.\n*   Starting material (C₁₀H₁₂O₃) has 10 carbon atoms.

The only feature contributing to the IHD that remains is the ring structure itself, as the cyclohexane ring is not opened by this reagent.\n\nTherefore, the final product is a saturated substituted cyclohexane.

It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C4 is part of the ring's double bond and is bonded to C3 and C5. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C5 has the vinyl group and is bonded to C4 and C6. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C6 is bonded to C1 and C5. It has 2 hydrogens.\n*   Total hydrogens = 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 3 (vinyl) + 1 (C1) + 1 (C2) + 1 (C3) + 1 (C4) + 1 (C5) + 2 (C6) = **12 hydrogen atoms**.\n\nThe molecule also contains 2 oxygen atoms from the carboxylic acid and 1 from the formyl group, for a total of **3 oxygen atoms**.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the starting material can be calculated using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2). Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\nIHD_start = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis can be verified by its structure: 1 ring + 1 C=C in the ring + 1 C=C in the vinyl group + 1 C=O in the formyl group + 1 C=O in the carboxylic acid group = 5.\n\n### 2. The Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI\n\nThe reaction with red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI) is a very strong reduction reaction. This reagent is capable of reducing several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Ketones are reduced to methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\nIn this reaction, all oxygen-containing functional groups and all carbon-carbon double bonds will be reduced.\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule remains intact. The starting material has 10 carbon atoms, so the product will also have 10 carbon atoms. The reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group at position 2 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ.\n\nAs the product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula will be **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe IHD of the final product can be calculated from its molecular formula, C₁₀H₂₀.\nIHD_product = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD_product = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD_product = 11 - 10 = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 for a hydrocarbon indicates the presence of either one ring or one double bond. Since the reaction saturates all double bonds but preserves the ring structure, the IHD of 1 corresponds to the cyclohexane ring in the product molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula.\n\n*   **Carbon Skeleton:** It has a six-membered cyclohexene ring.\n*   **Functional Groups:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1.\n    *   A formyl group (-CHO) at position 2.\n    *   A double bond within the ring between carbons 3 and 4.\n    *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n\n**Drawing the structure and counting the atoms:**\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** We can deduce the number of hydrogens by ensuring each carbon has four bonds.\n    *   Ring hydrogens: 7\n    *   -COOH hydrogen: 1\n    *   -CHO hydrogen: 1\n    *   -CH=CH₂ hydrogens: 3\n    *   Total hydrogens = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent.\n\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\nEssentially, all oxygen-containing functional groups and sites of unsaturation (double/triple bonds) are completely reduced to a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will convert the starting material into a saturated hydrocarbon while preserving the original carbon skeleton.\n\n*   The C₁₀ carbon skeleton will remain.\n*   The carboxylic acid group, formyl group, and both vinyl and ring double bonds will be fully reduced.\n*   All oxygen atoms will be removed.\n*   The initial ring structure will remain, but it will become a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe product will be a C₁₀ saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is **CₙH₂ₙ**. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms.\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 indicates the presence of either one ring or one double bond. Since the reaction with red P and HI reduces all double bonds, the IHD of 1 must correspond to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane skeleton.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Structure:** It has a six-membered ring (cyclohexene) with one double bond.\n    *   **Functional Groups:**\n        *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1.\n        *   A formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO) at position 2.\n        *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n        *   A carbon-carbon double bond within the cyclohexene ring (at position 3).\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of the Starting Material:**\n    *   The core ring is cyclohexene.

Let's determine its molecular formula:\n*   The base structure is a cyclohex-3-ene ring.\n*   At position 1, there is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   At position 2, there is a formyl group (-CHO).\n*   At position 5, there is a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in the carboxyl group + 1 in the formyl group + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** We start with a cyclohexene ring (C₆H₁₀) and substitute at positions 1, 2, and 5. This gives a C₆H₇ core. Adding the hydrogens from the substituents: 7 (core) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 3 (in -CH=CH₂) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in the carboxyl group + 1 in the formyl group = 3 oxygens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using the formula: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For C₁₀H₁₂O₃, the IHD is:\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\nTherefore, all the sites of unsaturation and all oxygen-containing functional groups in the starting material will be completely reduced.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product\n\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring will be reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 will be reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at position 2 will be reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 will be reduced to an ethyl group.\n\nThe final product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the IHD of the Product\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of the product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the cyclohexane ring + 1 in the first methyl group + 1 in the second methyl group + 2 in the ethyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** A cyclohexane ring has the formula C₆H₁₂. We replace three hydrogen atoms with the substituent groups, leaving C₆H₉. Adding the hydrogens from the substituents: 9 (ring) + 3 (first methyl) + 3 (second methyl) + 5 (ethyl) = 20 hydrogens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nNow, we calculate the IHD for the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, the IHD represents the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, is a saturated cycloalkane. It contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Therefore, its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully determined the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reaction product.\n\nThe starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, undergoes complete reduction with red phosphorus and excess HI. This powerful reducing agent converts all functional groups (carboxylic acid, aldehyde) and unsaturations (C=C double bonds) into a saturated hydrocarbon while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n\nThe initial molecule has 10 carbon atoms. The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane) with the molecular formula C10H20.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency was calculated using the formula IHD = C + 1 - (H/2):\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nAn IHD of 1 indicates the presence of one ring, which is consistent with the final product being a substituted cyclohexane.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first identify the starting material and the product formed after the reaction.\n\n**1. Starting Material and its Molecular Formula**\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene ring**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1.\n    *   A formyl group (-CHO) at position 2.\n    *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n\nCounting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CHO group + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 7 on the ring structure + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 3 in the vinyl group = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**2. Reaction and Product**\n\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces various functional groups to their corresponding alkanes:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\nApplying this to the starting material:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid at position 1 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at position 2 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is **4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n**3. Molecular Formula of the Product**\n\nNow, let's determine the molecular formula for 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 in the cyclohexane ring + 2 from the two methyl groups + 2 from the ethyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: A saturated cyclohexane ring has the formula CₙH₂ₙ, which for C₁₀ would be C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for calculating IHD is:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms. Oxygen and halogen atoms do not affect the basic calculation.\n\nFor the product with the formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of one ring (the cyclohexane ring) in the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer**: My goal is to determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the final product. To do this, I first need to identify the starting material's structure and molecular formula. Then, I must understand the reaction that occurs when \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\" is treated with red phosphorus and excess HI. This reagent is a strong reducing agent, and I need to determine which of the functional groups (aldehyde, carboxylic acid, and the two C=C double bonds) it will reduce. Once the product's structure is determined, I can find its molecular formula and calculate the IHD. My first action will be to search for the reactivity of these specific functional groups with red phosphorus and HI.\n\n**Skeptic**: This approach is sound, but the critical point is the scope of the reduction by red phosphorus and HI. While it's well-known for reducing oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to alkanes, its effect on carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) is less common knowledge and must be verified. If the double bonds are also reduced, the IHD will be significantly lower than if they are not. A simple search might not be enough; we need to be certain about the reaction's outcome on all parts of the molecule.\n\n**Decide**: The immediate and most crucial step is to confirm the extent of the reduction caused by red phosphorus and excess HI, specifically whether it affects carbon-carbon double bonds in addition to the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups.\n\n**Proposer**: The search results confirm that red phosphorus with excess HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is capable of reducing carboxylic acids and aldehydes completely to their corresponding alkanes. Some sources also indicate that it can reduce alkenes (C=C double bonds) and alkynes. Therefore, my hypothesis is that all functional groups in the starting material will be reduced to a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\n**Skeptic**: While the evidence is strong for the reduction of the oxygen-containing functional groups, the reduction of alkenes by this method is less consistently documented and can sometimes be substrate-dependent. However, given the \"excess HI\" condition and the general description of this reagent as one of the strongest, it is reasonable to assume the reduction of the double bonds as well. Let's proceed with this assumption, but it's the most likely point of error if the answer is incorrect.\n\n**Decide**: We will proceed by determining the product under the assumption that the reagent reduces the aldehyde, the carboxylic acid, and both carbon-carbon double bonds. We will then calculate the IHD of this final, fully saturated product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   Let's determine its molecular formula.\n        *   The core structure is a cyclohexene ring: C6.\n        *   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH): C1, O2, H1.\n        *   It has a formyl group (-CHO): C1, O1, H1.\n        *   It has a vinyl group (-CH=CH2): C2, H3.\n        *   Let's assemble the full carbon skeleton: A 6-membered ring with a 1-carbon chain (from COOH), another 1-carbon chain (from CHO), and a 2-carbon chain (from the vinyl group). This gives a total of 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 carbon atoms.\n    *   The final product will be a saturated hydrocarbon derivative of this C10 skeleton.\n\n2.  **Reaction**: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and excess HI.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The aldehyde group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n    *   The double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond, converting the vinyl group to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Product Structure**:\n    *   The starting `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `2-formyl` group becomes a `2-methyl` group.\n    *   The `5-vinyl` group becomes a `5-ethyl` group.\n    *   The `1-carboxylic acid` group becomes a `1-methyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n4.  **Molecular Formula of the Product**:\n    *   The product is a saturated cycloalkane with alkyl substituents. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n    *   Our product has a C10 skeleton (C6 ring + C1 methyl + C1 methyl + C2 ethyl = C10).\n    *   Since it is a single-ring alkane, its formula should be CnH2n.\n    *   For C10, the formula is C10H20.\n\n5.  **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation**:\n    *   The IHD formula is: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   For the product C10H20:\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 0/2 + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   IHD = 1\n\n    Alternatively, the IHD represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n*   Starting material correctly identified.\n*   Reaction's effect on all functional groups determined based on search results.\n*   Product structure correctly predicted based on the reaction.\n*   Molecular formula of the product (C10H20) is correct for a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   IHD calculation is correct based on both the formula and the structure (one ring).\n\nThe debate converges. The reasoning is sound based on the available information.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
