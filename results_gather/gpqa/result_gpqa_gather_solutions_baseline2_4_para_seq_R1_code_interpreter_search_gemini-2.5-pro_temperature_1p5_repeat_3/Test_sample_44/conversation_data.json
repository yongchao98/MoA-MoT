An analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles and the numerical calculations, with discrepancies only arising from the final matching of the result to different multiple-choice lists.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**1. Foundational Principles & Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** The particles have spin-1/2, which makes them **fermions**. As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This is the most critical starting point. Mistaking them for bosons would lead to an incorrect ground state where all particles occupy the n=1 level.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Quantum State Occupancy.** The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a state is defined by both the energy quantum number `n` (1, 2, 3...) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (+1/2 or -1/2). This implies that each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles (one with spin-up, one with spin-down).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in the *n*-th level is given as $E_n = n^2 E$. The energies for the lowest levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nTo find the lowest possible energy for the system (the ground state), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the two-particle limit per level.\n*   Two particles occupy the `n=1` level. Their energy contribution is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles occupy the `n=2` level. Their energy contribution is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Finding the *Lowest* Energy Excitation.** The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by the \"cheapest\" possible promotion of a single particle.\n*   We promote one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for the first excited state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Finding the *Second-Lowest* Energy Excitation.** This is the state with the next-lowest energy. We must systematically consider different possible excitations from the ground state to find the correct one.\n    *   **Excitation A (already found):** Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Total energy = 15E. This is the first excited state.\n    *   **Excitation B:** Promote a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes: {one particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3}. The total energy is $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   **Excitation C:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The total energy is $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 18E = \\mathbf{20E}$.\n    *   **Excitation D:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The total energy is $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = \\mathbf{22E}$.\n*   Comparing the possible energies in increasing order {10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, ...}, we see that the second excited state has an energy of **18E**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states of the system are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nMatching this sequence to the provided options:\nA) 10E, 15E, 18E\nB) 30E, 39E, 50E\nC) 4E, 10E, 50E\nD) 4E, 10E, 15E\n\nThe calculated energies correspond exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all candidate answers and the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, here is a definitive step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Foundational Principles:**\n*   The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n*   Identical fermions are governed by the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two such particles can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   A particle's quantum state in this system is defined by two numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n*   As a result of spin, each energy level `n` is doubly degenerate and can hold a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n*   The energy of a single particle in the n-th level of a 1D infinite potential well is $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   Therefore, the energy of the single-particle levels can be written as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation:**\n*   The ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We find this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation:**\n*   The first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest total energy. This is achieved by performing the lowest-cost excitation from the ground state, which is moving one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new particle configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation:**\n*   The second excited state has the third-lowest total energy. We must find the next lowest-energy configuration after the first excited state. This requires comparing the energies of different possible excitations from the ground state.\n    *   **Excitation A (already found):** Move one particle from `n=2 → n=3`. Total energy = 15E.\n    *   **Excitation B:** Move one particle from the lower `n=1` level to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: {1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n        *   Total Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   **Excitation C:** Promote two particles from `n=2 → n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 0 particles in n=2, 2 particles in n=3}.\n        *   Total Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 18E = \\mathbf{20E}$.\n*   Comparing the possible energies in increasing order—{10E, 15E, 18E, 20E...}—the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Particle Statistics:** The most crucial aspect is identifying the particles as fermions and applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Mistaking them for bosons would lead to an incorrect ground state energy of $4 \\times E_1 = 4E$.\n2.  **Spin Degeneracy:** One must account for the two possible spin states (`m_s` = +1/2, -1/2), which allows two fermions to occupy the same energy level `n`. Forgetting this would lead one to place each particle in a different level (n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4), resulting in a wrong ground state energy of $1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$.\n3.  **Systematic Search for Excited States:** Finding the first and second excited states requires a systematic search for the configurations with the lowest and next-lowest energies above the ground state. It is essential to calculate and compare the total energy of different possible excitations to find the correct order.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll provided candidate answers correctly perform the physical calculation, arriving at a unanimous conclusion for the energy values:\n*   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n*   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n*   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nThe sequence of energies is **{10E, 15E, 18E}**.

All candidate answers, despite their differing final letter choices, show a unanimous agreement on the underlying physical calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Foundational Principles**\n\nThe problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles. The following principles are key to the solution.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** Spin-1/2 particles are **fermions**. This is the most crucial identification, as it dictates which statistical rules to apply.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Pauli Exclusion Principle.** As identical fermions, the particles must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two particles can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Defining a Quantum State.** For this system, a quantum state is fully defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (n=1, 2, 3...), which determines the energy, and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (`+1/2` for spin-up or `-1/2` for spin-down).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Energy Level Occupancy.** Because of the two possible spin states (`m_s`), each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Misunderstanding this point would lead to an incorrect answer.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy of a single particle in the n-th level is given by $E_n = n^2 E$, where $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nThe first few energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nTo find the ground state (lowest total energy), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the two-particle limit per level.\n*   Place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy *above* the ground state.\n*   **Careful Point 5: The Cheapest Excitation.** This state is found by making the lowest-energy jump possible for a single particle. This means moving one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=3`}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThis is the configuration with the third-lowest total energy.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Systematic Search.** We must systematically identify the next-lowest energy jump from the ground state.\n    *   The first excitation (n=2 → n=3) resulted in a total energy of **15E**.\n    *   Consider the next possible excitation: moving a particle from a lower level, n=1, to the lowest unoccupied level, n=3. The configuration becomes {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. The total energy is $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   Other excitations, such as promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 (Total Energy = 22E) or promoting two particles (Total Energy = 20E), are more energetic.\n*   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nComparing this calculated sequence with the provided options:\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\nB) 4E, 10E, 50E\nC) 10E, 15E, 18E\nD) 4E, 10E, 15E\n\nThe result (10E, 15E, 18E) exactly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points derived from the consensus among the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify Particle Type and Governing Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are classified as **fermions**.\n*   **Guiding Rule:** Identical fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle is the cornerstone of the solution.\n*   **Defining a State:** A quantum state for a particle in this system is fully defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Occupancy):** The Pauli Exclusion Principle states no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state (`n` and `m_s`). This means for any given energy level `n`, you can place a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**2. Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   The energy of a single particle in the *n*-th state of a 1D infinite well is $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   Therefore, the energy of each level is simply $E_n = n^2 E$. The first few are:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Calculate the Ground State Energy (Lowest Energy State)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Aufbau Principle):** To find the ground state, we must fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, respecting the two-particle limit per level.\n*   **n=1 level:** Place two particles. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   **n=2 level:** Place the remaining two particles. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** Sum the energies: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\bf{10E}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (Next-Lowest Energy State)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Systematic Excitation):** The first excited state is the configuration with the *lowest possible energy* above the ground state. We achieve this with the \"cheapest\" possible promotion of one particle.\n*   **Promotion:** The lowest energy promotion is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   **New Configuration:** {2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`}.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:** $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\bf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (Third-Lowest Energy State)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Finding the Correct State):** We must now find the next distinct energy configuration above the first excited state. It is crucial to check different possibilities to ensure we have found the *second*-lowest excitation, not just a random higher one.\n*   The ground state energy is 10E, and the first excited state energy is 15E. Let's explore other low-energy excitations from the ground state:\n    *   **Possibility A (from `n=1` to `n=3`):** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: {1 particle in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`}.\n        *   Energy: $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\bf{18E}$.\n    *   **Possibility B (two from `n=2` to `n=3`):**\n        *   Configuration: {2 particles in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=3`}.\n        *   Energy: $(2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = \\bf{20E}$.\n*   Comparing the energies, the third-lowest unique energy value for the system is 18E.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the universally agreed-upon calculations from fundamental principles:\n*   Ground State Energy: **10E**\n*   First Excited State Energy: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State Energy: **18E**\n\nThe sequence of energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state is (10E, 15E, 18E). This sequence exactly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the problem and the consistent reasoning provided by all candidate answers, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of this problem is to apply the principles of quantum statistics to a system of multiple identical particles in a potential well.\n\n**1. Analyze the Particles and Governing Principles**\n\n*   **Particles as Fermions:** The problem states there are four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This is the most critical principle for this problem. It dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Defining a Quantum State:** For a particle in this system, its quantum state is defined by two numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin quantum number, `m_s` (either +1/2 for \"spin-up\" or -1/2 for \"spin-down\").\n*   **Energy Level Occupancy:** Since a state is defined by both `n` and `m_s`, the states `(n=1, m_s=+1/2)` and `(n=1, m_s=-1/2)` are distinct. Therefore, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles: one spin-up and one spin-down.\n\n**2. Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy of a single particle in the n-th level is given as $E_n = n^2 E$. The first few levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Calculate the Ground State Energy**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the occupancy rule.\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state has the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by performing the \"cheapest\" possible excitation, which is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThis is the state with the third-lowest total energy. We must find the next-cheapest excitation from the ground state.\n*   The first excitation (n=2 → n=3) had an energy of 15E.\n*   Let's check the next possibility: promoting a particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest unoccupied level, `n=3`.\n    *   The configuration becomes: {1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n    *   Total energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   Other promotions, like moving two particles (2 → 3 twice, total E=20E) or moving one to a higher level (2 → 4, total E=22E), cost more energy.\n*   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Fermions vs. Bosons:** One must recognize the particles are fermions and obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. If they were bosons, all four would occupy the n=1 state, giving a ground state energy of $4 \\times 1E = 4E$. This is a common wrong answer.\n2.  **Spin Inclusion:** The Pauli Principle applies to the full quantum state (`n`, `m_s`). The inclusion of spin (`m_s` = ±1/2) is what allows **two** fermions per energy level `n`. Forgetting this and allowing only one fermion per `n` would lead to an incorrect ground state configuration in levels n=1, 2, 3, and 4, for an energy of $1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$.\n3.  **Systematic Excitation:** To find the second excited state, one must not assume it's simply the next-highest jump from the same level (e.g., n=2 to n=4). It must be the configuration with the third-lowest total energy in the entire system, which requires comparing the costs of different possible promotions.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the physics, which is unanimously agreed upon by all provided candidate answers, gives the following energies:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nComparing this sequence with the multiple-choice options provided:\nA) 10E, 15E, 18E\nB) 30E, 39E, 50E\nC) 4E, 10E, 15E\nD) 4E, 10E, 50E\n\nThe calculated energies match option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the provided candidate answers, all of them correctly apply the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics to solve the problem. The discrepancy in their final letter choices arises from variations in the multiple-choice options they were presented with, not from any disagreement in the physics. Here is a consolidated step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer for the options provided in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. System Identification and Governing Principles**\n*   **Particle Type:** The system consists of four identical **spin-1/2 particles**. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are classified as **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Rule:** As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **State Definition:** A quantum state for a particle in this system is uniquely defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\n**Careful Point 1: State Occupancy**\nA crucial implication of the Pauli Exclusion Principle is that each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down. Treating the particles as bosons (which have no such restriction) or spinless fermions (one per level) would lead to incorrect results.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given by $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, which simplifies the energy levels to:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n...and so on.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation**\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We achieve this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   Two particles fill the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles fill the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest total energy. This is achieved by the lowest-energy promotion from the ground state.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Identifying the Correct Excitation**\nThe lowest-energy or \"cheapest\" excitation involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\nThe second excited state has the third-lowest total energy. We must systematically check for the next-lowest energy configuration.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Systematically Finding the Next State**\nWe must compare the energies of different possible excitations to ensure we find the correct one.\n*   The ground state energy is **10E**.\n*   The first excited state energy is **15E** (from promoting a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`).\n*   Consider the next-cheapest promotion: moving a particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest available level, `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Total Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + (2 \\times 4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   Consider other promotions: e.g., promoting a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. This would result in a total energy of $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\nSince 18E is lower than 22E and other possibilities, it is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe step-by-step calculation, which is unanimously supported by the reasoning in all provided candidate answers, yields the following energies:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThe sequence of energies is (10E, 15E, 18E). We now compare this result to the multiple-choice options provided in the question:\nA) 4E, 10E, 15E\nB) 4E, 10E, 50E\nC) 10E, 15E, 18E\nD) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nThe calculated energies match option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the problem and the candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles and calculations, with discrepancies only arising from the agents having different multiple-choice options. Here is a definitive step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and Governing Principles**\nThis is the most critical step and contains several key points that must be handled correctly.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Identity.** The system has four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**. This dictates the rules they must follow.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Pauli Exclusion Principle.** As identical fermions, they are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Defining a Quantum State.** For this system, a particle's state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Energy Level Occupancy.** The consequence of the two possible spin states is that each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down) without violating the exclusion principle. Mistaking this (e.g., thinking only one particle per level, or treating them as bosons) is a common error.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th state of a 1D infinite well is $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels are simply:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the occupancy rule from Careful Point 4.\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible energy jump for one particle: from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy of this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\nThis state has the next lowest energy. We must systematically check other possible low-energy promotions from the ground state to find the one with the second-lowest energy cost.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Finding the *Next* Lowest State.** We must compare the total energy of different excited configurations.\n*   **Excitation A (already found):** Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. The total energy is **15E**.\n*   **Excitation B:** Promote a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   The new configuration is: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   Total energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   Other excitations, like promoting a particle from `n=2` to `n=4` (Total Energy = 22E) or promoting two particles from `n=2` to `n=3` (Total Energy = 20E), result in higher energies.\n\nThe ordered list of the lowest possible total energies for the system is {10E, 15E, 18E, ...}.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis sequence must be matched to the options provided in the question:\nA) 10E, 15E, 18E\nB) 4E, 10E, 50E\nC) 30E, 39E, 50E\nD) 4E, 10E, 15E\n\nThe calculated energies `10E, 15E, 18E` exactly match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and a thorough review of the physics problem, the following step-by-step reasoning is established.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Particle Type and Governing Principles**\nThe system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are classified as **fermions**. Identical fermions are subject to the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\n**Step 2: Define Quantum States and Occupancy Rules**\nFor a particle in this 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n\nThe Pauli Exclusion Principle thus dictates that each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**Step 3: Define Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th level is given by $E_n = n^2 E$, where $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nThe first few energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We find this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, following the occupancy rule.\n*   Place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible energy promotion for one particle, which is from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\nThe second excited state has the next-lowest total energy. We must systematically compare possible excitations from the ground state to find the configuration with the third-lowest energy overall.\n*   The ground state energy is 10E.\n*   The first excited state energy is 15E (from the `n=2 → n=3` promotion).\n*   Consider the next-cheapest promotion from the ground state: moving a particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest available level, `n=3`.\n    *   The new configuration is: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is: $E = (1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   Since other excitations (like `n=2 → n=4` or exciting two particles) yield even higher energies (22E, 20E, etc.), the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Fermions vs. Bosons**: A primary point of error would be treating the particles as bosons. If they were bosons, all four would occupy the n=1 state, yielding a ground state energy of 4E. This correctly identifies why option A (4E, 10E, 15E) is incorrect for the ground state.\n2.  **Spinless vs. Spin-1/2 Fermions**: Another critical point is the spin. If one forgot about spin and treated the particles as spinless fermions, only one particle could occupy each energy level. The ground state would then be $E_1+E_2+E_3+E_4 = 1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$. This highlights why option B (30E, 39E, 50E) is incorrect.\n3.  **Systematic Excitation**: When determining excited states, one must find the configuration with the next-lowest *total system energy*, not just the next-lowest energy jump for a single particle. It is crucial to list possible configurations and order them by their total energy (10E, 15E, 18E, ...).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unanimous conclusion from the physical calculations performed by all 15 agents is that the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E**, **15E**, and **18E**, respectively.

Foundational Principles:**\nThe system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles.\n*   **Particle Type:** Particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Rule:** As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Defining a Quantum State:** For a particle in this 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up `+1/2` or spin-down `-1/2`).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th level of the potential well is given as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   Energy of the n=1 level: $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   Energy of the n=2 level: $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   Energy of the n=3 level: $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   Energy of the n=4 level: $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation:**\nThe ground state is the lowest possible total energy for the four-particle system. We fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy contribution is $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. The energy contribution is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation:**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy just above the ground state. This is found by making the least \"expensive\" energy promotion for a single particle.\n*   Promote one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation:**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must systematically check other possible promotions from the ground state.\n*   The ground state energy is 10E.\n*   The first excited state energy (from promoting `n=2` to `n=3`) is 15E.\n*   Consider another low-energy promotion: move a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   The configuration becomes: {1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n    *   Total energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   This energy (18E) is lower than other possibilities like promoting from `n=2` to `n=4` (Total E = 22E).\n*   The ordered list of the lowest possible total energies is {10E, 15E, 18E, ...}. Therefore, the second excited state has energy **18E**.\n\n### Careful Points in This Problem\n\n1.  **Fermions vs. Bosons:** It is crucial to recognize that spin-1/2 particles are fermions and obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. A common error is to treat them as bosons, which would incorrectly place all four particles in the n=1 state for a ground state energy of 4E.\n2.  **State Occupancy:** One must correctly apply the exclusion principle. A \"quantum state\" includes spin, so each energy level `n` can accommodate two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down), not just one.\n3.  **Systematic Excitation:** To find the first and second excited states, one cannot just pick any excited configuration. It is necessary to find the configurations with the lowest and second-lowest total energy above the ground state by systematically comparing the energy costs of different promotions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis reveals unanimous agreement among all provided agents on the physical calculation, which is robust.\n*   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n*   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n*   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nComparing this calculated sequence to the provided multiple-choice options:\nA) 4E, 10E, 50E\nB) 4E, 10E, 15E\nC) 10E, 15E, 18E\nD) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nThe calculated energies match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the unanimous reasoning found in the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points required for the calculation.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe goal is to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Particle Type and Governing Principles**\nThe particles are specified as \"spin-1/2,\" which means they are **fermions**.

This principle is the cornerstone of the solution; it dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the exact same quantum state.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Defining a Quantum State and Occupancy**\nFor a particle in this potential well, a quantum state is defined by two numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be `+1/2` for spin-up or `-1/2` for spin-down). Because spin is part of the quantum state, the Pauli Exclusion Principle allows each energy level `n` to accommodate a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down. Forgetting the spin and allowing only one particle per level is a common error.\n\n**1.

Analyze the System and Governing Principles**\n\n*   **Particles as Fermions:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.

In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are classified as **fermions**.\n    *   As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n    *   For this system, a particle's quantum state is fully defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy of a single particle in the n-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given by $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    *   Using the problem's definition of the base energy unit, $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels simplify to $E_n = n^2 E$.\n    *   The first few single-particle energy levels are:\n        *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n        *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n        *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n        *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n3.  **Ground State Energy Calculation:**\n    *   To find the ground state (the lowest possible total energy), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n    *   Two particles are placed in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n    *   The remaining two particles are placed in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\bf{10E}$.\n\n4.  **First Excited State Energy Calculation:**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest total energy. This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible energy promotion from the ground state.\n    *   One particle is promoted from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n    *   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n    *   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2E) + (4E) + (9E) = \\bf{15E}$.\n\n5.  **Second Excited State Energy Calculation:**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the third-lowest total energy.

If they were bosons, all four would occupy the n=1 state, leading to a completely different answer (4E).\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle Application:** The correct application of the Pauli Exclusion Principle means that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down), not just one. A misinterpretation here would also lead to an incorrect result (30E).\n*   **Systematic Excitation:** To find the first and second excited states, one must systematically identify the lowest-energy promotions from the ground state. The first excited state comes from the single-particle jump `n=2 → n=3`. The second excited state comes from the single-particle jump `n=1 → n=3`, which has a lower total energy than other possibilities like `n=2 → n=4` or exciting two particles simultaneously.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E**, **15E**, and **18E**, respectively.

The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n\n**2. Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   The energy of a single particle in the *n*-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given by $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels simplify to $E_n = n^2 E$. The first few are:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We find it by filling the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy. This is achieved by the \"cheapest\" possible promotion of one particle: from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy of this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state has the third-lowest total energy. We must systematically consider other possible promotions from the ground state to find the next lowest energy level.\n\n*   We compare the energies of the next possible excited configurations:\n    *   **Configuration A (First Excited State):** {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. Total Energy = **15E**.\n    *   **Configuration B:** Promote a particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest unoccupied level, `n=3`. This gives {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. Total Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   **Configuration C:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. This gives {2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3}. Total Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 18E = \\mathbf{20E}$.\n*   Ranking the lowest total energies gives: 10E, 15E, 18E, ...\n*   The energy of the second excited state is therefore **18E**.\n\n---\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Fermion Statistics:** The most critical point is recognizing that spin-1/2 particles are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Treating them as bosons (which would put all four particles in the `n=1` state for a ground state energy of 4E) is a common mistake.\n2.  **Spin Occupancy:** One must account for the two spin states (`+1/2` and `-1/2`). This is why each energy level `n` can accommodate up to **two** particles, not just one.\n3.  **Systematic Search for Excitations:** To find the second excited state, it is not enough to just look at the next available energy level for promotion (e.g., n=2 to n=4). All low-energy possibilities must be compared. In this case, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 results in a lower total energy (18E) than promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 (22E).\n\n---\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step calculation, which aligns with the consensus reasoning found in all the candidate answers, the energies are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, consolidating the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting crucial points for accuracy.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1.

According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A fundamental rule for identical fermions is the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Careful Point #1: Defining a Quantum State:** For a particle in this 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by *two* quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which is either +1/2 (spin-up) or -1/2 (spin-down).\n*   **Energy Level Occupancy:** Because each energy level `n` has two available spin states, it can hold a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down) without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Mistaking the particles as spinless (or as bosons) would lead to an incorrect answer.\n\n**2.

Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation (E_1st):**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy *above* the ground state. This is achieved by the smallest possible energy jump for one particle, which is from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n\n*   The ground state configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2}.\n*   The first excited state configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation (E_2nd):**\n\nThe second excited state has the next-lowest energy. We must systematically consider other possible low-energy excitations from the ground state to find the correct one.\n\n*   **Careful Point #2: Systematic Search for Excitations:** We cannot assume the next excitation is obvious. We must compare the total energies of different possible configurations. Let's compare promotions of a single particle from the ground state:\n    *   **Excitation A (already found):** Promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3 gives a total energy of **15E**. (The energy cost is ΔE = E₃ - E₂ = 9E - 4E = 5E).\n    *   **Excitation B:** Promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3. The new configuration is {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. The total energy is $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$. (The energy cost is ΔE = E₃ - E₁ = 9E - 1E = 8E).\n    *   **Excitation C:** Promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 gives a total energy of $2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$. (The energy cost is ΔE = E₄ - E₂ = 16E - 4E = 12E).\n\n*   By ranking the total system energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...}, we see the three lowest energies are 10E, 15E, and 18E.\n\n**Final Calculated Energies:**\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the unanimous reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1.

The total energy is $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   **Other Promotions:** Promotions like `n=2` to `n=4` or exciting two particles result in higher total energies (22E, 20E, etc.).\n\nBy ordering the possible total energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, ...}, we find that the second excited state has an energy of **18E**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Fermions vs. Bosons:** It is crucial to identify the particles as fermions. If they were bosons, all four would occupy the n=1 level, giving a ground state energy of $4 \\times 1E = 4E$. This highlights why options starting with 4E are incorrect.\n2.  **Spin Occupancy:** The Pauli Exclusion Principle applies to the full quantum state (`n`, `m_s`). This means each energy level `n` can hold **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Forgetting this and allowing only one fermion per energy level `n` would result in a ground state configuration of {1 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4}, giving a total energy of $1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$. This highlights why the option starting with 30E is incorrect.\n3.  **Systematic Excitation:** To find the second excited state, one must find the configuration with the third-lowest *total system energy*. Simply looking at the next jump for a single particle (e.g., from n=2 to n=4) is not sufficient. One must compare the total energy of different configurations. The jump from `n=1` to `n=3` (Total E = 18E) results in a lower total system energy than the jump from `n=2` to `n=4` (Total E = 22E).\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe unanimously calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E**, **15E**, and **18E**, respectively.

An analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles and the numerical calculations, with discrepancies only arising from the final matching of the result to different multiple-choice lists.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**1. Foundational Principles & Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** The particles have spin-1/2, which makes them **fermions**. As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This is the most critical starting point. Mistaking them for bosons would lead to an incorrect ground state where all particles occupy the n=1 level.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Quantum State Occupancy.** The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a state is defined by both the energy quantum number `n` (1, 2, 3...) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (+1/2 or -1/2). This implies that each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles (one with spin-up, one with spin-down).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in the *n*-th level is given as $E_n = n^2 E$. The energies for the lowest levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nTo find the lowest possible energy for the system (the ground state), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the two-particle limit per level.\n*   Two particles occupy the `n=1` level. Their energy contribution is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles occupy the `n=2` level. Their energy contribution is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Finding the *Lowest* Energy Excitation.** The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by the \"cheapest\" possible promotion of a single particle.\n*   We promote one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for the first excited state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Finding the *Second-Lowest* Energy Excitation.** This is the state with the next-lowest energy. We must systematically consider different possible excitations from the ground state to find the correct one.\n    *   **Excitation A (already found):** Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Total energy = 15E. This is the first excited state.\n    *   **Excitation B:** Promote a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes: {one particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3}. The total energy is $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   **Excitation C:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The total energy is $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 18E = \\mathbf{20E}$.\n    *   **Excitation D:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The total energy is $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = \\mathbf{22E}$.\n*   Comparing the possible energies in increasing order {10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, ...}, we see that the second excited state has an energy of **18E**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states of the system are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nMatching this sequence to the provided options:\nA) 10E, 15E, 18E\nB) 30E, 39E, 50E\nC) 4E, 10E, 50E\nD) 4E, 10E, 15E\n\nThe calculated energies correspond exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all candidate answers and the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, here is a definitive step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Foundational Principles:**\n*   The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n*   Identical fermions are governed by the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two such particles can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   A particle's quantum state in this system is defined by two numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n*   As a result of spin, each energy level `n` is doubly degenerate and can hold a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n*   The energy of a single particle in the n-th level of a 1D infinite potential well is $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   Therefore, the energy of the single-particle levels can be written as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation:**\n*   The ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We find this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation:**\n*   The first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest total energy. This is achieved by performing the lowest-cost excitation from the ground state, which is moving one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new particle configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation:**\n*   The second excited state has the third-lowest total energy. We must find the next lowest-energy configuration after the first excited state. This requires comparing the energies of different possible excitations from the ground state.\n    *   **Excitation A (already found):** Move one particle from `n=2 → n=3`. Total energy = 15E.\n    *   **Excitation B:** Move one particle from the lower `n=1` level to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: {1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n        *   Total Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   **Excitation C:** Promote two particles from `n=2 → n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 0 particles in n=2, 2 particles in n=3}.\n        *   Total Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 18E = \\mathbf{20E}$.\n*   Comparing the possible energies in increasing order—{10E, 15E, 18E, 20E...}—the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Particle Statistics:** The most crucial aspect is identifying the particles as fermions and applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Mistaking them for bosons would lead to an incorrect ground state energy of $4 \\times E_1 = 4E$.\n2.  **Spin Degeneracy:** One must account for the two possible spin states (`m_s` = +1/2, -1/2), which allows two fermions to occupy the same energy level `n`. Forgetting this would lead one to place each particle in a different level (n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4), resulting in a wrong ground state energy of $1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$.\n3.  **Systematic Search for Excited States:** Finding the first and second excited states requires a systematic search for the configurations with the lowest and next-lowest energies above the ground state. It is essential to calculate and compare the total energy of different possible excitations to find the correct order.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll provided candidate answers correctly perform the physical calculation, arriving at a unanimous conclusion for the energy values:\n*   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n*   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n*   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nThe sequence of energies is **{10E, 15E, 18E}**.

All candidate answers, despite their differing final letter choices, show a unanimous agreement on the underlying physical calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Foundational Principles**\n\nThe problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles. The following principles are key to the solution.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** Spin-1/2 particles are **fermions**. This is the most crucial identification, as it dictates which statistical rules to apply.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Pauli Exclusion Principle.** As identical fermions, the particles must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two particles can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Defining a Quantum State.** For this system, a quantum state is fully defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (n=1, 2, 3...), which determines the energy, and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (`+1/2` for spin-up or `-1/2` for spin-down).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Energy Level Occupancy.** Because of the two possible spin states (`m_s`), each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Misunderstanding this point would lead to an incorrect answer.\n\n**2.

Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nTo find the ground state (lowest total energy), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the two-particle limit per level.\n*   Place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy *above* the ground state.\n*   **Careful Point 5: The Cheapest Excitation.** This state is found by making the lowest-energy jump possible for a single particle. This means moving one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=3`}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThis is the configuration with the third-lowest total energy.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Systematic Search.** We must systematically identify the next-lowest energy jump from the ground state.\n    *   The first excitation (n=2 → n=3) resulted in a total energy of **15E**.\n    *   Consider the next possible excitation: moving a particle from a lower level, n=1, to the lowest unoccupied level, n=3. The configuration becomes {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. The total energy is $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   Other excitations, such as promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 (Total Energy = 22E) or promoting two particles (Total Energy = 20E), are more energetic.\n*   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nComparing this calculated sequence with the provided options:\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\nB) 4E, 10E, 50E\nC) 10E, 15E, 18E\nD) 4E, 10E, 15E\n\nThe result (10E, 15E, 18E) exactly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points derived from the consensus among the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1.

In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are classified as **fermions**.\n*   **Guiding Rule:** Identical fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle is the cornerstone of the solution.\n*   **Defining a State:** A quantum state for a particle in this system is fully defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Occupancy):** The Pauli Exclusion Principle states no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state (`n` and `m_s`). This means for any given energy level `n`, you can place a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**2. Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   The energy of a single particle in the *n*-th state of a 1D infinite well is $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   Therefore, the energy of each level is simply $E_n = n^2 E$.

We achieve this with the \"cheapest\" possible promotion of one particle.\n*   **Promotion:** The lowest energy promotion is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   **New Configuration:** {2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`}.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:** $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\bf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (Third-Lowest Energy State)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Finding the Correct State):** We must now find the next distinct energy configuration above the first excited state.

Analyze the Particles and Governing Principles**\n\n*   **Particles as Fermions:** The problem states there are four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This is the most critical principle for this problem. It dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Defining a Quantum State:** For a particle in this system, its quantum state is defined by two numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin quantum number, `m_s` (either +1/2 for \"spin-up\" or -1/2 for \"spin-down\").\n*   **Energy Level Occupancy:** Since a state is defined by both `n` and `m_s`, the states `(n=1, m_s=+1/2)` and `(n=1, m_s=-1/2)` are distinct.

Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state has the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by performing the \"cheapest\" possible excitation, which is to move one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThis is the state with the third-lowest total energy. We must find the next-cheapest excitation from the ground state.\n*   The first excitation (n=2 → n=3) had an energy of 15E.\n*   Let's check the next possibility: promoting a particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest unoccupied level, `n=3`.\n    *   The configuration becomes: {1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n    *   Total energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   Other promotions, like moving two particles (2 → 3 twice, total E=20E) or moving one to a higher level (2 → 4, total E=22E), cost more energy.\n*   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Fermions vs. Bosons:** One must recognize the particles are fermions and obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. If they were bosons, all four would occupy the n=1 state, giving a ground state energy of $4 \\times 1E = 4E$. This is a common wrong answer.\n2.  **Spin Inclusion:** The Pauli Principle applies to the full quantum state (`n`, `m_s`). The inclusion of spin (`m_s` = ±1/2) is what allows **two** fermions per energy level `n`. Forgetting this and allowing only one fermion per `n` would lead to an incorrect ground state configuration in levels n=1, 2, 3, and 4, for an energy of $1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$.\n3.  **Systematic Excitation:** To find the second excited state, one must not assume it's simply the next-highest jump from the same level (e.g., n=2 to n=4). It must be the configuration with the third-lowest total energy in the entire system, which requires comparing the costs of different possible promotions.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the physics, which is unanimously agreed upon by all provided candidate answers, gives the following energies:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nComparing this sequence with the multiple-choice options provided:\nA) 10E, 15E, 18E\nB) 30E, 39E, 50E\nC) 4E, 10E, 15E\nD) 4E, 10E, 50E\n\nThe calculated energies match option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the provided candidate answers, all of them correctly apply the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics to solve the problem. The discrepancy in their final letter choices arises from variations in the multiple-choice options they were presented with, not from any disagreement in the physics. Here is a consolidated step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer for the options provided in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. System Identification and Governing Principles**\n*   **Particle Type:** The system consists of four identical **spin-1/2 particles**. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are classified as **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Rule:** As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **State Definition:** A quantum state for a particle in this system is uniquely defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\n**Careful Point 1: State Occupancy**\nA crucial implication of the Pauli Exclusion Principle is that each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down. Treating the particles as bosons (which have no such restriction) or spinless fermions (one per level) would lead to incorrect results.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given by $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, which simplifies the energy levels to:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n...and so on.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation**\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We achieve this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   Two particles fill the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   The remaining two particles fill the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest total energy. This is achieved by the lowest-energy promotion from the ground state.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Identifying the Correct Excitation**\nThe lowest-energy or \"cheapest\" excitation involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\nThe second excited state has the third-lowest total energy. We must systematically check for the next-lowest energy configuration.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Systematically Finding the Next State**\nWe must compare the energies of different possible excitations to ensure we find the correct one.\n*   The ground state energy is **10E**.\n*   The first excited state energy is **15E** (from promoting a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`).\n*   Consider the next-cheapest promotion: moving a particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest available level, `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Total Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + (2 \\times 4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   Consider other promotions: e.g., promoting a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. This would result in a total energy of $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\nSince 18E is lower than 22E and other possibilities, it is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe step-by-step calculation, which is unanimously supported by the reasoning in all provided candidate answers, yields the following energies:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThe sequence of energies is (10E, 15E, 18E). We now compare this result to the multiple-choice options provided in the question:\nA) 4E, 10E, 15E\nB) 4E, 10E, 50E\nC) 10E, 15E, 18E\nD) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nThe calculated energies match option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the problem and the candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles and calculations, with discrepancies only arising from the agents having different multiple-choice options. Here is a definitive step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and Governing Principles**\nThis is the most critical step and contains several key points that must be handled correctly.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Particle Identity.** The system has four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**. This dictates the rules they must follow.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Pauli Exclusion Principle.** As identical fermions, they are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Defining a Quantum State.** For this system, a particle's state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Energy Level Occupancy.** The consequence of the two possible spin states is that each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down) without violating the exclusion principle. Mistaking this (e.g., thinking only one particle per level, or treating them as bosons) is a common error.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th state of a 1D infinite well is $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels are simply:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the occupancy rule from Careful Point 4.\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible energy jump for one particle: from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy of this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\nThis state has the next lowest energy. We must systematically check other possible low-energy promotions from the ground state to find the one with the second-lowest energy cost.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Finding the *Next* Lowest State.** We must compare the total energy of different excited configurations.\n*   **Excitation A (already found):** Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. The total energy is **15E**.\n*   **Excitation B:** Promote a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   The new configuration is: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   Total energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   Other excitations, like promoting a particle from `n=2` to `n=4` (Total Energy = 22E) or promoting two particles from `n=2` to `n=3` (Total Energy = 20E), result in higher energies.\n\nThe ordered list of the lowest possible total energies for the system is {10E, 15E, 18E, ...}.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis sequence must be matched to the options provided in the question:\nA) 10E, 15E, 18E\nB) 4E, 10E, 50E\nC) 30E, 39E, 50E\nD) 4E, 10E, 15E\n\nThe calculated energies `10E, 15E, 18E` exactly match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and a thorough review of the physics problem, the following step-by-step reasoning is established.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Particle Type and Governing Principles**\nThe system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are classified as **fermions**. Identical fermions are subject to the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\n**Step 2: Define Quantum States and Occupancy Rules**\nFor a particle in this 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n\nThe Pauli Exclusion Principle thus dictates that each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**Step 3: Define Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th level is given by $E_n = n^2 E$, where $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nThe first few energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We find this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, following the occupancy rule.\n*   Place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible energy promotion for one particle, which is from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\nThe second excited state has the next-lowest total energy. We must systematically compare possible excitations from the ground state to find the configuration with the third-lowest energy overall.\n*   The ground state energy is 10E.\n*   The first excited state energy is 15E (from the `n=2 → n=3` promotion).\n*   Consider the next-cheapest promotion from the ground state: moving a particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest available level, `n=3`.\n    *   The new configuration is: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is: $E = (1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   Since other excitations (like `n=2 → n=4` or exciting two particles) yield even higher energies (22E, 20E, etc.), the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Fermions vs. Bosons**: A primary point of error would be treating the particles as bosons. If they were bosons, all four would occupy the n=1 state, yielding a ground state energy of 4E. This correctly identifies why option A (4E, 10E, 15E) is incorrect for the ground state.\n2.  **Spinless vs. Spin-1/2 Fermions**: Another critical point is the spin. If one forgot about spin and treated the particles as spinless fermions, only one particle could occupy each energy level. The ground state would then be $E_1+E_2+E_3+E_4 = 1E+4E+9E+16E = 30E$. This highlights why option B (30E, 39E, 50E) is incorrect.\n3.  **Systematic Excitation**: When determining excited states, one must find the configuration with the next-lowest *total system energy*, not just the next-lowest energy jump for a single particle. It is crucial to list possible configurations and order them by their total energy (10E, 15E, 18E, ...).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unanimous conclusion from the physical calculations performed by all 15 agents is that the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E**, **15E**, and **18E**, respectively.

Foundational Principles:**\nThe system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles.\n*   **Particle Type:** Particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Rule:** As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Defining a Quantum State:** For a particle in this 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up `+1/2` or spin-down `-1/2`).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th level of the potential well is given as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   Energy of the n=1 level: $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   Energy of the n=2 level: $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   Energy of the n=3 level: $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   Energy of the n=4 level: $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation:**\nThe ground state is the lowest possible total energy for the four-particle system. We fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy contribution is $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. The energy contribution is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation:**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy just above the ground state. This is found by making the least \"expensive\" energy promotion for a single particle.\n*   Promote one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation:**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must systematically check other possible promotions from the ground state.\n*   The ground state energy is 10E.\n*   The first excited state energy (from promoting `n=2` to `n=3`) is 15E.\n*   Consider another low-energy promotion: move a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   The configuration becomes: {1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n    *   Total energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   This energy (18E) is lower than other possibilities like promoting from `n=2` to `n=4` (Total E = 22E).\n*   The ordered list of the lowest possible total energies is {10E, 15E, 18E, ...}. Therefore, the second excited state has energy **18E**.\n\n### Careful Points in This Problem\n\n1.  **Fermions vs. Bosons:** It is crucial to recognize that spin-1/2 particles are fermions and obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. A common error is to treat them as bosons, which would incorrectly place all four particles in the n=1 state for a ground state energy of 4E.\n2.  **State Occupancy:** One must correctly apply the exclusion principle. A \"quantum state\" includes spin, so each energy level `n` can accommodate two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down), not just one.\n3.  **Systematic Excitation:** To find the first and second excited states, one cannot just pick any excited configuration. It is necessary to find the configurations with the lowest and second-lowest total energy above the ground state by systematically comparing the energy costs of different promotions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis reveals unanimous agreement among all provided agents on the physical calculation, which is robust.\n*   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n*   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n*   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nComparing this calculated sequence to the provided multiple-choice options:\nA) 4E, 10E, 50E\nB) 4E, 10E, 15E\nC) 10E, 15E, 18E\nD) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nThe calculated energies match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the unanimous reasoning found in the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points required for the calculation.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe goal is to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Particle Type and Governing Principles**\nThe particles are specified as \"spin-1/2,\" which means they are **fermions**. As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle is the cornerstone of the solution; it dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the exact same quantum state.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Defining a Quantum State and Occupancy**\nFor a particle in this potential well, a quantum state is defined by two numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be `+1/2` for spin-up or `-1/2` for spin-down). Because spin is part of the quantum state, the Pauli Exclusion Principle allows each energy level `n` to accommodate a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down. Forgetting the spin and allowing only one particle per level is a common error.\n\n**1. Calculate Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy for a single particle in the n-th state is given by $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels simplify to $E_n = n^2 E$:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n...and so on.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n**Careful Point 3: Minimum Energy Configuration**\nThe ground state is the state of the lowest possible total energy.

Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n**Careful Point 4: The \"Cheapest\" Excitation**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy *above* the ground state. This is achieved by the smallest possible energy jump for one particle, which is from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: {two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**4.

Analyze the System and Governing Principles**\n\n*   **Particles as Fermions:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**. This is a critical starting point.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state.\n*   **Defining a Quantum State:** A particle's quantum state in this system is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal energy level `n` (where n = 1, 2, 3,...) and its spin orientation `m_s` (+1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n*   **Energy Level Occupancy:** The most important consequence of these principles is that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Mistaking this for one particle per level or an infinite number of particles per level would lead to an incorrect answer.\n\n**2.

Calculate the Ground State Energy (Lowest Energy)**\n\n*   To find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the two-particle limit per level.\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (Next-Lowest Energy)**\n\n*   The first excited state is the configuration with the smallest possible energy increase from the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (Third-Lowest Energy)**\n\n*   The second excited state has the next lowest energy. We must systematically check other possible low-energy promotions to find the correct one.\n*   **Promotion 1 (yields 1st excited state):** `n=2 → n=3`. Total energy = **15E**.\n*   **Promotion 2:** `n=1 → n=3`. Configuration: {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. Total energy: $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   **Other promotions** like `n=2 → n=4` (total energy 22E) or promoting two particles (total energy 20E or more) are more energetic.\n*   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis reveals the correct energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThe calculated sequence of energies is (10E, 15E, 18E). This sequence exactly matches option C in the provided question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on an analysis of the provided candidate answers, it is clear there is a unanimous consensus on the physics and the resulting calculations. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the agents being presented with differently ordered multiple-choice options. The following step-by-step analysis consolidates the correct, agreed-upon reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **System Identification and Governing Principles:**\n    *   The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are classified as **fermions**.\n    *   As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n    *   For this system, a particle's quantum state is fully defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy of a single particle in the n-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given by $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    *   Using the problem's definition of the base energy unit, $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels simplify to $E_n = n^2 E$.\n    *   The first few single-particle energy levels are:\n        *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n        *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n        *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n        *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n3.  **Ground State Energy Calculation:**\n    *   To find the ground state (the lowest possible total energy), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n    *   Two particles are placed in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n    *   The remaining two particles are placed in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\bf{10E}$.\n\n4.  **First Excited State Energy Calculation:**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest total energy. This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible energy promotion from the ground state.\n    *   One particle is promoted from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n    *   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n    *   The total energy for this state is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2E) + (4E) + (9E) = \\bf{15E}$.\n\n5.  **Second Excited State Energy Calculation:**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the third-lowest total energy. We must systematically find the next lowest-energy configuration after the first excited state.\n    *   The first excitation (n=2 → n=3) resulted in a total energy of 15E.\n    *   The next cheapest excitation involves promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   The configuration becomes: {1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n    *   The total energy is: $E_{2nd} = (1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\bf{18E}$.\n    *   Other excitations, such as promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 (Total Energy = 22E), are more energetic.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Particle Type is Key:** The fact that the particles are spin-1/2 **fermions** is the most crucial piece of information. If they were bosons, all four would occupy the n=1 state, leading to a completely different answer (4E).\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle Application:** The correct application of the Pauli Exclusion Principle means that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down), not just one. A misinterpretation here would also lead to an incorrect result (30E).\n*   **Systematic Excitation:** To find the first and second excited states, one must systematically identify the lowest-energy promotions from the ground state. The first excited state comes from the single-particle jump `n=2 → n=3`. The second excited state comes from the single-particle jump `n=1 → n=3`, which has a lower total energy than other possibilities like `n=2 → n=4` or exciting two particles simultaneously.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E**, **15E**, and **18E**, respectively.

In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   Identical fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two such particles can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   A particle's quantum state in this system is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (where n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n\n**2. Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   The energy of a single particle in the *n*-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given by $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels simplify to $E_n = n^2 E$. The first few are:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We find it by filling the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy. This is achieved by the \"cheapest\" possible promotion of one particle: from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy of this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state has the third-lowest total energy. We must systematically consider other possible promotions from the ground state to find the next lowest energy level.\n\n*   We compare the energies of the next possible excited configurations:\n    *   **Configuration A (First Excited State):** {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. Total Energy = **15E**.\n    *   **Configuration B:** Promote a particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest unoccupied level, `n=3`. This gives {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. Total Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   **Configuration C:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. This gives {2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3}. Total Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 18E = \\mathbf{20E}$.\n*   Ranking the lowest total energies gives: 10E, 15E, 18E, ...\n*   The energy of the second excited state is therefore **18E**.\n\n---\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Fermion Statistics:** The most critical point is recognizing that spin-1/2 particles are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Treating them as bosons (which would put all four particles in the `n=1` state for a ground state energy of 4E) is a common mistake.\n2.  **Spin Occupancy:** One must account for the two spin states (`+1/2` and `-1/2`). This is why each energy level `n` can accommodate up to **two** particles, not just one.\n3.  **Systematic Search for Excitations:** To find the second excited state, it is not enough to just look at the next available energy level for promotion (e.g., n=2 to n=4). All low-energy possibilities must be compared. In this case, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 results in a lower total energy (18E) than promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 (22E).\n\n---\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step calculation, which aligns with the consensus reasoning found in all the candidate answers, the energies are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, consolidating the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting crucial points for accuracy.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1.

According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A fundamental rule for identical fermions is the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Careful Point #1: Defining a Quantum State:** For a particle in this 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by *two* quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which is either +1/2 (spin-up) or -1/2 (spin-down).\n*   **Energy Level Occupancy:** Because each energy level `n` has two available spin states, it can hold a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up, one spin-down) without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Mistaking the particles as spinless (or as bosons) would lead to an incorrect answer.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in the *n*-th state is given by $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. This simplifies the single-particle energy levels to:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation (E_ground):**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n\n*   Place the first two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation (E_1st):**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy *above* the ground state. This is achieved by the smallest possible energy jump for one particle, which is from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n\n*   The ground state configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2}.\n*   The first excited state configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation (E_2nd):**\n\nThe second excited state has the next-lowest energy. We must systematically consider other possible low-energy excitations from the ground state to find the correct one.\n\n*   **Careful Point #2: Systematic Search for Excitations:** We cannot assume the next excitation is obvious. We must compare the total energies of different possible configurations. Let's compare promotions of a single particle from the ground state:\n    *   **Excitation A (already found):** Promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3 gives a total energy of **15E**. (The energy cost is ΔE = E₃ - E₂ = 9E - 4E = 5E).\n    *   **Excitation B:** Promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3. The new configuration is {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. The total energy is $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$. (The energy cost is ΔE = E₃ - E₁ = 9E - 1E = 8E).\n    *   **Excitation C:** Promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 gives a total energy of $2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$. (The energy cost is ΔE = E₄ - E₂ = 16E - 4E = 12E).\n\n*   By ranking the total system energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 22E, ...}, we see the three lowest energies are 10E, 15E, and 18E.\n\n**Final Calculated Energies:**\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the unanimous reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System's Fundamental Properties**\n\n*   **Particle Type:** The system consists of four identical **spin-1/2 particles**. A fundamental concept in quantum mechanics is that particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are classified as **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Principle:** As identical fermions, these particles are subject to the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Definition of a Quantum State:** For this system, a particle's complete quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the particle's energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n*   **Careful Point #1: Level Occupancy.** The most critical step is applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle correctly. Since a particle's state includes both energy (`n`) and spin (`m_s`), two particles *can* share the same energy level `n` as long as their spins are opposite (one spin-up, one spin-down). Therefore, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles.\n\n**2. Define the Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   The energy of a single particle in the *n*-th level of a 1D infinite potential well is $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   Therefore, the energy levels simplify to $E_n = n^2 E$. The first few are:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n**3. Calculate the Ground State Energy (Lowest Energy)**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We find this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the occupancy limit of two particles per level.\n\n*   Place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (Next-Lowest Energy)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by making the \"cheapest\" possible energy promotion.\n\n*   Starting from the ground state {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}, the smallest energy jump involves moving one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (Third-Lowest Energy)**\n\n*   **Careful Point #2: Systematic Search.** We must find the configuration with the *next lowest* energy after the first excited state. It is not necessarily the next-simplest excitation; we must compare the total energies of different possibilities.\n*   **Possibility A (First Excited State):** Promoting a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Total Energy = **15E**.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promoting a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   New Configuration: {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n    *   Total Energy: $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promoting a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   New Configuration: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n    *   Total Energy: $(2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**$.\n*   By comparing the total energies (10E, 15E, 18E, 22E...), we can see the third-lowest energy value corresponds to the second excited state.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated energies for the three lowest states of the system are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
