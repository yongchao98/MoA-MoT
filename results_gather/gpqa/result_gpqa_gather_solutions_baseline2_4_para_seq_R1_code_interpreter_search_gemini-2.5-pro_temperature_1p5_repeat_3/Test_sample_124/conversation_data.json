This potential describes a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" signifies that the potential is spherically symmetric, and thus the angular frequency of oscillation, $\\omega$, is the same in all three dimensions.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:\n        $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   Here, $n$ is the principal quantum number, defined as the sum of the quantum numbers for each Cartesian dimension: $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State**\n    *   The energy levels are enumerated by the quantum number $n$. We must correctly identify which value of $n$ corresponds to the \"third excited state\". The ground state is the lowest energy level.\n    *   **Ground State:** Corresponds to the lowest possible quantum number, $n=0$. Energy is $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=1$. Energy is $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=2$. Energy is $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=3$. Energy is $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The energy of the third excited state is therefore **$(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Eigenfunctions (Degeneracy)**\n    *   The degeneracy is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we must find the number of unique combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3.\n    *   This can be calculated using a general formula or by direct enumeration.\n        *   **Method 1 (Formula):** The degeneracy, $g_n$, for the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$. For $n=3$, this gives $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n        *   **Method 2 (Enumeration):** We list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n            *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) → 3 states\n            *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) → 6 states\n            *   The single combination (1, 1, 1) → 1 state\n            The total degeneracy is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    *   Both methods confirm there are **10** linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: System Identification.** It is critical to recognize the potential as a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The options C and D list an energy formula containing $\\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, which is characteristic of a particle in an infinite spherical potential well. This is a different physical system, so these options are fundamentally incorrect distractors.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Correct State Identification.** A common error is miscounting the excited states (an \"off-by-one\" error). The ground state is $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" is the third level *above* the ground state, which corresponds to the quantum number $n=3$.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Correct Degeneracy Calculation.** The degeneracy must be calculated for the correct quantum number, $n=3$. A degeneracy of 3 (as seen in option A) is the correct value for the *first* excited state ($n=1$), but not the third. This is a common distractor.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that for the third excited state:\n*   The energy is **$(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$**.\n*   The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is **10**.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nB) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nD) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n\nThe calculated values match option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating a synthesis of the candidate answers and highlighting crucial points for accuracy.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Physical System and its Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the standard potential for a **three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator**.\n\nThe Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$.

For the third excited state ($n=3$), we need to find the number of unique combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that satisfy the condition $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\nThis can be calculated using two common methods:\n\n*   **Method 1: Direct Enumeration**\n    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) → **3 states**\n    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) → **6 states**\n    *   The single combination (1, 1, 1): → **1 state**\n    *   Total number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = **10**.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the General Formula**\n    *   The degeneracy, $g_n$, for the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n        $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    *   For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nBoth methods confirm that there are **10** linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Potential and Energy Formula**: It is crucial to recognize that the potential $V \\propto r^2$ corresponds to a harmonic oscillator. The options A and B in the prompt list an energy formula ($ \\propto \\hbar^2 / (2mr^2)$) characteristic of a different system (an infinite spherical potential well) and are thus fundamentally incorrect.\n2.  **Correct Identification of the Excited State**: The ground state is $n=0$. A common mistake is an \"off-by-one\" error; the \"third excited state\" is the fourth energy level overall and corresponds to $n=3$, not $n=2$.\n3.  **Correct Calculation of Degeneracy**: The degeneracy must be calculated for the correct quantum number, $n=3$.

Identify the Physical System and its Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe problem specifies a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the standard potential for a **three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator**.\n\nThe Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates, meaning its total energy is the sum of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators. The energy levels are given by the formula:\n\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nHere, $n$ is the principal quantum number, defined as the sum of the quantum numbers for each dimension: $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z$ can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...), the principal quantum number $n$ can also be any non-negative integer.\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe energy levels are ordered by increasing values of $n$.

Calculate the Number of Linearly Independent Eigenfunctions (Degeneracy)**\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is its degeneracy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n\n*   **Method 1: Direct Enumeration**\n    List the combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ and their unique permutations:\n    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) → **3 states**\n    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) → **6 states**\n    *   The single combination (1, 1, 1): → **1 state**\n    The total degeneracy is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the Degeneracy Formula**\n    The degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator has a well-known formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, we substitute $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nBoth methods confirm that there are **10** linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **System Identification:** It is critical to recognize the potential as a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator and use the correct energy formula. The energy expressions in options B and D ($11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$) are for a particle in an infinite spherical well, a different physical system. These are distractors and should be eliminated immediately.\n*   **State Counting:** A common \"off-by-one\" error is to misidentify the excited state.

This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system can be derived by separating the Schrödinger equation in Cartesian coordinates.

It is critical to correctly identify which value of $n$ corresponds to the \"third excited state\".\n    *   **Ground State:** The lowest energy level, which corresponds to $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** The next level up, corresponding to $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The value of the energy for the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Linearly Independent Eigenfunctions (Degeneracy)**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (eigenfunctions) that share the same energy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we must find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3. This can be done by direct enumeration or by a formula.\n    *   **By Enumeration:**\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) → 3 states\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) → 6 states\n        *   The single combination (1, 1, 1) → 1 state\n        *   The total degeneracy is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    *   **By Formula:** The general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$. For $n=3$:\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n    Both methods confirm that there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **System Identification:** It is critical to recognize the potential as a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator and not confuse it with other systems. The energy expressions in options B and D, $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, are characteristic of a particle in an infinite spherical well. These are distractors.\n*   **Excited State Counting:** A frequent \"off-by-one\" error is misidentifying the excited state. The ground state corresponds to $n=0$, so the **third** excited state is the third level *above* the ground state, which corresponds to $n=3$, not $n=2$.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy must be calculated for the correct quantum number, $n=3$. A degeneracy of 3 (as seen in option C) corresponds to the *first* excited state ($n=1$), not the third, and is included as a common distractor.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the third excited state has an energy of **(9/2)ħω** and a degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) of **10**.

Calculate the Number of Eigenfunctions (Degeneracy)**\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is its degeneracy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we need to find the number of unique combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that satisfy the condition $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.

This potential describes a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" signifies that the potential is spherically symmetric, and thus the angular frequency of oscillation, $\\omega$, is the same in all three dimensions.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:\n        $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   Here, $n$ is the principal quantum number, defined as the sum of the quantum numbers for each Cartesian dimension: $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State**\n    *   The energy levels are enumerated by the quantum number $n$. We must correctly identify which value of $n$ corresponds to the \"third excited state\". The ground state is the lowest energy level.\n    *   **Ground State:** Corresponds to the lowest possible quantum number, $n=0$. Energy is $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=1$. Energy is $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=2$. Energy is $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=3$. Energy is $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The energy of the third excited state is therefore **$(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Eigenfunctions (Degeneracy)**\n    *   The degeneracy is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we must find the number of unique combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3.\n    *   This can be calculated using a general formula or by direct enumeration.\n        *   **Method 1 (Formula):** The degeneracy, $g_n$, for the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$. For $n=3$, this gives $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n        *   **Method 2 (Enumeration):** We list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n            *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) → 3 states\n            *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) → 6 states\n            *   The single combination (1, 1, 1) → 1 state\n            The total degeneracy is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    *   Both methods confirm there are **10** linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: System Identification.** It is critical to recognize the potential as a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The options C and D list an energy formula containing $\\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, which is characteristic of a particle in an infinite spherical potential well. This is a different physical system, so these options are fundamentally incorrect distractors.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Correct State Identification.** A common error is miscounting the excited states (an \"off-by-one\" error). The ground state is $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" is the third level *above* the ground state, which corresponds to the quantum number $n=3$.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Correct Degeneracy Calculation.** The degeneracy must be calculated for the correct quantum number, $n=3$. A degeneracy of 3 (as seen in option A) is the correct value for the *first* excited state ($n=1$), but not the third. This is a common distractor.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that for the third excited state:\n*   The energy is **$(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$**.\n*   The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is **10**.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nB) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nD) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n\nThe calculated values match option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating a synthesis of the candidate answers and highlighting crucial points for accuracy.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Physical System and its Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$.

Calculate the Number of Eigenfunctions (Degeneracy)**\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is its degeneracy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we need to find the number of unique combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that satisfy the condition $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.

Options with the correct energy but incorrect degeneracy (like option A, which has the degeneracy of the *first* excited state) are common distractors.\n*   **Candidate Answer Consistency:** The candidate answers provided all arrive at the same physical quantities (energy = $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, degeneracy = 10). Their different final letter choices (A, B, C, D) strongly suggest they were presented with different permutations of the options. Therefore, one must rely on their own analysis to match the calculated values to the specific option list provided in the prompt.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
