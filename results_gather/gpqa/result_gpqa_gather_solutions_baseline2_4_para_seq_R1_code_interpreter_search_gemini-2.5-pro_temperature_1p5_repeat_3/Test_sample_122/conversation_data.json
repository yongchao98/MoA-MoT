All agents correctly identify this as a problem of special relativity requiring the application of time dilation. They unanimously calculate the distance to be approximately `3,061,862 km`. The only discrepancies lie in the final lettered choice (A, B, C, or D), which is an artifact of how the options were listed in each agent's environment and should be disregarded. The core logic and numerical result are consistent throughout.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe ejecta is moving at `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's velocity is `v/c = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. At such a high velocity, the effects described by Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity are significant and classical physics is no longer accurate. The key principle here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Perform a Logical Sanity Check (Qualitative Analysis)**\nThis crucial step can often solve the problem without complex calculation.\n*   First, calculate the non-relativistic (classical) distance, which would be `distance = velocity × time`.\n    `Classical Distance = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    This corresponds to option **D**.\n*   The principle of time dilation states that from a stationary observer's perspective (the Galaxy), a moving clock (the ejecta's clock) runs slower. This means that for 50 seconds to pass in the ejecta's frame, a *longer* time must have passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n*   Since the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = velocity × (time in Galaxy's frame)`, and the time in the Galaxy's frame is *greater than 50 seconds*, the resulting distance must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n*   Looking at the options:\n    *   A) 2 940 000 km (less than 3,000,000 km)\n    *   B) 3 060 000 km (**greater than 3,000,000 km**)\n    *   C) 2 880 000 km (less than 3,000,000 km)\n    *   D) 3 000 000 km (the incorrect classical answer)\n*   This logical check alone is sufficient to conclude that **B** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm the logical conclusion, we perform the full relativistic calculation.\n*   The time given, `Δt' = 50 s`, is the **proper time** (time measured in the moving frame).\n*   The time measured in the stationary Galaxy frame, `Δt`, is found using the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n*   The distance in the Galaxy frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n*   Combining these gives the final formula:\n    `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n*   Plugging in the values:\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 4: Conclude by Comparing with Options**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options from the original question:\n*   A) 2 940 000 km\n*   B) 3 060 000 km\n*   C) 2 880 000 km\n*   D) 3 000 000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **Proper Time vs. Dilated Time**: It is essential to correctly identify the given `50 s` as the proper time (`Δt'`) because it's measured in the moving object's frame. The distance is asked for in the stationary frame, which experiences dilated time (`Δt`).\n2.  **Relativity increases the result**: Time dilation leads to a *longer* time measurement in the stationary frame, thus a *longer* distance compared to a classical calculation. Any answer smaller than the classical result is immediately incorrect.\n3.  **Classical Answer as a Distractor**: Multiple-choice questions in relativity often include the classical result (`3,000,000 km`) as a distractor option (option D).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires an application of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, as the velocity involved is a significant fraction of the speed of light. An analysis of the candidate answers shows a unanimous consensus on the physics, the required formula, and the final numerical result. The only variance among the agents was the letter corresponding to the correct answer, which indicates they were working from differently ordered lists of options.\n\nHere is a consolidated step-by-step analysis to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The ejecta is moving at `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% the speed of light. At such speeds, classical physics is inaccurate, and we must apply the principles of Special Relativity. The key concept here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We need to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The time given, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time.\"\n    *   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time interval for the same event as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**:\n    The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the Galaxy's frame:\n    `d = v × Δt`\n\n    According to the principle of time dilation, the time `Δt` is longer than the proper time `Δt₀` by a factor of `γ` (the Lorentz factor):\n    `Δt = γ × Δt₀`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    Combining these formulas gives the direct expression for the distance:\n    `d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    *   `v = 60,000` km/s\n    *   `Δt₀ = 50` s\n    *   `c = 300,000` km/s\n\n    `d = (60,000 × 50) / √(1 - (60,000 / 300,000)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.979796`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n4.  **Compare the Result with Options**:\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. We compare this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\n    The calculated value is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points and Common Pitfalls\n\n1.  **Recognizing the Need for Relativity**: The most crucial first step is to see that the speed is 20% of the speed of light, making a classical calculation invalid. A classical calculation (`60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`) yields option A, which is a common trap.\n\n2.  **Correctly Identifying Proper Time**: The given `50 s` is measured in the moving object's frame, making it the proper time (`Δt₀`). A common mistake is to misidentify which time is which.\n\n3.  **Using a Sanity Check**: One can often solve this type of problem through logic alone. Time dilation means that the time elapsed in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is *longer* than the proper time (`Δt₀`). Therefore, the distance measured in the stationary frame (`d = v × Δt`) must be *greater* than the classical distance (`v × Δt₀ = 3,000,000 km`). Looking at the options, only B) 3,060,000 km is greater than 3,000,000 km. This qualitative check confirms the calculation.\n\n4.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction**: It is important to apply the correct relativistic effect. This problem gives a proper time and asks for a distance, which is a `velocity × dilated_time` problem. It is not about observing the contraction of a physical length.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires the application of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. An analysis of the provided answers reveals a unanimous agreement on the underlying physics, the correct formula, and the resulting numerical answer. The discrepancy in the final letter choices among the candidate answers is due to inconsistent ordering of the multiple-choice options in their respective analyses, not a disagreement on the correct value. The following is a definitive, consolidated analysis.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. This is a significant fraction of the speed of light, c (approximately 300,000 km/s), with the ratio `v/c = 0.2`. At such speeds, classical physics is inadequate, and we must apply the principles of Special Relativity. The key concept required here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt'`)**: The given time, `50 s`, is measured in the ejecta's moving frame. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest relative to the events it is timing (the start and end of its own 50-second interval).\n    *   **Dilated Time (`Δt`)**: The time interval corresponding to the 50s of proper time, but as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n3.  **Qualitative Analysis (Sanity Check)**: Before performing complex calculations, a logical check can often identify the correct answer.\n    *   **Classical Calculation**: First, calculate the distance if we were to ignore relativistic effects:\n        `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option **B**.\n    *   **Relativistic Effect**: The theory of time dilation states that a moving clock runs slower from the perspective of a stationary observer. This means that for 50 seconds to pass in the ejecta's frame, a *longer* time interval (`Δt > 50s`) must pass in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   **Logical Conclusion**: The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `Δt > 50s`, the distance `d` *must* be greater than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n    *   **Reviewing the Options**:\n        A) 2 880 000 km. (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n        B) 3 000 000 km. (Incorrect, this is the classical distance)\n        C) 2 940 000 km. (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n        D) 3 060 000 km. (**Correct**, this is the only option greater than the classical distance)\n    This logical check alone is sufficient to determine the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Quantitative Calculation**: To confirm the result, we perform the full relativistic calculation.\n    *   The distance in the stationary frame is `d = v × Δt`.\n    *   The dilated time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt'` by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n        `Δt = γ × Δt'`\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining these gives the formula for the distance:\n        `d = (v × Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   Plugging in the known values:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s × 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 `\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Final Decision**: The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, the value is closest to **3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from our qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Identifying Proper Time**: The most critical step is to correctly identify the given time (50 s) as the \"proper time\" (`Δt'`) because it is measured in the rest frame of the moving clock (the ejecta). A common mistake is to confuse proper time with the time measured by the stationary observer.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction**: This problem is best solved with time dilation. We are given the time in the moving frame and asked for a distance in the stationary frame. This requires calculating the time elapsed in the stationary frame. Applying length contraction would be a more convoluted way to solve this specific problem setup.\n*   **The Power of the Sanity Check**: As demonstrated in Step 3, for many multiple-choice relativity problems, understanding the *direction* of the effect (does time get longer or shorter? does length get longer or shorter?) is often sufficient to eliminate all incorrect options without a full calculation. In this case, knowing the distance must be *greater* than the classical calculation was enough.\n*   **Rounding in Options**: The calculated answer (~3,061,862 km) is not identical to the option (3,060,000 km). It is crucial to recognize that options in such questions are often rounded values and to select the one that is closest to the precise calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the careful points required to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: All candidate answers correctly identify that this problem belongs to the domain of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. The velocity of the ejecta (`v = 60,000 km/s`) is 20% of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`). At such high speeds, classical physics is inaccurate. The specific relativistic phenomenon required to solve the problem is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**: It is essential to correctly define the two frames and the variables associated with them.\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame. The time elapsed in this frame is the dilated time, `Δt`.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The ejecta's reference frame. The given time, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within this frame. This is the **proper time (`Δt' or Δt₀`)**.\n    *   **Given values**: `v = 60,000 km/s`, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n3.  **Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**: This is a powerful step that most of the candidate answers rightly used. It allows for solving the problem by logic alone.\n    *   First, calculate the distance as if relativity didn't exist (a classical calculation): `d_classical = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option **A** in the problem statement.\n    *   According to time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more quickly than it does for the moving object. Therefore, the time `Δt` measured in the Galaxy's frame must be *longer* than the `50 s` proper time (`Δt > 50 s`).\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the relativistic distance `d` must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n    *   Examining the original options:\n        *   A) 3 000 000 km\n        *   B) 3 060 000 km\n        *   C) 2 880 000 km\n        *   D) 2 940 000 km\n    *   Only option **B** is greater than 3,000,000 km. This sanity check is sufficient to identify the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Perform the Full Quantitative Calculation**: To confirm the sanity check, we perform the exact calculation.\n    *   The distance in the stationary frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   The time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor, `γ`: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is given by `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining these gives the final formula for the distance: `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 `\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativity vs. Classical Physics**: The most crucial first step is recognizing that the speed is a significant fraction of `c`, mandating the use of special relativity. Using classical physics leads to the incorrect answer `3,000,000 km`.\n*   **Proper Time Identification**: A common mistake in relativity problems is misidentifying the proper time. The proper time (`Δt₀`) is always the time measured in the frame that is at rest relative to the events being measured (in this case, the clock on the ejecta). The time given, `50 s`, is the proper time.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction**: One must use the correct relativistic effect. Since the problem provides proper time and asks for distance in the stationary frame, the correct approach is to first find the dilated time in the stationary frame. While length contraction is a real effect, applying it here would require a different setup (e.g., being given the distance in the moving frame).\n*   **Interpreting Agent Discrepancies**: The candidate answers showed universal agreement on the physics and the numerical result (~3,062,000 km). The discrepancy in their final letter choice (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) was solely due to their internal systems processing the options in different orders. The core reasoning and result were identical and correct across all agents.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, there is a unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the formulas to be used, and the final numerical result. The minor discrepancies in the letter choices of the answers are due to their internal processing of the multiple-choice options, not any error in the physics or math. Here is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The problem involves an object (the supernova ejecta) moving at `v = 60,000 km/s`. This speed is 20% of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`), making relativistic effects significant. The question compares time and distance between two different inertial reference frames (the ejecta and the Galaxy). This is a classic problem requiring Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key principle is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. A clock in this frame measures the time passed.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt'` or `Δt₀`):** The given time, `50 s`, is measured in the ejecta's moving frame. This is the \"proper time.\"\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** 60,000 km/s.\n    *   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time interval for the same event as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's stationary frame.\n\n3.  **Perform a Qualitative Sanity Check (Logical Elimination):**\n    This is a powerful method used by nearly all the agents to quickly narrow down the possibilities.\n    *   First, calculate the classical distance (ignoring relativity) as a baseline:\n        `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km.`\n        This value corresponds to option **B**.\n    *   The principle of time dilation states that a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta) appears to run slower to an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy). Therefore, for 50 seconds to pass for the ejecta, *more* than 50 seconds must pass in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt > 50 s`).\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `Δt` is greater than 50 s, the distance `d` must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        A) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n        B) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect, this is the classical distance)\n        C) 3 060 000 km (**Correct, this is the only option greater than the classical distance**)\n        D) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n    *   This sanity check alone is sufficient to confidently select the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Perform the Quantitative Calculation (for Confirmation):**\n    To confirm our logical check, we perform the full calculation. The distance `d` is given by the formula:\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    *   The numerator `(v * Δt₀)` is the classical distance: `3,000,000 km`.\n    *   The denominator is the Lorentz factor correction:\n        `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`\n    *   Calculate the result:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Final Decision:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **C) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Proper Time:** The most critical step is to correctly identify that the given `50 s` is the proper time (`Δt₀`), as it's measured in the moving object's own frame of reference.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem is about the passage of time being different between frames, leading to a different calculated distance over that time. It is a time dilation problem. Length contraction would be relevant if we were asked, for instance, about the distance to the Galactic center as measured *by an observer on the ejecta*.\n*   **The Power of the Sanity Check:** In multiple-choice questions involving relativity, first calculating the classical answer and then reasoning whether the relativistic answer should be larger or smaller is an extremely effective strategy for both solving the problem and catching potential calculation errors.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity.

The key phenomenon at play here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame. The time elapsed in this frame is the dilated time, `Δt`.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. The given time of 50 seconds passes in this frame. This is the **proper time (`Δt₀`)**.\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n        *   `Δt₀ = 50 s`\n        *   `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`\n\n3.  **Perform a Qualitative Sanity Check (The most intuitive way to solve):**\n    *   First, calculate what the distance would be if we incorrectly ignored relativity (a classical calculation):\n        `d_classical = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km.`\n        This value corresponds to option **C** in the provided list.\n    *   Next, apply the principle of time dilation. Time dilation states that a clock in a moving frame (the ejecta) will appear to run slower from the perspective of a stationary frame (the Galaxy). This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta (`Δt₀`), a **longer** period of time (`Δt`) will have passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`. Since we know `Δt > 50 s`, the actual distance `d` *must be greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n    *   Looking at the original options:\n        *   A) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n        *   B) 3 060 000 km (**Plausible**, greater than the classical distance)\n        *   C) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect, this is the classical distance itself)\n        *   D) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n    *   This logical check alone is sufficient to determine that **B** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n4.  **Perform the Quantitative Calculation (To confirm):**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame is calculated using the time `Δt` measured in that frame: `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   First, we must find the dilated time `Δt` from the proper time `Δt₀` using the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   We can combine these to find the distance directly:\n        `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n    *   Plugging in the numbers:\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.04) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) `\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from the sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Proper Time:** The most common mistake in these problems is misidentifying the proper time. Proper time (`Δt₀`) is *always* the time measured by a clock in the same reference frame as the event being observed (i.e., the clock is at rest relative to the event). Here, the 50 seconds is measured by a clock on the ejecta, making it the proper time.\n*   **Time Dilation Implication:** A core concept to remember is that dilated time (`Δt`, measured by the stationary observer) is always *longer* than proper time (`Δt₀`) when there is relative motion. This means the relativistic distance measured in the stationary frame will be *greater* than the classical distance `v * Δt₀`.\n*   **Consensus of Agents:** All candidate answers correctly identified the physics and performed the calculation to arrive at the same numerical result (`≈ 3,062,000 km`). The confusion in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) arose from processing the list of options in different orders, not from any error in the physics or math.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the provided answers from the agents, a consensus on the physics, methodology, and numerical result is clear. Here is a consolidated step-by-step analysis, followed by a list of careful points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves an object (the supernova ejecta) moving at a velocity of 60,000 km/s. The speed of light (`c`) is approximately 300,000 km/s, so the ejecta's velocity is `v = 0.2c`. Since this speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, classical Newtonian physics is inadequate. This problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key phenomenon is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from this frame. Let's call this distance `d`.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. A clock in this frame measures the elapsed time as `50 s`. This is the **proper time (`Δt₀`)**, as it is measured in the object's own rest frame.\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time that passes in the stationary frame (the Galaxy). Due to time dilation, this will be longer than the proper time.\n\n**Step 3: The Calculation**\nThe distance traveled as measured in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula `d = v × Δt`. To find `d`, we must first find the dilated time `Δt`.\n\n1.  **Time Dilation Formula:** The dilated time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n2.  **Combined Distance Formula:** We can substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n3.  **Plug in the numbers:**\n    *   `v = 60,000` km/s\n    *   `Δt₀ = 50` s\n    *   `c = 300,000` km/s\n    *   Numerator: `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This is the classical distance.\n    *   Denominator: `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n    *   Final Calculation: `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with Options and Conclude**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options:\n*   A) 2 880 000 km\n*   B) 3 000 000 km\n*   C) 3 060 000 km\n*   D) 2 940 000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Proper Time vs. Dilated Time:** The most critical step is correctly identifying the given 50 seconds as the *proper time* (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the moving frame of the ejecta. A common mistake is to use this time directly in the classical formula `d=v*t`. One must \"dilate\" this time to what an observer in the Galaxy's stationary frame would measure before calculating the distance in that frame.\n\n2.  **Qualitative Sanity Check:** As all the agents noted, a powerful way to approach this problem is with a logical check before calculating. The principle of time dilation means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is *longer* than 50 seconds. Therefore, the distance traveled must be *greater* than the classical distance of `60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. Reviewing the options, only `3,060,000 km` is greater than `3,000,000 km`. This sanity check allows for solving the problem with high confidence without needing a calculator.\n\n3.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** It's important to use the correct relativistic effect. Since the problem provides a time measurement in one frame and asks for a distance in another, time dilation is the relevant concept. We find the time elapsed in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and then use `d = v * Δt`. The concept of length contraction would be relevant if, for example, we were given the length of an object in its own rest frame and asked for its apparent length as it moved past us.\n\n4.  **Consistency Among Agents:** An analysis of all 15 candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principle, the correct formula, and the final numerical result. The different letter choices (A, B, C, D) are merely an artifact of how the options were listed in their respective systems. The universal agreement on the value `~3,060,000 km` provides the highest possible confidence in the result.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the underlying physics and the necessary calculations. The variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the agents is due to inconsistent ordering of the options in their individual problem statements, not due to any disagreement on the correct numerical result. Every agent that performed the calculation correctly arrived at a value of approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle\n\nThe supernova ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, classical Newtonian mechanics is insufficient. The problem must be solved using the principles of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, specifically the phenomenon of **time dilation**.\n\n### Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables\n\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt'`):** The time interval `50 s` is measured in the ejecta's frame. Since it is measured by a clock moving along with the subject, it is the \"proper time\". So, `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** `60,000 km/s`.\n\n### Step 3: Qualitative Sanity Check\n\nThis is a crucial step that can often solve the problem without complex calculation.\n1.  First, calculate the **classical distance** (i.e., ignoring relativity). This gives a baseline for comparison.\n    `d_classical = v × Δt' = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n2.  According to **time dilation**, a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta) is observed to tick slower than a clock in the stationary frame (the Galaxy). This means that for 50 seconds to pass for the ejecta, a **longer time** must have passed in the Galaxy's frame. Let's call this longer time `Δt`. So, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  The distance we need to find is the one measured in the Galaxy's frame, which is `d = v × Δt`. Since `Δt` is greater than 50 s, the resulting distance `d` **must be greater** than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  Let's examine the options based on this insight:\n    *   A) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km -> Incorrect)\n    *   B) 3 060 000 km (Greater than 3,000,000 km -> Plausible)\n    *   C) 3 000 000 km (The classical result -> Incorrect)\n    *   D) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km -> Incorrect)\n    \nThis logical check alone is sufficient to identify **B** as the only possible correct answer.\n\n### Step 4: Quantitative Calculation for Verification\n\nTo confirm the sanity check, we perform the full relativistic calculation. The dilated time (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n\n`Δt = γ × Δt'` where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nThe distance in the stationary frame is `d = v × Δt`. Combining these formulas gives:\n\n`d = (v × Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n*   Numerator (classical distance): `60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n*   Denominator: `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`\n\nSo, `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\nThe calculated distance of **3,061,862 km** is closest to option **B) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic:** The most common mistake is to perform a simple classical calculation (`d=v*t`), which yields 3,000,000 km (Option C). The speed of 0.2c is a clear indicator that relativity is required.\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** It is essential to correctly identify the given `50 s` as the proper time (`Δt'`) because it is measured in the moving object's own frame.\n3.  **Time Dilation, Not Length Contraction:** The problem is about a duration measured in one frame being used to calculate a distance in another frame, which directly involves time dilation. Length contraction is a different effect related to measuring the length of a moving object.\n4.  **Direction of the Effect:** Time *dilation* means the time measured in the stationary frame is *longer*, which in turn means the distance measured is *greater* than the classical distance. This provides the basis for the powerful sanity check.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, there is a strong consensus on the physics and calculation required. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to differing option lists, but the numerical result is consistent. Here is a definitive step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves an object, the supernova ejecta, moving at a very high velocity (`v = 60,000 km/s`). This speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`), specifically 20% (`v = 0.2c`). When comparing measurements between different inertial frames of reference at such speeds, classical physics is insufficient. This problem requires the application of **Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity**, and the key phenomenon at play is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. A clock in this frame measures the time interval.\n*   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt'`):** The time given, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time.\"\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative Sanity Check**\nBefore performing the full calculation, we can use logic to eliminate incorrect options.\n1.  **Classical Calculation (Non-Relativistic):** If we were to ignore relativity, the distance would be a simple multiplication: `distance = velocity × time`.\n    `d_classical = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This value matches option C.\n2.  **Relativistic Effect (Time Dilation):** The theory of time dilation states that an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt' = 50 s`) measured in the moving frame (the ejecta). So, for the observer in the Galaxy, *more* than 50 seconds have passed.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the resulting distance `d` must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n4.  **Checking the Options:**\n    *   **A) 3 060 000 km** (Greater than 3,000,000 km - Plausible)\n    *   B) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km - Incorrect)\n    *   C) 3 000 000 km (The classical result - Incorrect)\n    *   D) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km - Incorrect)\n\nThis logical sanity check is powerful enough to determine that **A** is the only possible correct answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm our reasoning, we perform the precise calculation. The dilated time (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`). The distance is `d = v × Δt`.\n\nThe combined formula for the distance is:\n`d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n*   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n*   `Δt' = 50 s`\n*   `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`\n\n`d = (60,000 × 50) / √(1 - (60,000 / 300,000)²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.04) `\n`d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 `\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 `\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Compare and Conclude**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. We compare this with the given options:\n*   A) 3 060 000 km\n*   B) 2 940 000 km\n*   C) 3 000 000 km\n*   D) 2 880 000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from our qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Identifying Proper Time:** The most critical step is correctly identifying that the `50 s` time interval is the **proper time** (`Δt'`) because it's measured by a clock in the same reference frame as the event's duration (i.e., moving with the ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation, Not Length Contraction:** The problem is solved most directly by considering how time is measured differently between the frames. While length contraction is another relativistic effect, calculating the dilated time is the direct path to the answer.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Result:** A key takeaway from time dilation is that the time measured by the stationary observer is always longer. Consequently, the distance calculated (`d = v × Δt`) in the stationary frame will be greater than the classical distance calculated using proper time (`d = v × Δt'`). This provides the basis for the sanity check.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, there is a universal consensus on the physical principles, the required formulas, and the final numerical result.

The disagreement on the final letter (A, B, C, or D) is merely an artifact of their different internal representations of the options list.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, all agents correctly identified the physics and performed the necessary calculations. The variance in their final letter choice is due to inconsistent ordering of the multiple-choice options in their respective environments. The following is a definitive step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle\nThe problem involves an object, the supernova ejecta, moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's speed as a fraction of the speed of light is `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of `c`. Since this speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, the principles of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity must be used. The key phenomenon in this problem is **time dilation**.\n\n### Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀` or `Δt'`):** The time measured in the moving frame is `50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is at rest relative to the events it is timing (i.e., the clock is on the ejecta). So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time interval measured in the stationary Galaxy frame. According to relativity, this will be longer than the proper time.\n*   **Distance in Stationary Frame (`d`):** This is the value we need to calculate using the formula `d = v × Δt`.\n\n### Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"\nBefore doing any complex math, we can use logic to eliminate incorrect options.\n1.  **Calculate the classical distance:** If we ignored relativity, the distance would be simply `distance = velocity × time`. Using the time from the ejecta's frame, we get:\n    `d_classical = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n    This classical result corresponds to **Option A**.\n2.  **Apply the principle of time dilation:** Time dilation states that a clock moving relative to an observer will be measured to tick slower. This means that while 50 seconds (`Δt₀`) pass for the ejecta, a longer time interval (`Δt`) will have passed in the Galaxy's frame. So, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  **Draw a logical conclusion:** Since the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`, and `Δt > 50 s`, the actual relativistic distance must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n4.  **Check the options:**\n    A) 3 000 000 km (The incorrect classical result)\n    B) 2 880 000 km (Less than the classical result)\n    C) 2 940 000 km (Less than the classical result)\n    D) 3 060 000 km (**The only plausible answer**, as it is greater than the classical result)\n\nThis sanity check is sufficient to confidently select the correct answer.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation\nTo confirm our reasoning, we will now calculate the precise distance.\n1.  The formula for the distance in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`.\n2.  The dilated time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `Δt = γ × Δt₀`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n3.  We can combine these into a single formula for distance:\n    `d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n4.  Now, we plug in the values:\n    `d = (60,000 km/s × 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.979796 `\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km `\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion and Careful Points\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.

The classical answer is present as a distractor (Option A).\n*   **Identifying the proper time:** It is critical to recognize that the given time of 50 s is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the moving object's frame. A common error is to mistake this for the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`).\n*   **Applying the correct effect:** This problem requires time dilation. The time for the event is measured as being longer in the stationary frame, leading to a greater distance travelled than in the classical case. An incorrect application could lead to a result smaller than the classical one (Options B and C).\n*   **Using the sanity check:** As shown in Step 3, simple logic can often solve relativity problems or, at the very least, eliminate all but one option, providing a check against calculation errors.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, here is a consolidated step-by-step breakdown of the problem and its solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem involves a supernova ejecta moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. This is 20% of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`), making relativistic effects significant. The question compares time and distance measurements between two inertial frames of reference (the ejecta and the Galaxy), which means this is a problem of Special Relativity. The key principle is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** `60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt'`):** The time of `50 s` is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time.\"\n\n3.  **Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\":**\n    *   First, calculate the classical distance (ignoring relativity) as a baseline. This would be `distance = velocity × time`.\n        `d_classical = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option D.\n    *   According to the theory of time dilation, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a *longer* time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt' = 50 s`) measured in the moving frame. Therefore, `Δt > 50 s`.\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `Δt` is greater than `50 s`, the distance `d` must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n    *   Reviewing the options:\n        A) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect)\n        B) 3 060 000 km (Plausible)\n        C) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect)\n        D) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect)\n    *   This logical check alone is sufficient to identify **B** as the only possible answer.\n\n4.  **Perform the Quantitative Calculation:**\n    To confirm the sanity check, we perform the full relativistic calculation. The distance is found using `d = v × Δt`. We first need to find the dilated time, `Δt`.\n    *   The formula for time dilation relates `Δt` to `Δt'` via the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining the formulas gives a direct expression for the distance:\n        `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Now, we substitute the values:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96) `\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 `\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**. This result is confirmed by both the logical sanity check and the precise calculation.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The most critical step is correctly identifying the `50 s` interval as the \"proper time\" (`Δt'`) because it's measured in the rest frame of the moving object (the ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation Implication:** A common misconception is to think time \"slows down\" in a way that reduces distances. However, from the stationary observer's perspective, the moving clock is slow, meaning more time passes on the stationary clock during the event. This leads to a *greater* measured distance `d = v × Δt`.\n*   **Sanity Check Power:** In multiple-choice questions involving relativity, a quick qualitative check is often sufficient. Knowing whether the final value should be greater or smaller than the classical value can quickly eliminate most incorrect options.\n*   **Consistency Among Agents:** All candidate answers correctly identified the physics and performed the calculation to arrive at the same numerical result. The variance in their final letter choice was an artifact of how they listed the options, but their conclusion on the correct *value* was unanimous.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers, here is a consolidated step-by-step reasoning and a list of careful points to consider for this problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nAll candidate answers correctly recognize that the ejecta's velocity (`v = 60,000 km/s`) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`). The ratio is `v/c = 0.2`. Therefore, this is not a problem of classical physics but one that requires Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. The key principle to be applied is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Key Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The reference frame of the Galaxy. The question asks for the distance (`d`) traveled by the ejecta as measured by an observer in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The reference frame of the ejecta.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt'):** The time interval of `50 s` is measured by a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta). This is known as the \"proper time\" because it is the time measured by a clock at rest relative to the event.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative Sanity Check**\nThis is a crucial step that many candidates correctly used to quickly narrow down the answer.\n1.  **Classical Calculation:** If we ignore relativity, the distance would be `distance = velocity × time`.\n    `d_classical = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    This corresponds to option **D**.\n2.  **Relativistic Effect:** The principle of time dilation states that an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt' = 50 s`) measured in the moving frame. Therefore, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The distance as measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `Δt` is greater than 50 s, the resulting distance `d` *must be greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Elimination:** Examining the options:\n    A) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km)\n    B) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km)\n    C) 3 060 000 km (Greater than 3,000,000 km)\n    D) 3 000 000 km (The classical result itself)\nThis logical check alone is sufficient to determine that **C** is the only plausible answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm the sanity check, we perform the full relativistic calculation. The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is `d = v * Δt`. The time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt'` by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\nThe complete formula is: `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n1.  Plug in the values:\n    *   `v * Δt' = 3,000,000 km`\n    *   `v²/c² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n2.  Calculate the distance:\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.04)`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this result with the provided options, it is closest to option **C) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly Identifying the Physics:** The most important step is recognizing that the speed is relativistic and that time dilation is the relevant principle, not classical mechanics.\n2.  **Correctly Identifying Proper Time:** It is essential to identify the given `50 s` as the proper time (`Δt'`) because it is measured in the object's own moving reference frame. A common mistake is to misidentify this as the observer's time.\n3.  **Using the Sanity Check:** The qualitative analysis is a powerful tool. By calculating the classical distance first, you can immediately determine whether the relativistic answer should be larger (time dilation) or smaller (length contraction). In this case, since distance is based on the observer's *dilated* time, it must be larger. This helps avoid calculation errors.\n4.  **Consistency Among Candidates:** All provided candidate answers correctly identified the physics, the formula, and performed the calculation to arrive at the same numerical result (`≈3,062,000 km`). The variation in their final letter choice (`A`, `B`, `C`, or `D`) is clearly due to them having the options listed in a different order, but their underlying analysis is unanimous and correct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the unanimous reasoning of the provided answers and highlighting careful points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves an object (the supernova ejecta) moving at a very high velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`. This is 20% of the speed of light (`c` ≈ 300,000 km/s), making `v = 0.2c`. When dealing with such speeds and comparing measurements between two different inertial frames of reference (the ejecta and the Galaxy), the principles of classical physics are no longer accurate. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key phenomenon is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** `60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The time of `50 s` is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time\" because it is the time interval measured by a clock at rest relative to the event it is timing.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Relativistic Calculation**\nThe distance measured in the Galaxy's frame (`d`) is the ejecta's velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n\n*   `d = v × Δt`\n\nDue to time dilation, the time measured in the stationary Galaxy frame (`Δt`) is longer than the proper time (`Δt₀`) measured in the moving ejecta's frame. The relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n\n*   `Δt = γ × Δt₀`\n*   where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\nCombining these formulas gives the direct calculation for the distance:\n\n*   `d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n1.  Calculate the \"classical\" distance (the numerator): `v × Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n2.  Calculate the Lorentz factor's denominator: `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n3.  Calculate the final distance: `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with Options and Conclude**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. We compare this to the options provided:\n*   A) 2 940 000 km\n*   B) 2 880 000 km\n*   C) 3 060 000 km\n*   D) 3 000 000 km\n\nThe calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The \"Sanity Check\" is Key:** Before any complex calculation, it's crucial to apply logic. The classical, non-relativistic distance would be `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option D). Because of time dilation, we know the time measured by the Galaxy observer is *longer* than 50 seconds. Therefore, the distance measured by the Galaxy observer must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km. This simple check immediately eliminates options A, B, and D, leaving only C as the plausible answer.\n\n2.  **Correctly Identifying \"Proper Time\"**: The most common error in these types of problems is confusing the two time measurements. The \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) is always the time measured by a clock that is at rest in the frame of reference being observed. Here, the `50 s` is measured by the ejecta's clock, making it the proper time.\n\n3.  **Time Dilation, not Length Contraction**: The problem gives a *time* in the moving frame and asks for a *distance* in the stationary frame. The correct path is to first dilate the time (`Δt = γΔt₀`) and then calculate the distance (`d = vΔt`). One might be tempted to use length contraction, but that would apply if, for example, we were given a proper length (e.g., the length of a spaceship at rest) and asked for its observed length as it flies by.\n\n4.  **Agent Consensus**: It is important to note that all 15 candidate answers, despite showing different final letter choices, were unanimous in their physical reasoning, mathematical formula, and calculated numerical result (~3,061,862 km). The discrepancy in the final letter is an artifact of the agents processing a scrambled list of options, but their core conclusion on the *value* is identical and correct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers, there is a clear consensus on the physical principles and the numerical calculation required. The variation in the final letter choices is due to different ordering of the options by the agents, but the underlying reasoning is unanimously correct.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem and Identify the Core Physical Principle\n\nThe problem describes an object, the supernova ejecta, moving at a very high velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light `c` is approximately `300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's speed is therefore `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this speed is a significant fraction of `c`, the laws of classical physics are insufficient. This is a problem in Einstein's **Special Theory of Relativity**, and the key concept required is **Time Dilation**.\n\n### Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables\n\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance `d` as measured in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** `60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀` or `Δt'`):** The time interval measured in the moving frame (`S'`) is given as `50 s`. This is called the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest within its own frame.\n\n### Step 3: Perform a Qualitative Sanity Check\n\nThis logical step can often solve the problem without a full calculation.\n1.  **Classical Calculation:** First, we calculate the distance as if relativity didn't exist:\n    `d_classical = v × Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This value matches option (B).\n2.  **Relativistic Effect:** The principle of time dilation states that a moving clock runs slower as observed by a stationary observer. This means that while 50 seconds (`Δt₀`) pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy will measure a *longer* time interval (`Δt`).\n3.  **Conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and we know `Δt > Δt₀`, the resulting distance `d` must be **greater than** the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Check the Options:**\n    A) 2 940 000 km (less than 3,000,000 km) -> Incorrect.\n    B) 3 000 000 km (the classical result) -> Incorrect.\n    C) 3 060 000 km (greater than 3,000,000 km) -> **Plausible**.\n    D) 2 880 000 km (less than 3,000,000 km) -> Incorrect.\nThis logical check alone is sufficient to determine that (C) must be the correct answer.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Full Quantitative Calculation\n\nTo confirm the result from the sanity check, we perform the exact calculation.\n1.  The formula for time dilation relates the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) to the proper time (`Δt₀`) using the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n2.  The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n3.  The distance in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Combining these formulas gives:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n4.  Now, plug in the values:\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.979796...`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated distance is **3,061,862 km**.

This confirms the result from our initial logical check.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Relativity vs. Classical Physics:** The key is to recognize that the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v=0.2c`), mandating the use of special relativity.\n2.  **Proper Time:** It is crucial to correctly identify the given `50 s` as the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's the time measured in the object's own moving frame.\n3.  **Time Dilation, Not Length Contraction:** The problem gives the time in the moving frame and asks for distance in the stationary frame. This requires calculating the dilated time (`Δt`) in the stationary frame first and then using `d = v × Δt`. One should not confuse this with length contraction, which concerns the measured length of a moving object.\n4.  **Direction of the Effect:** Time dilation always means the time interval measured by a stationary observer (`Δt`) is *longer* than the proper time (`Δt₀`). Therefore, the relativistic distance measured in the stationary frame will always be *greater* than the classical distance calculated using the proper time.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The minor discrepancies in the letter choices among the candidate answers are artifacts of how the multiple-choice options were ordered in their respective environments and do not reflect any disagreement on the physics.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe problem states that the supernova ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light is `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this speed is a significant fraction of `c`, the laws of classical mechanics are not accurate. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key phenomenon involved is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The reference frame of the Galaxy. The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The reference frame of the ejecta.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt'` or `Δt₀`):** The given time interval, `50 s`, is measured by a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time,\" as it's the time measured by a clock at rest relative to the events it is timing.\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** This is the corresponding time interval as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**\nThis is a powerful method for solving many relativity problems with logic, as highlighted by nearly all candidate answers.\n1.  **Calculate the Classical Distance:** First, find the distance if we were to incorrectly ignore relativistic effects:\n    `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to **Option A**.\n2.  **Apply the Time Dilation Principle:** The theory of time dilation states that a moving clock appears to run slower from the perspective of a stationary observer. This means that for 50 seconds (`Δt'`) to pass for the ejecta, a **longer** time interval (`Δt`) must have passed in the Galaxy's frame. So, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  **Draw the Logical Conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the actual distance `d` **must be greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n4.  **Review the Options:**\n    *   A) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect, this is the classical value)\n    *   B) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical value)\n    *   C) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical value)\n    *   D) 3 060 000 km (**Correct**, this is the only option greater than the classical value)\n\nThis sanity check alone is sufficient to confidently identify the correct answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm the logical result, we perform the full relativistic calculation.\n1.  The distance in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`.\n2.  We find the dilated time `Δt` using the proper time `Δt'` and the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n3.  Combining these formulas gives a single expression for the distance:\n    `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n4.  Plugging in the given values:\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.979796 `\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Compare and Finalize**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options, it is closest to **3,060,000 km**. This confirms the result from the sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Relativity vs. Classical Physics:** The most important initial step is to recognize that the speed (`v = 0.2c`) is relativistic, making the classical calculation (`d = v × t`) incorrect. The classical answer is often included as a distractor option.\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** Correctly identifying the given `50 s` as the **proper time** (`Δt'`) is critical. Proper time is the time interval measured in the frame where the clock is at rest. Misidentifying this is a common error in relativity problems.\n3.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem is solved by using time dilation. We are given a time interval in one frame and need to calculate a distance traveled in another. This requires finding the dilated time in the observer's frame (`Δt`) and then using `d = v × Δt`. Length contraction is a different phenomenon concerning the observed length of a moving object.\n4.  **The Power of the \"Sanity Check\":** For multiple-choice questions, understanding the *direction* of the relativistic effect is extremely useful. Knowing that dilated time is always longer than proper time immediately tells you that the distance measured in the stationary frame must be greater than the classical distance `v × Δt'`. This helps to quickly eliminate wrong answers and validate the final calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"

All agents correctly identify this as a problem of special relativity requiring the application of time dilation. They unanimously calculate the distance to be approximately `3,061,862 km`. The only discrepancies lie in the final lettered choice (A, B, C, or D), which is an artifact of how the options were listed in each agent's environment and should be disregarded. The core logic and numerical result are consistent throughout.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe ejecta is moving at `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's velocity is `v/c = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. At such a high velocity, the effects described by Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity are significant and classical physics is no longer accurate. The key principle here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Perform a Logical Sanity Check (Qualitative Analysis)**\nThis crucial step can often solve the problem without complex calculation.\n*   First, calculate the non-relativistic (classical) distance, which would be `distance = velocity × time`.\n    `Classical Distance = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    This corresponds to option **D**.\n*   The principle of time dilation states that from a stationary observer's perspective (the Galaxy), a moving clock (the ejecta's clock) runs slower. This means that for 50 seconds to pass in the ejecta's frame, a *longer* time must have passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n*   Since the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = velocity × (time in Galaxy's frame)`, and the time in the Galaxy's frame is *greater than 50 seconds*, the resulting distance must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n*   Looking at the options:\n    *   A) 2 940 000 km (less than 3,000,000 km)\n    *   B) 3 060 000 km (**greater than 3,000,000 km**)\n    *   C) 2 880 000 km (less than 3,000,000 km)\n    *   D) 3 000 000 km (the incorrect classical answer)\n*   This logical check alone is sufficient to conclude that **B** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm the logical conclusion, we perform the full relativistic calculation.\n*   The time given, `Δt' = 50 s`, is the **proper time** (time measured in the moving frame).\n*   The time measured in the stationary Galaxy frame, `Δt`, is found using the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n*   The distance in the Galaxy frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n*   Combining these gives the final formula:\n    `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n*   Plugging in the values:\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 4: Conclude by Comparing with Options**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options from the original question:\n*   A) 2 940 000 km\n*   B) 3 060 000 km\n*   C) 2 880 000 km\n*   D) 3 000 000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **Proper Time vs. Dilated Time**: It is essential to correctly identify the given `50 s` as the proper time (`Δt'`) because it's measured in the moving object's frame. The distance is asked for in the stationary frame, which experiences dilated time (`Δt`).\n2.  **Relativity increases the result**: Time dilation leads to a *longer* time measurement in the stationary frame, thus a *longer* distance compared to a classical calculation. Any answer smaller than the classical result is immediately incorrect.\n3.  **Classical Answer as a Distractor**: Multiple-choice questions in relativity often include the classical result (`3,000,000 km`) as a distractor option (option D).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires an application of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, as the velocity involved is a significant fraction of the speed of light. An analysis of the candidate answers shows a unanimous consensus on the physics, the required formula, and the final numerical result. The only variance among the agents was the letter corresponding to the correct answer, which indicates they were working from differently ordered lists of options.\n\nHere is a consolidated step-by-step analysis to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The ejecta is moving at `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% the speed of light. At such speeds, classical physics is inaccurate, and we must apply the principles of Special Relativity. The key concept here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We need to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The time given, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time.\"\n    *   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time interval for the same event as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**:\n    The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the Galaxy's frame:\n    `d = v × Δt`\n\n    According to the principle of time dilation, the time `Δt` is longer than the proper time `Δt₀` by a factor of `γ` (the Lorentz factor):\n    `Δt = γ × Δt₀`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    Combining these formulas gives the direct expression for the distance:\n    `d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    *   `v = 60,000` km/s\n    *   `Δt₀ = 50` s\n    *   `c = 300,000` km/s\n\n    `d = (60,000 × 50) / √(1 - (60,000 / 300,000)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.979796`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n4.  **Compare the Result with Options**:\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. We compare this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\n    The calculated value is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points and Common Pitfalls\n\n1.  **Recognizing the Need for Relativity**: The most crucial first step is to see that the speed is 20% of the speed of light, making a classical calculation invalid. A classical calculation (`60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`) yields option A, which is a common trap.\n\n2.  **Correctly Identifying Proper Time**: The given `50 s` is measured in the moving object's frame, making it the proper time (`Δt₀`). A common mistake is to misidentify which time is which.\n\n3.  **Using a Sanity Check**: One can often solve this type of problem through logic alone. Time dilation means that the time elapsed in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is *longer* than the proper time (`Δt₀`). Therefore, the distance measured in the stationary frame (`d = v × Δt`) must be *greater* than the classical distance (`v × Δt₀ = 3,000,000 km`). Looking at the options, only B) 3,060,000 km is greater than 3,000,000 km. This qualitative check confirms the calculation.\n\n4.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction**: It is important to apply the correct relativistic effect. This problem gives a proper time and asks for a distance, which is a `velocity × dilated_time` problem. It is not about observing the contraction of a physical length.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires the application of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. An analysis of the provided answers reveals a unanimous agreement on the underlying physics, the correct formula, and the resulting numerical answer. The discrepancy in the final letter choices among the candidate answers is due to inconsistent ordering of the multiple-choice options in their respective analyses, not a disagreement on the correct value. The following is a definitive, consolidated analysis.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. This is a significant fraction of the speed of light, c (approximately 300,000 km/s), with the ratio `v/c = 0.2`. At such speeds, classical physics is inadequate, and we must apply the principles of Special Relativity. The key concept required here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt'`)**: The given time, `50 s`, is measured in the ejecta's moving frame. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest relative to the events it is timing (the start and end of its own 50-second interval).\n    *   **Dilated Time (`Δt`)**: The time interval corresponding to the 50s of proper time, but as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n3.  **Qualitative Analysis (Sanity Check)**: Before performing complex calculations, a logical check can often identify the correct answer.\n    *   **Classical Calculation**: First, calculate the distance if we were to ignore relativistic effects:\n        `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option **B**.\n    *   **Relativistic Effect**: The theory of time dilation states that a moving clock runs slower from the perspective of a stationary observer. This means that for 50 seconds to pass in the ejecta's frame, a *longer* time interval (`Δt > 50s`) must pass in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   **Logical Conclusion**: The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `Δt > 50s`, the distance `d` *must* be greater than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n    *   **Reviewing the Options**:\n        A) 2 880 000 km. (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n        B) 3 000 000 km. (Incorrect, this is the classical distance)\n        C) 2 940 000 km. (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n        D) 3 060 000 km. (**Correct**, this is the only option greater than the classical distance)\n    This logical check alone is sufficient to determine the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Quantitative Calculation**: To confirm the result, we perform the full relativistic calculation.\n    *   The distance in the stationary frame is `d = v × Δt`.\n    *   The dilated time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt'` by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n        `Δt = γ × Δt'`\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining these gives the formula for the distance:\n        `d = (v × Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   Plugging in the known values:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s × 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 `\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Final Decision**: The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, the value is closest to **3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from our qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Identifying Proper Time**: The most critical step is to correctly identify the given time (50 s) as the \"proper time\" (`Δt'`) because it is measured in the rest frame of the moving clock (the ejecta). A common mistake is to confuse proper time with the time measured by the stationary observer.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction**: This problem is best solved with time dilation. We are given the time in the moving frame and asked for a distance in the stationary frame. This requires calculating the time elapsed in the stationary frame. Applying length contraction would be a more convoluted way to solve this specific problem setup.\n*   **The Power of the Sanity Check**: As demonstrated in Step 3, for many multiple-choice relativity problems, understanding the *direction* of the effect (does time get longer or shorter? does length get longer or shorter?) is often sufficient to eliminate all incorrect options without a full calculation. In this case, knowing the distance must be *greater* than the classical calculation was enough.\n*   **Rounding in Options**: The calculated answer (~3,061,862 km) is not identical to the option (3,060,000 km). It is crucial to recognize that options in such questions are often rounded values and to select the one that is closest to the precise calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the careful points required to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: All candidate answers correctly identify that this problem belongs to the domain of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. The velocity of the ejecta (`v = 60,000 km/s`) is 20% of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`). At such high speeds, classical physics is inaccurate. The specific relativistic phenomenon required to solve the problem is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**: It is essential to correctly define the two frames and the variables associated with them.\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame. The time elapsed in this frame is the dilated time, `Δt`.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The ejecta's reference frame. The given time, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within this frame. This is the **proper time (`Δt' or Δt₀`)**.\n    *   **Given values**: `v = 60,000 km/s`, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n3.  **Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**: This is a powerful step that most of the candidate answers rightly used. It allows for solving the problem by logic alone.\n    *   First, calculate the distance as if relativity didn't exist (a classical calculation): `d_classical = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option **A** in the problem statement.\n    *   According to time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more quickly than it does for the moving object. Therefore, the time `Δt` measured in the Galaxy's frame must be *longer* than the `50 s` proper time (`Δt > 50 s`).\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the relativistic distance `d` must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n    *   Examining the original options:\n        *   A) 3 000 000 km\n        *   B) 3 060 000 km\n        *   C) 2 880 000 km\n        *   D) 2 940 000 km\n    *   Only option **B** is greater than 3,000,000 km. This sanity check is sufficient to identify the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Perform the Full Quantitative Calculation**: To confirm the sanity check, we perform the exact calculation.\n    *   The distance in the stationary frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   The time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor, `γ`: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is given by `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining these gives the final formula for the distance: `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 `\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativity vs. Classical Physics**: The most crucial first step is recognizing that the speed is a significant fraction of `c`, mandating the use of special relativity. Using classical physics leads to the incorrect answer `3,000,000 km`.\n*   **Proper Time Identification**: A common mistake in relativity problems is misidentifying the proper time. The proper time (`Δt₀`) is always the time measured in the frame that is at rest relative to the events being measured (in this case, the clock on the ejecta). The time given, `50 s`, is the proper time.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction**: One must use the correct relativistic effect. Since the problem provides proper time and asks for distance in the stationary frame, the correct approach is to first find the dilated time in the stationary frame. While length contraction is a real effect, applying it here would require a different setup (e.g., being given the distance in the moving frame).\n*   **Interpreting Agent Discrepancies**: The candidate answers showed universal agreement on the physics and the numerical result (~3,062,000 km). The discrepancy in their final letter choice (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) was solely due to their internal systems processing the options in different orders. The core reasoning and result were identical and correct across all agents.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, there is a unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the formulas to be used, and the final numerical result. The minor discrepancies in the letter choices of the answers are due to their internal processing of the multiple-choice options, not any error in the physics or math. Here is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The problem involves an object (the supernova ejecta) moving at `v = 60,000 km/s`. This speed is 20% of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`), making relativistic effects significant. The question compares time and distance between two different inertial reference frames (the ejecta and the Galaxy). This is a classic problem requiring Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key principle is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. A clock in this frame measures the time passed.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt'` or `Δt₀`):** The given time, `50 s`, is measured in the ejecta's moving frame. This is the \"proper time.\"\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** 60,000 km/s.\n    *   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time interval for the same event as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's stationary frame.\n\n3.  **Perform a Qualitative Sanity Check (Logical Elimination):**\n    This is a powerful method used by nearly all the agents to quickly narrow down the possibilities.\n    *   First, calculate the classical distance (ignoring relativity) as a baseline:\n        `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km.`\n        This value corresponds to option **B**.\n    *   The principle of time dilation states that a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta) appears to run slower to an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy). Therefore, for 50 seconds to pass for the ejecta, *more* than 50 seconds must pass in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt > 50 s`).\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `Δt` is greater than 50 s, the distance `d` must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        A) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n        B) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect, this is the classical distance)\n        C) 3 060 000 km (**Correct, this is the only option greater than the classical distance**)\n        D) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n    *   This sanity check alone is sufficient to confidently select the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Perform the Quantitative Calculation (for Confirmation):**\n    To confirm our logical check, we perform the full calculation. The distance `d` is given by the formula:\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    *   The numerator `(v * Δt₀)` is the classical distance: `3,000,000 km`.\n    *   The denominator is the Lorentz factor correction:\n        `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`\n    *   Calculate the result:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Final Decision:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **C) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Proper Time:** The most critical step is to correctly identify that the given `50 s` is the proper time (`Δt₀`), as it's measured in the moving object's own frame of reference.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem is about the passage of time being different between frames, leading to a different calculated distance over that time. It is a time dilation problem. Length contraction would be relevant if we were asked, for instance, about the distance to the Galactic center as measured *by an observer on the ejecta*.\n*   **The Power of the Sanity Check:** In multiple-choice questions involving relativity, first calculating the classical answer and then reasoning whether the relativistic answer should be larger or smaller is an extremely effective strategy for both solving the problem and catching potential calculation errors.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity.

The key phenomenon at play here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame. The time elapsed in this frame is the dilated time, `Δt`.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. The given time of 50 seconds passes in this frame. This is the **proper time (`Δt₀`)**.\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n        *   `Δt₀ = 50 s`\n        *   `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`\n\n3.  **Perform a Qualitative Sanity Check (The most intuitive way to solve):**\n    *   First, calculate what the distance would be if we incorrectly ignored relativity (a classical calculation):\n        `d_classical = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km.`\n        This value corresponds to option **C** in the provided list.\n    *   Next, apply the principle of time dilation. Time dilation states that a clock in a moving frame (the ejecta) will appear to run slower from the perspective of a stationary frame (the Galaxy). This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta (`Δt₀`), a **longer** period of time (`Δt`) will have passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`. Since we know `Δt > 50 s`, the actual distance `d` *must be greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n    *   Looking at the original options:\n        *   A) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n        *   B) 3 060 000 km (**Plausible**, greater than the classical distance)\n        *   C) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect, this is the classical distance itself)\n        *   D) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n    *   This logical check alone is sufficient to determine that **B** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n4.  **Perform the Quantitative Calculation (To confirm):**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame is calculated using the time `Δt` measured in that frame: `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   First, we must find the dilated time `Δt` from the proper time `Δt₀` using the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   We can combine these to find the distance directly:\n        `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n    *   Plugging in the numbers:\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.04) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) `\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from the sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Proper Time:** The most common mistake in these problems is misidentifying the proper time. Proper time (`Δt₀`) is *always* the time measured by a clock in the same reference frame as the event being observed (i.e., the clock is at rest relative to the event). Here, the 50 seconds is measured by a clock on the ejecta, making it the proper time.\n*   **Time Dilation Implication:** A core concept to remember is that dilated time (`Δt`, measured by the stationary observer) is always *longer* than proper time (`Δt₀`) when there is relative motion. This means the relativistic distance measured in the stationary frame will be *greater* than the classical distance `v * Δt₀`.\n*   **Consensus of Agents:** All candidate answers correctly identified the physics and performed the calculation to arrive at the same numerical result (`≈ 3,062,000 km`). The confusion in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) arose from processing the list of options in different orders, not from any error in the physics or math.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the provided answers from the agents, a consensus on the physics, methodology, and numerical result is clear. Here is a consolidated step-by-step analysis, followed by a list of careful points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves an object (the supernova ejecta) moving at a velocity of 60,000 km/s. The speed of light (`c`) is approximately 300,000 km/s, so the ejecta's velocity is `v = 0.2c`. Since this speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, classical Newtonian physics is inadequate. This problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key phenomenon is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from this frame. Let's call this distance `d`.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. A clock in this frame measures the elapsed time as `50 s`. This is the **proper time (`Δt₀`)**, as it is measured in the object's own rest frame.\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time that passes in the stationary frame (the Galaxy). Due to time dilation, this will be longer than the proper time.\n\n**Step 3: The Calculation**\nThe distance traveled as measured in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula `d = v × Δt`. To find `d`, we must first find the dilated time `Δt`.\n\n1.  **Time Dilation Formula:** The dilated time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n2.  **Combined Distance Formula:** We can substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n3.  **Plug in the numbers:**\n    *   `v = 60,000` km/s\n    *   `Δt₀ = 50` s\n    *   `c = 300,000` km/s\n    *   Numerator: `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This is the classical distance.\n    *   Denominator: `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n    *   Final Calculation: `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with Options and Conclude**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options:\n*   A) 2 880 000 km\n*   B) 3 000 000 km\n*   C) 3 060 000 km\n*   D) 2 940 000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Proper Time vs. Dilated Time:** The most critical step is correctly identifying the given 50 seconds as the *proper time* (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the moving frame of the ejecta. A common mistake is to use this time directly in the classical formula `d=v*t`. One must \"dilate\" this time to what an observer in the Galaxy's stationary frame would measure before calculating the distance in that frame.\n\n2.  **Qualitative Sanity Check:** As all the agents noted, a powerful way to approach this problem is with a logical check before calculating. The principle of time dilation means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is *longer* than 50 seconds. Therefore, the distance traveled must be *greater* than the classical distance of `60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. Reviewing the options, only `3,060,000 km` is greater than `3,000,000 km`. This sanity check allows for solving the problem with high confidence without needing a calculator.\n\n3.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** It's important to use the correct relativistic effect. Since the problem provides a time measurement in one frame and asks for a distance in another, time dilation is the relevant concept. We find the time elapsed in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and then use `d = v * Δt`. The concept of length contraction would be relevant if, for example, we were given the length of an object in its own rest frame and asked for its apparent length as it moved past us.\n\n4.  **Consistency Among Agents:** An analysis of all 15 candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principle, the correct formula, and the final numerical result. The different letter choices (A, B, C, D) are merely an artifact of how the options were listed in their respective systems. The universal agreement on the value `~3,060,000 km` provides the highest possible confidence in the result.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the underlying physics and the necessary calculations. The variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the agents is due to inconsistent ordering of the options in their individual problem statements, not due to any disagreement on the correct numerical result. Every agent that performed the calculation correctly arrived at a value of approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle\n\nThe supernova ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, classical Newtonian mechanics is insufficient. The problem must be solved using the principles of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, specifically the phenomenon of **time dilation**.\n\n### Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables\n\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt'`):** The time interval `50 s` is measured in the ejecta's frame. Since it is measured by a clock moving along with the subject, it is the \"proper time\". So, `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** `60,000 km/s`.\n\n### Step 3: Qualitative Sanity Check\n\nThis is a crucial step that can often solve the problem without complex calculation.\n1.  First, calculate the **classical distance** (i.e., ignoring relativity). This gives a baseline for comparison.\n    `d_classical = v × Δt' = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n2.  According to **time dilation**, a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta) is observed to tick slower than a clock in the stationary frame (the Galaxy). This means that for 50 seconds to pass for the ejecta, a **longer time** must have passed in the Galaxy's frame. Let's call this longer time `Δt`. So, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  The distance we need to find is the one measured in the Galaxy's frame, which is `d = v × Δt`. Since `Δt` is greater than 50 s, the resulting distance `d` **must be greater** than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  Let's examine the options based on this insight:\n    *   A) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km -> Incorrect)\n    *   B) 3 060 000 km (Greater than 3,000,000 km -> Plausible)\n    *   C) 3 000 000 km (The classical result -> Incorrect)\n    *   D) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km -> Incorrect)\n    \nThis logical check alone is sufficient to identify **B** as the only possible correct answer.\n\n### Step 4: Quantitative Calculation for Verification\n\nTo confirm the sanity check, we perform the full relativistic calculation. The dilated time (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n\n`Δt = γ × Δt'` where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nThe distance in the stationary frame is `d = v × Δt`. Combining these formulas gives:\n\n`d = (v × Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n*   Numerator (classical distance): `60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n*   Denominator: `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`\n\nSo, `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\nThe calculated distance of **3,061,862 km** is closest to option **B) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic:** The most common mistake is to perform a simple classical calculation (`d=v*t`), which yields 3,000,000 km (Option C). The speed of 0.2c is a clear indicator that relativity is required.\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** It is essential to correctly identify the given `50 s` as the proper time (`Δt'`) because it is measured in the moving object's own frame.\n3.  **Time Dilation, Not Length Contraction:** The problem is about a duration measured in one frame being used to calculate a distance in another frame, which directly involves time dilation. Length contraction is a different effect related to measuring the length of a moving object.\n4.  **Direction of the Effect:** Time *dilation* means the time measured in the stationary frame is *longer*, which in turn means the distance measured is *greater* than the classical distance. This provides the basis for the powerful sanity check.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, there is a strong consensus on the physics and calculation required. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to differing option lists, but the numerical result is consistent. Here is a definitive step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves an object, the supernova ejecta, moving at a very high velocity (`v = 60,000 km/s`). This speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`), specifically 20% (`v = 0.2c`). When comparing measurements between different inertial frames of reference at such speeds, classical physics is insufficient. This problem requires the application of **Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity**, and the key phenomenon at play is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. A clock in this frame measures the time interval.\n*   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt'`):** The time given, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time.\"\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative Sanity Check**\nBefore performing the full calculation, we can use logic to eliminate incorrect options.\n1.  **Classical Calculation (Non-Relativistic):** If we were to ignore relativity, the distance would be a simple multiplication: `distance = velocity × time`.\n    `d_classical = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This value matches option C.\n2.  **Relativistic Effect (Time Dilation):** The theory of time dilation states that an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt' = 50 s`) measured in the moving frame (the ejecta). So, for the observer in the Galaxy, *more* than 50 seconds have passed.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the resulting distance `d` must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n4.  **Checking the Options:**\n    *   **A) 3 060 000 km** (Greater than 3,000,000 km - Plausible)\n    *   B) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km - Incorrect)\n    *   C) 3 000 000 km (The classical result - Incorrect)\n    *   D) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km - Incorrect)\n\nThis logical sanity check is powerful enough to determine that **A** is the only possible correct answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm our reasoning, we perform the precise calculation. The dilated time (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`). The distance is `d = v × Δt`.\n\nThe combined formula for the distance is:\n`d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n*   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n*   `Δt' = 50 s`\n*   `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`\n\n`d = (60,000 × 50) / √(1 - (60,000 / 300,000)²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.04) `\n`d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 `\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 `\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Compare and Conclude**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. We compare this with the given options:\n*   A) 3 060 000 km\n*   B) 2 940 000 km\n*   C) 3 000 000 km\n*   D) 2 880 000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from our qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Identifying Proper Time:** The most critical step is correctly identifying that the `50 s` time interval is the **proper time** (`Δt'`) because it's measured by a clock in the same reference frame as the event's duration (i.e., moving with the ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation, Not Length Contraction:** The problem is solved most directly by considering how time is measured differently between the frames. While length contraction is another relativistic effect, calculating the dilated time is the direct path to the answer.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Result:** A key takeaway from time dilation is that the time measured by the stationary observer is always longer. Consequently, the distance calculated (`d = v × Δt`) in the stationary frame will be greater than the classical distance calculated using proper time (`d = v × Δt'`). This provides the basis for the sanity check.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, there is a universal consensus on the physical principles, the required formulas, and the final numerical result.

The disagreement on the final letter (A, B, C, or D) is merely an artifact of their different internal representations of the options list.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, all agents correctly identified the physics and performed the necessary calculations. The variance in their final letter choice is due to inconsistent ordering of the multiple-choice options in their respective environments. The following is a definitive step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle\nThe problem involves an object, the supernova ejecta, moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's speed as a fraction of the speed of light is `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of `c`. Since this speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, the principles of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity must be used. The key phenomenon in this problem is **time dilation**.\n\n### Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀` or `Δt'`):** The time measured in the moving frame is `50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is at rest relative to the events it is timing (i.e., the clock is on the ejecta). So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time interval measured in the stationary Galaxy frame. According to relativity, this will be longer than the proper time.\n*   **Distance in Stationary Frame (`d`):** This is the value we need to calculate using the formula `d = v × Δt`.\n\n### Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"\nBefore doing any complex math, we can use logic to eliminate incorrect options.\n1.  **Calculate the classical distance:** If we ignored relativity, the distance would be simply `distance = velocity × time`. Using the time from the ejecta's frame, we get:\n    `d_classical = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n    This classical result corresponds to **Option A**.\n2.  **Apply the principle of time dilation:** Time dilation states that a clock moving relative to an observer will be measured to tick slower. This means that while 50 seconds (`Δt₀`) pass for the ejecta, a longer time interval (`Δt`) will have passed in the Galaxy's frame. So, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  **Draw a logical conclusion:** Since the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`, and `Δt > 50 s`, the actual relativistic distance must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n4.  **Check the options:**\n    A) 3 000 000 km (The incorrect classical result)\n    B) 2 880 000 km (Less than the classical result)\n    C) 2 940 000 km (Less than the classical result)\n    D) 3 060 000 km (**The only plausible answer**, as it is greater than the classical result)\n\nThis sanity check is sufficient to confidently select the correct answer.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation\nTo confirm our reasoning, we will now calculate the precise distance.\n1.  The formula for the distance in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`.\n2.  The dilated time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `Δt = γ × Δt₀`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n3.  We can combine these into a single formula for distance:\n    `d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n4.  Now, we plug in the values:\n    `d = (60,000 km/s × 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.979796 `\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km `\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion and Careful Points\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **D) 3,060,000 km**. The minor difference of ~0.06% is due to the options being rounded values. This confirms the result from our sanity check.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Recognizing the need for relativity:** The speed is 20% the speed of light, so classical physics is inadequate. The classical answer is present as a distractor (Option A).\n*   **Identifying the proper time:** It is critical to recognize that the given time of 50 s is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the moving object's frame. A common error is to mistake this for the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`).\n*   **Applying the correct effect:** This problem requires time dilation. The time for the event is measured as being longer in the stationary frame, leading to a greater distance travelled than in the classical case. An incorrect application could lead to a result smaller than the classical one (Options B and C).\n*   **Using the sanity check:** As shown in Step 3, simple logic can often solve relativity problems or, at the very least, eliminate all but one option, providing a check against calculation errors.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, here is a consolidated step-by-step breakdown of the problem and its solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem involves a supernova ejecta moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. This is 20% of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`), making relativistic effects significant. The question compares time and distance measurements between two inertial frames of reference (the ejecta and the Galaxy), which means this is a problem of Special Relativity. The key principle is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** `60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt'`):** The time of `50 s` is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time.\"\n\n3.  **Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\":**\n    *   First, calculate the classical distance (ignoring relativity) as a baseline. This would be `distance = velocity × time`.\n        `d_classical = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option D.\n    *   According to the theory of time dilation, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a *longer* time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt' = 50 s`) measured in the moving frame. Therefore, `Δt > 50 s`.\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `Δt` is greater than `50 s`, the distance `d` must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n    *   Reviewing the options:\n        A) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect)\n        B) 3 060 000 km (Plausible)\n        C) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect)\n        D) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect)\n    *   This logical check alone is sufficient to identify **B** as the only possible answer.\n\n4.  **Perform the Quantitative Calculation:**\n    To confirm the sanity check, we perform the full relativistic calculation. The distance is found using `d = v × Δt`. We first need to find the dilated time, `Δt`.\n    *   The formula for time dilation relates `Δt` to `Δt'` via the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining the formulas gives a direct expression for the distance:\n        `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Now, we substitute the values:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96) `\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 `\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**. This result is confirmed by both the logical sanity check and the precise calculation.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The most critical step is correctly identifying the `50 s` interval as the \"proper time\" (`Δt'`) because it's measured in the rest frame of the moving object (the ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation Implication:** A common misconception is to think time \"slows down\" in a way that reduces distances. However, from the stationary observer's perspective, the moving clock is slow, meaning more time passes on the stationary clock during the event. This leads to a *greater* measured distance `d = v × Δt`.\n*   **Sanity Check Power:** In multiple-choice questions involving relativity, a quick qualitative check is often sufficient. Knowing whether the final value should be greater or smaller than the classical value can quickly eliminate most incorrect options.\n*   **Consistency Among Agents:** All candidate answers correctly identified the physics and performed the calculation to arrive at the same numerical result. The variance in their final letter choice was an artifact of how they listed the options, but their conclusion on the correct *value* was unanimous.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers, here is a consolidated step-by-step reasoning and a list of careful points to consider for this problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nAll candidate answers correctly recognize that the ejecta's velocity (`v = 60,000 km/s`) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`). The ratio is `v/c = 0.2`. Therefore, this is not a problem of classical physics but one that requires Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. The key principle to be applied is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Key Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The reference frame of the Galaxy. The question asks for the distance (`d`) traveled by the ejecta as measured by an observer in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The reference frame of the ejecta.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt'):** The time interval of `50 s` is measured by a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta). This is known as the \"proper time\" because it is the time measured by a clock at rest relative to the event.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative Sanity Check**\nThis is a crucial step that many candidates correctly used to quickly narrow down the answer.\n1.  **Classical Calculation:** If we ignore relativity, the distance would be `distance = velocity × time`.\n    `d_classical = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    This corresponds to option **D**.\n2.  **Relativistic Effect:** The principle of time dilation states that an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt' = 50 s`) measured in the moving frame. Therefore, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The distance as measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `Δt` is greater than 50 s, the resulting distance `d` *must be greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Elimination:** Examining the options:\n    A) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km)\n    B) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km)\n    C) 3 060 000 km (Greater than 3,000,000 km)\n    D) 3 000 000 km (The classical result itself)\nThis logical check alone is sufficient to determine that **C** is the only plausible answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm the sanity check, we perform the full relativistic calculation. The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is `d = v * Δt`. The time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt'` by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\nThe complete formula is: `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n1.  Plug in the values:\n    *   `v * Δt' = 3,000,000 km`\n    *   `v²/c² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n2.  Calculate the distance:\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.04)`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this result with the provided options, it is closest to option **C) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly Identifying the Physics:** The most important step is recognizing that the speed is relativistic and that time dilation is the relevant principle, not classical mechanics.\n2.  **Correctly Identifying Proper Time:** It is essential to identify the given `50 s` as the proper time (`Δt'`) because it is measured in the object's own moving reference frame. A common mistake is to misidentify this as the observer's time.\n3.  **Using the Sanity Check:** The qualitative analysis is a powerful tool. By calculating the classical distance first, you can immediately determine whether the relativistic answer should be larger (time dilation) or smaller (length contraction). In this case, since distance is based on the observer's *dilated* time, it must be larger. This helps avoid calculation errors.\n4.  **Consistency Among Candidates:** All provided candidate answers correctly identified the physics, the formula, and performed the calculation to arrive at the same numerical result (`≈3,062,000 km`). The variation in their final letter choice (`A`, `B`, `C`, or `D`) is clearly due to them having the options listed in a different order, but their underlying analysis is unanimous and correct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the unanimous reasoning of the provided answers and highlighting careful points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves an object (the supernova ejecta) moving at a very high velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`. This is 20% of the speed of light (`c` ≈ 300,000 km/s), making `v = 0.2c`. When dealing with such speeds and comparing measurements between two different inertial frames of reference (the ejecta and the Galaxy), the principles of classical physics are no longer accurate. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key phenomenon is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** `60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The time of `50 s` is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time\" because it is the time interval measured by a clock at rest relative to the event it is timing.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Relativistic Calculation**\nThe distance measured in the Galaxy's frame (`d`) is the ejecta's velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n\n*   `d = v × Δt`\n\nDue to time dilation, the time measured in the stationary Galaxy frame (`Δt`) is longer than the proper time (`Δt₀`) measured in the moving ejecta's frame. The relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n\n*   `Δt = γ × Δt₀`\n*   where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\nCombining these formulas gives the direct calculation for the distance:\n\n*   `d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n1.  Calculate the \"classical\" distance (the numerator): `v × Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n2.  Calculate the Lorentz factor's denominator: `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n3.  Calculate the final distance: `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with Options and Conclude**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. We compare this to the options provided:\n*   A) 2 940 000 km\n*   B) 2 880 000 km\n*   C) 3 060 000 km\n*   D) 3 000 000 km\n\nThe calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The \"Sanity Check\" is Key:** Before any complex calculation, it's crucial to apply logic. The classical, non-relativistic distance would be `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option D). Because of time dilation, we know the time measured by the Galaxy observer is *longer* than 50 seconds. Therefore, the distance measured by the Galaxy observer must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km. This simple check immediately eliminates options A, B, and D, leaving only C as the plausible answer.\n\n2.  **Correctly Identifying \"Proper Time\"**: The most common error in these types of problems is confusing the two time measurements. The \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) is always the time measured by a clock that is at rest in the frame of reference being observed. Here, the `50 s` is measured by the ejecta's clock, making it the proper time.\n\n3.  **Time Dilation, not Length Contraction**: The problem gives a *time* in the moving frame and asks for a *distance* in the stationary frame. The correct path is to first dilate the time (`Δt = γΔt₀`) and then calculate the distance (`d = vΔt`). One might be tempted to use length contraction, but that would apply if, for example, we were given a proper length (e.g., the length of a spaceship at rest) and asked for its observed length as it flies by.\n\n4.  **Agent Consensus**: It is important to note that all 15 candidate answers, despite showing different final letter choices, were unanimous in their physical reasoning, mathematical formula, and calculated numerical result (~3,061,862 km). The discrepancy in the final letter is an artifact of the agents processing a scrambled list of options, but their core conclusion on the *value* is identical and correct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers, there is a clear consensus on the physical principles and the numerical calculation required. The variation in the final letter choices is due to different ordering of the options by the agents, but the underlying reasoning is unanimously correct.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem and Identify the Core Physical Principle\n\nThe problem describes an object, the supernova ejecta, moving at a very high velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light `c` is approximately `300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's speed is therefore `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this speed is a significant fraction of `c`, the laws of classical physics are insufficient. This is a problem in Einstein's **Special Theory of Relativity**, and the key concept required is **Time Dilation**.\n\n### Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables\n\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance `d` as measured in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** `60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀` or `Δt'`):** The time interval measured in the moving frame (`S'`) is given as `50 s`. This is called the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest within its own frame.\n\n### Step 3: Perform a Qualitative Sanity Check\n\nThis logical step can often solve the problem without a full calculation.\n1.  **Classical Calculation:** First, we calculate the distance as if relativity didn't exist:\n    `d_classical = v × Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This value matches option (B).\n2.  **Relativistic Effect:** The principle of time dilation states that a moving clock runs slower as observed by a stationary observer. This means that while 50 seconds (`Δt₀`) pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy will measure a *longer* time interval (`Δt`).\n3.  **Conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and we know `Δt > Δt₀`, the resulting distance `d` must be **greater than** the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Check the Options:**\n    A) 2 940 000 km (less than 3,000,000 km) -> Incorrect.\n    B) 3 000 000 km (the classical result) -> Incorrect.\n    C) 3 060 000 km (greater than 3,000,000 km) -> **Plausible**.\n    D) 2 880 000 km (less than 3,000,000 km) -> Incorrect.\nThis logical check alone is sufficient to determine that (C) must be the correct answer.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Full Quantitative Calculation\n\nTo confirm the result from the sanity check, we perform the exact calculation.\n1.  The formula for time dilation relates the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) to the proper time (`Δt₀`) using the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n2.  The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n3.  The distance in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Combining these formulas gives:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n4.  Now, plug in the values:\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.979796...`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated distance is **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the given options:\n*   A) 2 940 000 km\n*   B) 3 000 000 km\n*   C) 3 060 000 km\n*   D) 2 880 000 km\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**. This confirms the result from our initial logical check.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Relativity vs. Classical Physics:** The key is to recognize that the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v=0.2c`), mandating the use of special relativity.\n2.  **Proper Time:** It is crucial to correctly identify the given `50 s` as the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's the time measured in the object's own moving frame.\n3.  **Time Dilation, Not Length Contraction:** The problem gives the time in the moving frame and asks for distance in the stationary frame. This requires calculating the dilated time (`Δt`) in the stationary frame first and then using `d = v × Δt`. One should not confuse this with length contraction, which concerns the measured length of a moving object.\n4.  **Direction of the Effect:** Time dilation always means the time interval measured by a stationary observer (`Δt`) is *longer* than the proper time (`Δt₀`). Therefore, the relativistic distance measured in the stationary frame will always be *greater* than the classical distance calculated using the proper time.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
