Understand the Chemistry**\n\nTo dissolve iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, which is a sparingly soluble solid, we need to add an acid. The strong acid will react with the hydroxide component of Fe(OH)₃, shifting the dissolution equilibrium to the right. The overall reaction is:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe added acid serves two purposes:\n*   It provides the H⁺ ions needed to react stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   It provides the excess H⁺ ions required to remain in the solution to keep the final pH low enough to prevent the Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃. The dissolution is governed by the solubility product, Ksp: Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq). A low pH (high [H⁺]) ensures a very low [OH⁻], keeping the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ below Ksp.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)₃ we are trying to dissolve.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = M(Fe) + 3 × M(O) + 3 × M(H)\n    M(Fe(OH)₃) = 55.85 g/mol + 3 × 16.00 g/mol + 3 × 1.01 g/mol = 106.88 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / molar mass\n    Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 9.356 × 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n**3. Set up the Mass Balance Equation for the Acid (H⁺)**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid must equal the amount consumed in the reaction plus the amount remaining in the final solution.\n\nTotal Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Consumed + Moles H⁺ Remaining\n\n*   **Moles H⁺ Consumed:** From the stoichiometry (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺), 3 moles of H⁺ are consumed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles H⁺ Consumed = 3 × (moles of Fe(OH)₃) = 3 × (9.356 × 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 × 10⁻³ mol.\n\n*   **Moles H⁺ Remaining:** This is the amount of H⁺ in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution, which determines its pH.\n    Moles H⁺ Remaining = [H⁺]final × Vtotal = [H⁺]final × 0.1 L.\n    Since pH = -log[H⁺], we have [H⁺]final = 10⁻pH.\n    Moles H⁺ Remaining = (10⁻pH) × 0.1 L.\n\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:** This comes from the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid.\n    Total Moles H⁺ Added = Cacid × Vacid = 0.1 M × Vacid.\n\nCombining these parts, our governing equation is:\n**0.1 × Vacid = (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (10⁻pH × 0.1)**\n\n**4. Test the Given Options**\n\nSince we have two unknowns (Vacid and pH), we cannot solve the equation directly. However, the problem provides pairs of values in the options. We can test each option to see which one satisfies our equation.\n\n**A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n*   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = 2.040 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   This is less than the 2.807 × 10⁻³ mol required just to consume the Fe(OH)₃. Therefore, this option is impossible.\n\n**B) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   Left side of equation: Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = 3.214 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   Right side of equation: (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (10⁻³.¹⁶ × 0.1) = (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (6.92 × 10⁻⁴ × 0.1) = 2.807 × 10⁻³ + 0.069 × 10⁻³ = 2.876 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   3.214 × 10⁻³ ≠ 2.876 × 10⁻³. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   Left side of equation: Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **3.009 × 10⁻³ mol**.\n*   Right side of equation: (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (10⁻².⁶⁹ × 0.1) = (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (2.042 × 10⁻³ × 0.1) = 2.807 × 10⁻³ + 0.204 × 10⁻³ = **3.011 × 10⁻³ mol**.\n*   The values 3.009 × 10⁻³ and 3.011 × 10⁻³ are extremely close. The small difference is due to rounding of molar masses and constants. This option is self-consistent.\n\n**D) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n*   Left side of equation: Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 2.805 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   Right side of equation: (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (10⁻².⁰⁴ × 0.1) = (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (9.12 × 10⁻³ × 0.1) = 2.807 × 10⁻³ + 0.912 × 10⁻³ = 3.719 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   2.805 × 10⁻³ ≠ 3.719 × 10⁻³. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly option C provides a pair of values for volume and pH that are consistent with the chemical principles and stoichiometry of the dissolution process.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles\n\n### Step 2: Determine the volume of strong acid needed\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid is a neutralization reaction. The net ionic equation is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of this reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol\n\nThe problem states we are using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, which provides 0.1 moles of H⁺ per liter (1000 cm³). We can now calculate the minimum volume of this acid needed.\n*   Volume (L) = Moles of H⁺ / Molarity = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L ≈ 0.02807 L\n*   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 28.07 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume matches the value given in option D (28.05 cm³), with the minor difference likely due to rounding of molar masses.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n\nWhen the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved by the stoichiometric amount of acid, the resulting solution contains Fe³⁺ ions in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The Fe³⁺ ion, more accurately the hexaaquairon(III) ion, [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺, acts as a weak acid by hydrolyzing water.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n\nFirst, calculate the concentration of the Fe³⁺ ion in the final solution:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ / Total Volume = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009357 M\n\nTo find the pH, we need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ ion. According to multiple sources, the Ka for this ion is approximately 6.0 x 10⁻³.\n\nNow, we set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺:\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ | 0.009357 | -x | 0.009357 - x |\n| [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺| 0 | +x | x |\n| H₃O⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nThe Ka expression is:\nKa = [H₃O⁺] * [[Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺] / [[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺]\n6.0 x 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.009357 - x)\n\nThis gives the quadratic equation:\nx² + (6.0 x 10⁻³)x - (5.614 x 10⁻⁵) = 0\n\nSolving for x using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\n*   x = [-(6.0 x 10⁻³) ± √((6.0 x 10⁻³)² - 4(1)(-5.614 x 10⁻⁵))] / 2\n*   x = [-0.006 ± √(3.6 x 10⁻⁵ + 2.2456 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\n*   x = [-0.006 ± √(2.6056 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\n*   x = [-0.006 ± 0.01614] / 2\n\nSince concentration (x) must be positive, we take the positive root:\n*   x = (0.01014) / 2 ≈ 0.00507 M\n\nThe concentration of H₃O⁺ is x, so [H₃O⁺] ≈ 0.00507 M.\n\nFinally, we calculate the pH:\n*   pH = -log[H₃O⁺] = -log(0.00507) ≈ 2.29\n\nThis calculated pH (2.29) is closest to the pH value in option D (2.04). The discrepancy can arise from using slightly different values for molar masses, the Ka of Fe³⁺, or the Ksp of Fe(OH)₃, which can vary between sources. However, the calculated acid volume is a very strong match for option D, and the pH is in the correct acidic range, making D the most plausible answer.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Volume of acid: 28.05 cm³ (matches calculation)\n*   pH: 2.04 (reasonably close to the calculated value of 2.29, and much closer than other options)\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve this chemistry problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculations and identify the correct answer.\n\n### Plan and Explanation\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry:** To dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, we need to add an acid. The acid (H⁺) reacts with the hydroxide part of the solid in a neutralization reaction:\n    `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n    This equation tells us that 3 moles of H⁺ are consumed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ dissolved.\n\n2.  **Account for Equilibrium:** Simply adding the exact amount of acid from the stoichiometry above is not enough. The dissolution is an equilibrium process governed by the solubility product, Ksp:\n    `Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)`\n    `Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³`\n    To keep all the Fe³⁺ ions in solution, the concentration of hydroxide ions, [OH⁻], must be kept very low. This requires an excess of H⁺ ions to remain in the solution, making the final solution acidic. The pH of the final solution is determined by this excess H⁺.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:** The total amount of acid we need to add must do two things:\n    a.  Provide the H⁺ ions that are consumed in the reaction (the stoichiometric amount).\n    b.  Provide the excess H⁺ ions that remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to maintain a sufficiently low pH to prevent re-precipitation.\n\n4.  **Strategy:** The problem provides four possible answers, each with a pH and a volume. The correct answer must be self-consistent. We can write a program to check each option. For each pair of (pH, Volume):\n    a.  Calculate the total moles of H⁺ added using the given volume and acid concentration.\n    b.  Calculate the moles of excess H⁺ remaining in the solution using the given pH and total volume.\n    c.  Subtract the remaining moles from the total moles to find out how many moles of H⁺ must have reacted with the Fe(OH)₃.\n    d.  Separately, calculate the theoretical moles of H⁺ required to react with 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ based on stoichiometry.\n    e.  The correct option will be the one where the moles of H⁺ reacted (from step c) match the theoretical stoichiometric requirement (from step d).\n\nLet's execute this plan with Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the required acid volume and resulting pH to dissolve Fe(OH)3,\n    and evaluates the given options to find the correct one.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Given Constants ---\n    mass_feoh3 = 0.1  # g\n    total_volume = 0.1  # L (100 cm^3)\n    acid_concentration = 0.1  # M\n    \n    # Molar masses (g/mol)\n    molar_mass_Fe = 55.845\n    molar_mass_O = 15.999\n    molar_mass_H = 1.008\n    molar_mass_feoh3 = molar_mass_Fe + 3 * (molar_mass_O + molar_mass_H) # 106.866 g/mol\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate theoretical moles needed for reaction ---\n    moles_feoh3 = mass_feoh3 / molar_mass_feoh3\n    # From Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> Fe(3+) + 3H2O, we need 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3\n    stoichiometric_moles_h_reacted = 3 * moles_feoh3\n\n    print(\"--- Problem Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Molar Mass of Fe(OH)3: {molar_mass_feoh3:.3f} g/mol\")\n    print(f\"Moles of Fe(OH)3 to dissolve: {moles_feoh3:.6f} mol\")\n    print(f\"Stoichiometric moles of H+ required for reaction: {stoichiometric_moles_h_reacted:.6f} mol\")\n    print(\"-\" * 25)\n    print(\"--- Evaluating Options ---\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Evaluate each option for consistency ---\n    options = {\n        'A': {'pH': 4.94, 'volume_cm3': 20.40},\n        'B': {'pH': 3.16, 'volume_cm3': 32.14},\n        'C': {'pH': 2.69, 'volume_cm3': 30.09},\n        'D': {'pH': 2.04, 'volume_cm3': 28.05},\n    }\n\n    correct_option = None\n\n    for key, values in options.items():\n        ph = values['pH']\n        volume_L = values['volume_cm3'] / 1000.0\n\n        # Total moles of H+ added from the acid\n        total_moles_h_added = acid_concentration * volume_L\n\n        # Moles of H+ remaining in the final solution to maintain the pH\n        final_h_concentration = 10**(-ph)\n        moles_h_remaining = final_h_concentration * total_volume\n\n        # Moles of H+ that must have reacted with Fe(OH)3\n        calculated_moles_h_reacted = total_moles_h_added - moles_h_remaining\n        \n        # Compare calculated reacted moles with the theoretical stoichiometric value\n        difference = abs(calculated_moles_h_reacted - stoichiometric_moles_h_reacted)\n        percent_error = (difference / stoichiometric_moles_h_reacted) * 100\n\n        print(f\"\\nOption {key}: pH {ph}, Volume {values['volume_cm3']} cm3\")\n        print(f\"  - Total H+ added: {total_moles_h_added:.6f} mol\")\n        print(f\"  - H+ remaining in solution: {moles_h_remaining:.6f} mol\")\n        print(f\"  - Implied H+ reacted: {calculated_moles_h_reacted:.6f} mol\")\n        print(f\"  - Consistency Check: The implied reacted amount ({calculated_moles_h_reacted:.6f} mol) should match the stoichiometric requirement ({stoichiometric_moles_h_reacted:.6f} mol).\")\n        print(f\"  - Error: {percent_error:.2f}%\")\n\n        # A small error (<1%) is acceptable due to rounding in the problem's values\n        if percent_error < 1.0:\n            correct_option = key\n            print(\"  - Verdict: This option is chemically consistent.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"  - Verdict: This option is not consistent.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    if correct_option:\n        print(f\"The only consistent option is {correct_option}.\")\n        print(f\"Final Answer: pH {options[correct_option]['pH']};

The final volume of the solution will be 100 cm³. We need to find the minimum volume of acid required and the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n        *   Atomic mass of Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n        *   Atomic mass of O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n        *   Atomic mass of H ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n        *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 55.85 + 3 * (17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol.\n    *   Now, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ from the given mass.\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n3.  **Write the Chemical Reaction:**\n    *   The strong acid provides H⁺ ions, which react with the hydroxide (OH⁻) from Fe(OH)₃ in a neutralization reaction.\n    *   The balanced chemical equation for the dissolution is:\n        Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Needed for the Reaction:**\n    *   From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n    *   This is the amount of H⁺ needed just to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃.\n\n5.  **Consider the Final Solution:**\n    *   After the reaction, the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution contains the dissolved Fe³⁺ ions.\n    *   To keep the Fe³⁺ ions in solution and prevent Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating, the solution must be acidic. This means there must be some excess H⁺ ions remaining after the neutralization reaction.\n    *   The total moles of H⁺ added from the acid must be equal to the moles that reacted plus the moles that remain in excess.\n        *   Total H⁺ added = H⁺ (reacted) + H⁺ (excess)\n\n6.  **Test the Options for Internal Consistency:**\n    *   The problem is a multiple-choice question, and the correct option must be self-consistent. We can test each option to see if the given volume of acid results in the given pH.\n    *   Let V_acid be the volume of acid in cm³.\n    *   Total moles H⁺ added = Concentration * Volume = 0.1 mol/L * (V_acid / 1000) L\n    *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = (Total H⁺ added) - (H⁺ reacted)\n    *   Final [H⁺] = Moles H⁺ (excess) / Final Volume = Moles H⁺ (excess) / 0.1 L\n    *   Final pH = -log([H⁺])\n\n    Let's check **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n    *   **Volume of acid (V_acid):** 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    *   **Total moles H⁺ added:** 0.1 mol/L * 0.03009 L = 0.003009 mol.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ (reacted):** We calculated this in Step 4 as 0.002807 mol.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ (excess):** 0.003009 mol - 0.002807 mol = 0.000202 mol.\n    *   **Final [H⁺]:** 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n    *   **Calculate the resulting pH:** pH = -log(0.00202) ≈ 2.6947.\n\n    This calculated pH of ~2.69 matches the pH given in Option B. Let's quickly check another option to be sure.\n\n    Let's check **Option C: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n\n    *   **Volume of acid (V_acid):** 32.14 cm³ = 0.03214 L\n    *   **Total moles H⁺ added:** 0.1 mol/L * 0.03214 L = 0.003214 mol.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ (excess):** 0.003214 mol - 0.002807 mol = 0.000407 mol.\n    *   **Final [H⁺]:** 0.000407 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00407 M.\n    *   **Calculate the resulting pH:** pH = -log(0.00407) ≈ 2.39.\n    *   This calculated pH (2.39) does not match the given pH (3.16). Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\n    Options A and D provide insufficient acid to even dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ completely, as the moles of H⁺ added would be less than the 0.002807 moles required for the reaction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only option where the volume of acid and the final pH are consistent with the stoichiometry of the reaction is Option B. The \"minimum volume\" condition is met because this is the point where the solution is just saturated, which corresponds to the calculated pH.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation Check:\n*   Acid added: 30.09 cm³ of 0.1 M H⁺.\n*   Moles H⁺ added: 0.003009 mol.\n*   Moles H⁺ to dissolve Fe(OH)₃: 0.002807 mol.\n*   Excess H⁺: 0.003009 - 0.002807 = 0.000202 mol.\n*   Final [H⁺] in 100 cm³: 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n*   Final pH: -log(0.00202) = 2.69.\nThe values are consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Reaction:** The dissolution of solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a strong acid (like HCl or HNO₃, represented by H⁺) is an acid-base neutralization reaction. The balanced chemical equation is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Stoichiometry:** From the balanced equation, we see that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n3.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Given mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g.\n    *   Calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃:\n        *   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n        *   O: 15.999 g/mol\n        *   H: 1.008 g/mol\n        *   Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n4.  **Calculate Moles of H⁺ Needed for Reaction:**\n    *   Using the 1:3 stoichiometric ratio from the balanced equation:\n        *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n        *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n5.  **Account for Final pH (Excess Acid):** To ensure all the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves and remains in solution (i.e., to prevent it from precipitating back out), there must be some excess H⁺ ions remaining in the final solution. The concentration of these excess ions determines the final pH.\n    *   The total moles of H⁺ added from the acid must equal the moles that reacted plus the moles that remain in excess in the final solution.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (final/excess).\n    *   The moles of excess H⁺ are calculated from the final pH and the total volume:\n        *   [H⁺]final = 10⁻ᵖᴴ\n        *   Moles H⁺ (final/excess) = [H⁺]final × Total Volume (in L)\n        *   Total Volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n\n6.  **Calculate Required Acid Volume:** The total moles of H⁺ are supplied by the 0.1 M monobasic strong acid.\n    *   Volume of Acid (L) = Total Moles H⁺ / Concentration of Acid\n    *   Volume of Acid (cm³) = (Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M) × 1000\n\n7.  **Systematic Check of Options:** Since we have two unknowns (final pH and acid volume), we can't solve directly. However, we can use the provided options to see which pair of (pH, Volume) is self-consistent. We will use the pH from each option to calculate the required volume and see if it matches the volume given in that same option.\n\n    *   **Let's test Option B (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³):**\n        *   **Step 1: Find moles of excess H⁺.**\n            *   [H⁺]final = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n            *   Moles H⁺ (final/excess) = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.0002042 mol.\n        *   **Step 2: Find total moles of H⁺ needed.**\n            *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (final/excess)\n            *   Total Moles H⁺ ≈ 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol ≈ 0.0030112 mol.\n        *   **Step 3: Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid required.**\n            *   Volume (cm³) = (0.0030112 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 ≈ 30.11 cm³.\n\n8.  **Compare and Conclude:** The calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ is extremely close to the volume given in Option B (30.09 cm³). The small difference is negligible and likely due to rounding of constants or the values in the question itself. The Python code execution confirms this match precisely and shows that the other options are inconsistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the moles of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we calculate the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Atomic mass of Iron (Fe) ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 moles.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the required volume of strong acid\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) follows this neutralization reaction:\n\n**Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions for complete dissolution.\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 moles.\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed to provide this amount of H⁺.\n*   Volume (L) = Moles / Molarity\n*   Volume (L) = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L.\n\nTo convert this volume to cubic centimeters (cm³), we multiply by 1000.\n*   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume is very close to the value of 28.05 cm³ provided in option D.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n\nAfter the reaction, the 0.0009356 moles of Fe(OH)₃ are converted into 0.0009356 moles of Fe³⁺ ions. The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L.\n\nFirst, calculate the concentration of the Fe³⁺ ions.\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume (L)\n*   [Fe³⁺] = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M.\n\nThe iron(III) ion (Fe³⁺) is a weak acid that hydrolyzes in water, producing H⁺ ions and thus lowering the pH. The hydrolysis reaction is:\n\n**Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)**\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction (Ka) for the hydrated iron(III) ion is approximately 6.5 x 10⁻³.\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the H⁺ concentration at equilibrium.\n*   Initial: [Fe³⁺] = 0.009356 M, [H⁺] ≈ 0\n*   Change: [Fe³⁺] = -x, [H⁺] = +x\n*   Equilibrium: [Fe³⁺] = 0.009356 - x, [H⁺] = x\n\nThe Ka expression is:\nKa = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = (x)(x) / (0.009356 - x)\n6.5 x 10⁻³ = x² / (0.009356 - x)\n\nThis can be rearranged into a quadratic equation:\nx² + (6.5 x 10⁻³)x - (6.08 x 10⁻⁵) = 0\n\nSolving for x (which represents [H⁺]) using the quadratic formula:\nx = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a\nx = [-0.0065 + √((0.0065)² - 4(1)(-6.08 x 10⁻⁵))] / 2\nx = [-0.0065 + √(4.225 x 10⁻⁵ + 2.432 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.0065 + √(2.8545 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.0065 + 0.01689] / 2\nx = 0.01039 / 2 = 0.005195 M\n\nSo, the concentration of H⁺ is 0.005195 M. Now, we can calculate the pH.\n*   pH = -log₁₀[H⁺]\n*   pH = -log₁₀(0.005195) ≈ 2.28\n\nThis pH value (2.28) is closest to the pH of 2.04 in option D. The minor difference can be attributed to variations in the published Ka value for the Fe³⁺ ion or slight rounding during intermediate steps. Based on both the calculated volume and the pH, option D is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the minimum volume of strong acid needed**\n\n1.  **Write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution.**\n    Iron(III) hydroxide, a base, reacts with a strong acid (providing H⁺ ions) in a neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃.**\n    First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Molar mass of Fe ≈ 55.845 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 15.999 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of H ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n\n    Now, calculate the moles from the given mass:\n    Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n3.  **Determine the moles of H⁺ required.**\n    From the stoichiometry of the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n    Moles of H⁺ = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.00280725 mol.\n\n4.  **Calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid.**\n    The \"minimum volume\" required is the stoichiometric amount needed to completely react with all the Fe(OH)₃.\n    Volume = Moles / Concentration\n    Volume of acid = 0.00280725 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280725 L.\n\n5.  **Convert the volume to cm³.**\n    Volume in cm³ = 0.0280725 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 28.07 cm³.\n\n    This calculated volume is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option B. The minor difference is likely due to rounding of atomic masses used in the original problem.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution**\n\n1.  **Determine the composition of the final solution.**\n    After reacting 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ with 28.05 cm³ of 0.1 M acid, the strong acid is completely consumed. The resulting 100 cm³ solution contains the product, Fe³⁺ ions.\n    Moles of Fe³⁺ formed = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ dissolved ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n    Concentration of Fe³⁺ = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.00936 M.\n\n2.  **Consider the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ ion.**\n    The iron(III) ion is a small, highly charged metal ion that acts as a weak acid in water by hydrolyzing it:\n    [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n    For simplicity, this is often written as:\n    Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH from hydrolysis.**\n    The pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of H⁺ (or H₃O⁺) produced in this equilibrium. This requires the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the hydrated Fe³⁺ ion. Literature values for Ka at 25°C are typically in the range of 6 x 10⁻³ to 8 x 10⁻³.\n    Let's set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n    *   Initial [Fe³⁺] = 0.00936 M\n    *   Initial [H⁺] ≈ 0\n    *   At equilibrium, [H⁺] = x\n\n    The Ka expression is: Ka = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = x² / (0.00936 - x)\n    Using a representative Ka value of 6.3 x 10⁻³, we can solve for x:\n    6.3 x 10⁻³ = x² / (0.00936 - x)\n    Solving the quadratic equation gives x = [H⁺] ≈ 0.00515 M.\n    pH = -log(0.00515) ≈ 2.29.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    Our calculated volume (28.07 cm³) matches option B (28.05 cm³).\n    Our calculated pH (~2.3) is reasonably close to the pH in option B (2.04). The discrepancy is likely due to the specific Ka value(s) assumed by the problem, which might also account for the second hydrolysis step, making the solution more acidic (lower pH). The pH values in the other options are not consistent with the chemical principles. For instance, the pH in option A (2.69) is too high to allow for the complete dissolution of 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n\nTherefore, the pair of values in option B is the most chemically consistent answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum amount of strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, and the pH of the resulting 100 cm³ solution. This involves stoichiometry and equilibrium calculations.\n\n**1. Gather Necessary Constants:**\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** The sum of the atomic masses of its elements (Fe, O, H) is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n*   **Solubility Product Constant (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃:** This value indicates the equilibrium of a solid dissolving in water. There is a range of reported values; a common one is 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹, while others are around 1.6 x 10⁻³⁹ or 10⁻³⁶.⁴. For this calculation, we will use the principle that dissolution requires a specific final pH, which depends on the Ksp.\n*   **Acid Dissociation Constant (Ka) for Fe³⁺(aq):** The hydrated iron(III) ion, [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺, acts as an acid. Its pKa is reported to be around 2.2 to 2.46, which means it is a relatively strong acid among metal aqua ions. A pKa of 2.2 corresponds to a Ka of 10⁻²·² ≈ 6.31 x 10⁻³.\n\n**2. Stoichiometric Calculation of Acid Volume:**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved:\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\nThe dissolution reaction with a strong monobasic acid (providing H⁺ ions) is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFrom the stoichiometry, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺.\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\nNow, calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed to provide these moles of H⁺:\n*   Volume of acid = Moles of H⁺ / Concentration = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L ≈ 0.02807 L\n*   Converting to cm³: 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = **28.07 cm³**\n\nThis calculation gives the volume of acid needed just to neutralize the hydroxide from Fe(OH)₃.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Final pH:**\n\nAfter dissolution, the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution contains the Fe³⁺ ions produced.\n*   Concentration of Fe³⁺ = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ / Total Volume = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\nThe Fe³⁺ ion hydrolyzes in water, acting as an acid and establishing an equilibrium:\n[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\nWe can use the Ka for this reaction (Ka ≈ 6.31 x 10⁻³) to find the resulting H⁺ concentration. Let 'x' be the concentration of H⁺ at equilibrium.\nKa = [H⁺][Fe(OH)²⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = (x)(x) / (9.357 x 10⁻³ - x)\n\nSince Ka is relatively large, we solve the quadratic equation:\nx² + (6.31 x 10⁻³)x - (6.31 x 10⁻³)(9.357 x 10⁻³) = 0\nx² + 0.00631x - 5.904 x 10⁻⁵ = 0\n\nSolving this gives x ≈ 5.19 x 10⁻³ M.\n*   x = [H⁺]\n\nNow, calculate the pH:\n*   pH = -log₁₀[H⁺] = -log₁₀(5.19 x 10⁻³) ≈ **2.28**\n\n**4. Re-evaluation and Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated values are approximately 28.07 cm³ for the acid volume and a pH of 2.28. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\nB) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nC) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\nD) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n\nOur calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the volume in option A (28.05 cm³). The calculated pH (2.28) is also closest to the pH in option A (2.04). The minor difference in pH can be attributed to variations in the published Ka value for the Fe³⁺ aqua ion and the fact that the final solution contains a small amount of unreacted H⁺ from the acid addition, which would lower the pH slightly from our hydrolysis-only calculation. If we consider the H⁺ from hydrolysis (5.19 x 10⁻³ M) and add it to any potential excess H⁺, the pH would indeed be lower than 2.28.\n\nThe problem asks for the *minimum* volume of acid. The stoichiometric amount is the absolute minimum required for the neutralization reaction. The resulting acidic solution from the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ ensures that the equilibrium is shifted far towards the dissolved state, satisfying the condition. Therefore, the stoichiometric approach is the most direct interpretation.\n\nBased on the calculations, the volume of acid required is approximately 28.05 cm³, and the resulting solution will have a pH of around 2.04.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nTo dissolve iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, which is a sparingly soluble base, we need to add a strong acid. The acid provides H+ ions that react with the hydroxide ions (OH-) from the Fe(OH)3, shifting the equilibrium towards dissolution.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)3**\n\nFirst, we determine how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we are trying to dissolve.\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 * (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of Acid (H+) Required**\n\nThe added acid serves two purposes:\n*   **Reaction:** To react with and neutralize the Fe(OH)3. According to the stoichiometry (1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+), the moles of H+ needed for the reaction are:\n    Moles H+ (reaction) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 0.0009357 mol = 0.002807 moles\n*   **Maintaining Acidity:** To keep the final solution acidic enough to prevent the Fe(OH)3 from precipitating back out. The amount of H+ remaining in the solution determines the final pH.\n    Moles H+ (remaining) = [H+]_final * Total Volume = 10^(-pH) * 0.1 L\n\nTherefore, the total moles of H+ that must be added from the 0.1 M acid is:\nTotal Moles H+ = Moles H+ (reaction) + Moles H+ (remaining)\n\n**4. Test the Given Options**\n\nWe can now check which of the multiple-choice options is consistent. For each option, we calculate the moles of H+ supplied by the given volume of acid and compare it to the total moles of H+ required for that pH.\n\n*   **Moles of H+ supplied** = Volume of acid (in L) * 0.1 M\n\nLet's test **Option B (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3)**:\n\n*   **Volume of acid:** 30.09 cm3 = 0.03009 L\n*   **Moles of H+ supplied:** 0.03009 L * 0.1 M = **0.003009 moles**\n\nNow, let's calculate the total moles of H+ required to achieve a pH of 2.69:\n\n*   **Moles H+ (reaction):** 0.002807 moles (calculated above)\n*   **Moles H+ (remaining):** 10^(-2.69) * 0.1 L = 0.002042 * 0.1 = 0.0002042 moles\n*   **Total Moles H+ required:** 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = **0.003011 moles**\n\nThe moles of H+ supplied (0.003009) are almost identical to the total moles of H+ required (0.003011). This small difference is due to rounding in the problem's options. This shows that Option B is chemically and mathematically consistent. Testing the other options reveals significant inconsistencies.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a two-part calculation: first, determining the volume of acid needed, and second, finding the pH of the final solution.\n\n### **Part 1: Calculating the Minimum Volume of Acid**\n\n1.  **Reaction Stoichiometry:** The dissolution of solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) is a neutralization reaction. The balanced chemical equation is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n    This equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n2.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** To find the moles of Fe(OH)₃, we first need its molar mass.\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\n    Now, we can calculate the moles from the given mass (0.1 g):\n    Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol\n\n3.  **Moles of Acid (H⁺):** Based on the stoichiometry (1:3 ratio), we can find the moles of H⁺ required to react completely with the Fe(OH)₃. The \"minimum volume\" is interpreted as the stoichiometric amount needed for this reaction.\n    Moles of H⁺ = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.00280725 mol\n\n4.  **Volume of Acid:** The acid is a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid. We can find the required volume using the concentration formula (Volume = Moles / Concentration).\n    Volume of acid (L) = 0.00280725 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280725 L\n    Converting liters to cubic centimeters (1 L = 1000 cm³):\n    Volume of acid (cm³) = 0.0280725 L × 1000 cm³/L ≈ **28.07 cm³**\n\nThis calculated volume is extremely close to the value of 28.05 cm³ given in option B.\n\n### **Part 2: Calculating the pH of the Resulting Solution**\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Condition:** For the Fe(OH)₃ to be completely dissolved, the ion concentrations in the solution must satisfy the solubility product (Ksp) equilibrium:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\n2.  **Concentration of Fe³⁺:** When 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ dissolves in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L), the concentration of Fe³⁺ is:\n    [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ / Total Volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.00936 M\n\n3.  **Finding the pH:** The pH of the solution determines the hydroxide concentration ([OH⁻]) through the autoionization of water (Kw = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C). We need to find the pH at which the Ksp expression is satisfied for the calculated [Fe³⁺]. Instead of assuming a Ksp value, we can test the pH from option B.\n    *   If pH = 2.04, then [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M.\n    *   pOH = 14.00 - pH = 14.00 - 2.04 = 11.96\n    *   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.⁹⁶ M\n\n4.  **Verification:** Let's check if these concentrations are consistent with a known Ksp value for Fe(OH)₃.\n    Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (0.00936) × (10⁻¹¹.⁹⁶)³ ≈ 1.23 × 10⁻³⁸\n    This calculated Ksp value of 1.23 × 10⁻³⁸ is well within the accepted range of literature values for Fe(OH)₃ (typically 10⁻³⁸ to 10⁻³⁹). This confirms that a pH of 2.04 is the correct equilibrium pH required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in the given volume.\n\nThe calculated volume (28.07 cm³) and the verification of the pH (2.04) both strongly support option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to find a self-consistent pair of values: the volume of strong acid needed and the final pH of the solution after dissolving 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃. The most direct way to solve this is to use the principle of mass balance for the hydrogen ions (H⁺) provided by the acid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Chemical Reaction Stoichiometry:**\n    First, we write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, a base, in a strong acid (represented by H⁺):\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This equation shows that **3 moles of H⁺** are consumed for every **1 mole of Fe(OH)₃** that dissolves.\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    Next, we determine the number of moles in the 0.1 g sample of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated from the atomic masses of its elements (Fe ≈ 55.845 g/mol, O ≈ 15.999 g/mol, H ≈ 1.008 g/mol).\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n3.  **Hydrogen Ion (H⁺) Mass Balance:**\n    The total amount of H⁺ added from the 0.1 M acid is partitioned into two parts:\n    a.  **H⁺ that reacts with Fe(OH)₃:** Based on the stoichiometry from Step 1.\n        *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.00280725 mol.\n    b.  **H⁺ that remains in the solution:** This excess H⁺ determines the final pH of the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution.\n        *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = Final [H⁺] × Total Volume = 10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L.\n\n4.  **Relating Acid Volume to pH:**\n    The total moles of H⁺ added is the sum of the reacted and remaining parts.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    The volume of the 0.1 M acid required to deliver this total amount of H⁺ is given by:\n    *   Volume of Acid (L) = Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M\n    *   Volume of Acid (cm³) = 1000 × (Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M)\n\n5.  **Testing the Options for Self-Consistency:**\n    The correct answer must be the (pH, Volume) pair that satisfies the mass balance equation derived above. We can test each option by plugging in the given pH, calculating the required acid volume, and checking if it matches the volume given in that option. A Python script is used for precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants and Initial Calculations ---\n# Molar Mass of Fe(OH)3 (g/mol)\nMM_FeOH3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008)\n\n# Moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved\nmoles_FeOH3 = 0.1 / MM_FeOH3\n\n# Moles of H+ needed to react with Fe(OH)3 based on stoichiometry\nmoles_H_reacted = 3 * moles_FeOH3\n\n# Total volume of the final solution (L)\nV_total_L = 0.1  # 100 cm3\n\n# Concentration of the strong acid (M)\nC_acid = 0.1\n\n# --- Function to test an option for self-consistency ---\ndef check_option(ph, expected_volume_cm3):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the required acid volume based on the given pH and compares\n    it to the expected volume from the option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate moles of H+ remaining in the solution for the given pH\n    moles_H_remaining = (10**(-ph)) * V_total_L\n    \n    # Calculate the total moles of H+ that must have been added\n    total_moles_H_added = moles_H_reacted + moles_H_remaining\n    \n    # Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed to provide this total amount of H+\n    calculated_volume_L = total_moles_H_added / C_acid\n    calculated_volume_cm3 = calculated_volume_L * 1000\n    \n    print(f\"--- Testing Option (pH={ph}, Volume={expected_volume_cm3} cm3) ---\")\n    print(f\"Calculated acid volume needed: {calculated_volume_cm3:.2f} cm3\")\n    print(f\"Expected acid volume from option: {expected_volume_cm3:.2f} cm3\")\n    \n    # Check if the calculated and expected volumes match\n    if math.isclose(calculated_volume_cm3, expected_volume_cm3, rel_tol=1e-3): # 0.1% tolerance for rounding\n        print(\"Result: This option is self-consistent.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Result: This option is NOT self-consistent.\\n\")\n\n# --- Test all given options ---\ncheck_option(ph=3.16, expected_volume_cm3=32.14) # Option A\ncheck_option(ph=2.04, expected_volume_cm3=28.05) # Option B\ncheck_option(ph=2.69, expected_volume_cm3=30.09) # Option C\ncheck_option(ph=4.94, expected_volume_cm3=20.40) # Option D\n```\n```output\n--- Testing Option (pH=3.16, Volume=32.14 cm3) ---\nCalculated acid volume needed: 28.76 cm3\nExpected acid volume from option: 32.14 cm3\nResult: This option is NOT self-consistent.\n\n--- Testing Option (pH=2.04, Volume=28.05 cm3) ---\nCalculated acid volume needed: 37.19 cm3\nExpected acid volume from option: 28.05 cm3\nResult: This option is NOT self-consistent.\n\n--- Testing Option (pH=2.69, Volume=30.09 cm3) ---\nCalculated acid volume needed: 30.11 cm3\nExpected acid volume from option: 30.09 cm3\nResult: This option is self-consistent.\n\n--- Testing Option (pH=4.94, Volume=20.40 cm3) ---\nCalculated acid volume needed: 28.08 cm3\nExpected acid volume from option: 20.40 cm3\nResult: This option is NOT self-consistent.\n\n```\n### Conclusion\nThe calculation shows that only for Option C does the given pH (2.69) lead to a calculated acid volume (30.11 cm³) that closely matches the volume provided in the option (30.09 cm³).

This is a two-part problem.\n\n### Part 1: Calculating the Minimum Volume of Acid\n\nThe dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide in a strong acid is represented by the following chemical equation:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe \"minimum volume\" is generally interpreted as the stoichiometric amount of acid required for the reaction to go to completion.\n\n1.  **Calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   M(Fe) = 55.845 g/mol\n    *   M(O) = 15.999 g/mol\n    *   M(H) = 1.008 g/mol\n    *   M(Fe(OH)₃) = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved:**\n    *   Mass = 0.1 g\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol\n\n3.  **Determine the moles of H⁺ required:**\n    *   From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.00280725 mol\n\n4.  **Calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid:**\n    *   Concentration of acid = 0.1 mol/L\n    *   Volume (L) = Moles / Concentration = 0.00280725 mol / 0.1 mol/L ≈ 0.02807 L\n    *   Convert volume to cm³: Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L × 1000 cm³/L ≈ 28.07 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the value of 28.05 cm³ provided in option D. The other options are not close. This strongly suggests that this stoichiometric calculation is the intended method for finding the volume.\n\n### Part 2: Calculating the pH of the Resulting Solution\n\nAfter the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The Fe³⁺ ion is acidic and hydrolyzes in water, which lowers the pH.\n\n1.  **Calculate the concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.00936 M\n\n2.  **Consider the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺:**\n    *   The primary hydrolysis reaction is: Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n    *   The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction is approximately 6.3 × 10⁻³.\n\n3.  **Calculate the equilibrium [H⁺] and pH:**\n    *   Using an ICE table, we get the expression: Ka = [H⁺]² / ([Fe³⁺] - [H⁺])\n    *   6.3 × 10⁻³ = x² / (0.00936 - x), where x = [H⁺]\n    *   Solving the resulting quadratic equation (x² + 6.3×10⁻³x - 5.9×10⁻⁵ = 0) gives x ≈ 0.00515 M.\n    *   pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.00515) ≈ 2.29\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOur calculations give:\n*   **Volume ≈ 28.07 cm³**\n*   **pH ≈ 2.29**\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\nA) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nB) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\nC) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nD) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n\nThe calculated volume (28.07 cm³) matches option D (28.05 cm³) almost perfectly. However, our calculated pH (2.29) does not match the pH in option D (2.04).\n\nThis discrepancy is common in complex chemistry problems presented in a multiple-choice format. The calculation for the volume is based on a simple, robust stoichiometric principle. The calculation for pH is more sensitive and depends on the specific equilibrium constants (Ksp, Ka) used and the complexity of the model (e.g., including multiple hydrolysis steps).\n\nGiven the excellent agreement for the volume, it is most likely that the question intends for the student to identify the correct option based on the straightforward stoichiometric calculation. The pH value of 2.04 is the other part of the correct answer pair, even though it doesn't align with a simple hydrolysis calculation.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is the one that matches our reliable volume calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the chemical problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\nTo dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, we must add an acid. The strong acid provides H+ ions that react with the hydroxide ions (OH-) from the Fe(OH)3, shifting the solubility equilibrium to the right.\n\nThe primary reaction is:\nFe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n\nHowever, once the iron is in solution as the hydrated ion [Fe(H2O)6]3+ (abbreviated as Fe3+), it acts as a weak acid itself, hydrolyzing water and establishing another equilibrium:\nFe3+(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ [Fe(OH)(H2O)5]2+(aq) + H+(aq) (simplified as Fe(OH)2+)\n\nThe \"minimum volume\" of acid corresponds to creating a solution with the highest possible pH (least amount of excess acid) at which all the Fe(OH)3 has just dissolved. This final pH is determined by a balance between the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3 and the acid dissociation constant (Ka) of the aqueous Fe3+ ion.\n\n**2. List Knowns and Constants**\n\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g\n*   Total solution volume (V_total) = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n*   Acid concentration (C_acid) = 0.1 M\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol\n*   Solubility Product of Fe(OH)3 (Ksp) at 25°C ≈ 2.7 x 10⁻³⁹ (a common literature value)\n*   Acid Dissociation Constant for [Fe(H2O)6]3+ (Ka) ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻³ (pKa ≈ 2.2)\n*   Ion Product for Water (Kw) = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Concentration of Iron**\n\nFirst, we find the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 and its total concentration if it all dissolves.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol = 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n*   Total Iron Concentration [Fe_total] = Moles / V_total = 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L = 9.356 x 10⁻³ M\n\n**4. Determine the pH of the Resulting Solution**\n\nAt the point of minimum dissolution, the solution is saturated. The final pH ([H+]) is dictated by the interplay of Ksp and Ka. The relationship can be derived as follows:\n\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n[Fe_total] = [Fe³⁺] + [Fe(OH)²⁺]\nKa = ([Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺]) / [Fe³⁺]\nKw = [H⁺][OH⁻]\n\nBy combining these four equations, we can derive a single equation to solve for the final [H⁺]:\nKsp = ( [Fe_total] × Kw³ ) / ( [H⁺]³ + Ka × [H⁺]² )\n\nPlugging in the values:\n2.7 x 10⁻³⁹ = ( (9.356 x 10⁻³) × (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)³ ) / ( [H⁺]³ + (6.3 x 10⁻³) × [H⁺]² )\n2.7 x 10⁻³⁹ = ( 9.356 x 10⁻⁴⁵ ) / ( [H⁺]³ + 0.0063 × [H⁺]² )\n[H⁺]³ + 0.0063 × [H⁺]² = 9.356 x 10⁻⁴⁵ / 2.7 x 10⁻³⁹\n[H⁺]³ + 0.0063 × [H⁺]² = 3.465 x 10⁻⁶\n\nWe can solve this cubic equation for [H⁺]. A good approach is to test the pH values given in the options.\nLet's test the pH from option D: pH = 3.16\n[H⁺] = 10⁻³.¹⁶ ≈ 6.92 x 10⁻⁴ M\n\nSubstitute this into the left side of the equation:\n(6.92 x 10⁻⁴)³ + 0.0063 × (6.92 x 10⁻⁴)² ≈ (3.3 x 10⁻¹⁰) + (3.0 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 3.3 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThis value (3.3 x 10⁻⁶) is very close to the required value of 3.465 x 10⁻⁶. This confirms that the pH of the resulting solution is indeed **3.16**.\n\n**5. Determine the Minimum Volume of Acid**\n\nThe most accurate way to determine the volume of acid added is to use the principle of charge neutrality for the final solution. The sum of all positive charges must equal the sum of all negative charges. Let A⁻ be the anion from the strong acid (e.g., Cl⁻).\n\nCharge Balance: 3[Fe³⁺] + 2[Fe(OH)²⁺] + [H⁺] = [A⁻] + [OH⁻]\n\nWe need to find the concentrations of the iron species at pH 3.16.\n*   [H⁺] = 6.92 x 10⁻⁴ M\n*   [Fe³⁺] = [Fe_total] / (1 + Ka/[H⁺]) = (9.356 x 10⁻³) / (1 + (6.3 x 10⁻³)/(6.92 x 10⁻⁴)) ≈ 9.26 x 10⁻⁴ M\n*   [Fe(OH)²⁺] = [Fe_total] - [Fe³⁺] = (9.356 x 10⁻³) - (9.26 x 10⁻⁴) ≈ 8.43 x 10⁻³ M\n*   [OH⁻] is negligible at this pH.\n\nNow, we solve for [A⁻], which is the final concentration of the acid's anion:\n[A⁻] ≈ 3(9.26 x 10⁻⁴) + 2(8.43 x 10⁻³) + (6.92 x 10⁻⁴)\n[A⁻] ≈ 0.00278 + 0.01686 + 0.000692 ≈ 0.02033 M\n\nThe moles of acid added are equal to the moles of A⁻ in the solution:\nMoles of Acid = [A⁻] × V_total = 0.02033 M × 0.1 L = 0.002033 mol\n\nFinally, calculate the initial volume of the 0.1 M acid:\nVolume of Acid = Moles / Concentration = 0.002033 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02033 L = **20.33 cm³**\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe detailed calculation yields:\n*   pH = 3.16\n*   Volume = 20.33 cm³\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nB) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\nC) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nD) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n\nOur calculated pH of 3.16 perfectly matches option D. Our calculated volume of 20.33 cm³ is very close to the volume in option A (20.40 cm³). This indicates a likely inconsistency in the question's options, where the correct pH is paired with an incorrect volume. However, the pH calculation is complex and specific, making it the most probable intended correct answer. The volume in option D (32.14 cm³) is inconsistent with the principles of charge balance for the given pH. Therefore, selecting the option with the correct pH is the most logical choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user wants me to solve a quantitative chemistry problem.

It's likely a calculation for a different reaction.\n\nThe values are clustered in the `10^-36` to `10^-39` range. This is a huge range, and the final pH will be very sensitive to this value. Let's try a few values to see how much the result changes. A common textbook value is around `2.8 x 10^-39`. Another one is `4 x 10^-38`. Let's use a value from the search results, `1.1 x 10^-36`, as it's explicitly stated for 25°C. Let's also try `2.79 x 10^-39` which is also a plausible value.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation using `Ksp = 2.79 x 10^-39` as it is a frequently cited value in literature and textbooks. If the result doesn't match any of the options, I will recalculate with another Ksp value.\n\n**Step-by-step Calculation**\n\n**1. Molar Mass and Moles of Fe(OH)3**\n*   Molar Mass = 106.87 g/mol\n*   Mass = 0.1 g\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol\n\n**2. Concentration of Fe³⁺**\n*   The Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in a total volume of 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n*   [Fe³⁺] = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M\n\n**3. Equilibrium [OH⁻] and pH**\n*   The dissolution equilibrium is: `Fe(OH)3(s) <=> Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)`\n*   The solubility product expression is: `Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³`\n*   We are at the point where all the solid has just dissolved, so we can use the Ksp to find the maximum [OH⁻] allowed in the solution.\n*   Let's use `Ksp = 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹`\n*   `2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ = (0.009357) * [OH⁻]³`\n*   `[OH⁻]³ = (2.79 x 10⁻³⁹) / 0.009357 = 2.982 x 10⁻³⁷`\n*   `[OH⁻] = (2.982 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) = 6.68 x 10⁻¹³ M`\n*   `pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.68 x 10⁻¹³) = 12.18`\n*   `pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.18 = 1.82`\n\nThis pH value (1.82) is quite different from the options. Let's try another Ksp value, for example, `4.0 x 10⁻³⁸`.\n*   `[OH⁻]³ = (4.0 x 10⁻³⁸) / 0.009357 = 4.275 x 10⁻³⁶`\n*   `[OH⁻] = (4.275 x 10⁻³⁶)^(1/3) = 1.623 x 10⁻¹² M`\n*   `pOH = -log₁₀(1.623 x 10⁻¹²) = 11.79`\n*   `pH = 14 - 11.79 = 2.21`\nThis is getting closer to option B (pH 2.04).\n\nLet's try `Ksp = 1.0 x 10⁻³⁸`.\n*   `[OH⁻]³ = (1.0 x 10⁻³⁸) / 0.009357 = 1.069 x 10⁻³⁶`\n*   `[OH⁻] = (1.069 x 10⁻³⁶)^(1/3) = 1.022 x 10⁻¹² M`\n*   `pOH = -log₁₀(1.022 x 10⁻¹²) = 11.99`\n*   `pH = 14 - 11.99 = 2.01`\nThis is very close to pH 2.04. The Ksp value is likely in this range. Let's work backwards from the pH of option B to see what Ksp it implies.\n\n**Let's assume pH = 2.04 (from option B) is correct and calculate the required acid volume.**\n\n**4. Required Volume of Acid (assuming pH = 2.04)**\n*   If the final pH is 2.04, then the final concentration of H⁺ is:\n    *   `[H⁺]_final = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ = 0.00912 M`\n*   The overall reaction is: `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) -> Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n*   The total moles of H⁺ added from the acid must account for two things:\n    1.  The moles of H⁺ that react with the OH⁻ from Fe(OH)₃.\n    2.  The moles of H⁺ that remain in the solution to create the final pH.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.0009357 mol.\n*   Moles of H⁺ reacted = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.002807 mol.\n*   Moles of H⁺ remaining in the 0.1 L solution = `[H⁺]_final * Volume` = 0.00912 M * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\n*   Total moles of H⁺ added = Moles reacted + Moles remaining\n    *   Total moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\n*   This total amount of H⁺ comes from the 0.1 M strong acid.\n    *   Volume of acid = Total moles H⁺ / Concentration of acid\n    *   Volume of acid (L) = 0.003719 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03719 L.\n*   Volume of acid (cm³) = 0.03719 L * 1000 cm³/L = 37.19 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume in option B (28.05 cm³). There must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"Total moles of H+ added\".\n\nThe total moles of H+ added is `C_acid * V_acid = 0.1 * V_acid`.\nThe final concentration of H+ is `[H+]_final`.\nThe final concentration of Fe3+ is `[Fe3+]_final`.\n\nLet `V_a` be the volume of acid in Liters.\nTotal moles of H+ added = `0.1 * V_a`.\nTotal moles of Fe(OH)3 = `n_Fe = 0.0009357` mol.\n\nIn the final solution (volume = 0.1 L):\nMoles of H+ reacted = `3 * n_Fe = 0.002807` mol.\nMoles of H+ unreacted = `[H+]_final * 0.1`.\nTotal moles H+ = `0.1 * V_a`.\n\nThis seems correct. Let's re-check the calculation.\npH = 2.04 -> [H+] = 10^-2.04 = 0.00912 M.\nMoles H+ remaining = 0.00912 M * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\nMoles H+ reacted = 3 * (0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol) = 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.002807 mol.\nTotal moles H+ needed = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\nVolume of 0.1 M acid = 0.003719 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³.\n\nThis still doesn't match. Let's check the other options.\n\nWhat if the question implies that the volume of the acid is NOT part of the final 100 cm³? The wording \"dissolve ... in 100 cm3 total volume\" suggests it is. But let's test the alternative.\nIf the final volume is `100 cm³ + V_acid`, the calculation becomes more complex.\n`V_total = 0.1 + V_a`\n`[H+]_final = (moles_H+_added - moles_H+_reacted) / V_total`\n`0.00912 = (0.1 * V_a - 0.002807) / (0.1 + V_a)`\n`0.000912 + 0.00912 * V_a = 0.1 * V_a - 0.002807`\n`0.003719 = (0.1 - 0.00912) * V_a = 0.09088 * V_a`\n`V_a = 0.003719 / 0.09088 = 0.04092 L = 40.92 cm³`. Still not matching.\n\nLet's go back to the initial assumption: Total Volume = 100 cm³.\nThere must be something I am missing. Let's re-read the question carefully.\n\"dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?\"\n\nLet's re-calculate everything from scratch, being very precise.\n\n**1. Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n*   Molar Mass Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3*(15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**2. Stoichiometric H⁺ required**\n*   Reaction: Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O\n*   Moles H⁺ needed for reaction = 3 * (9.3575 x 10⁻⁴) = 2.80725 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n**3. Final concentrations**\n*   Total Volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n*   [Fe³⁺] = (9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.3575 x 10⁻³ M\n\n**4. Equilibrium pH**\n*   The solution is at equilibrium when all 0.1g is dissolved.\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n*   Let's try to find a Ksp value that leads to one of the pH values in the options.\n    *   Option A: pH = 2.69 -> pOH = 11.31 -> [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹·³¹ = 4.898 x 10⁻¹² M\n    *   Option B: pH = 2.04 -> pOH = 11.96 -> [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹·⁹⁶ = 1.096 x 10⁻¹² M\n    *   Option C: pH = 4.94 -> pOH = 9.06 -> [OH⁻] = 10⁻⁹·⁰⁶ = 8.710 x 10⁻¹⁰ M\n    *   Option D: pH = 3.16 -> pOH = 10.84 -> [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹⁰·⁸⁴ = 1.445 x 10⁻¹¹ M\n\n*   Let's calculate the implied Ksp for each option: Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.3575 x 10⁻³) * [OH⁻]³\n    *   Option A: Ksp = (9.3575 x 10⁻³) * (4.898 x 10⁻¹²)³ = 1.10 x 10⁻³⁶\n    *   Option B: Ksp = (9.3575 x 10⁻³) * (1.096 x 10⁻¹²)³ = 1.23 x 10⁻³⁸\n    *   Option C: Ksp = (9.3575 x 10⁻³) * (8.710 x 10⁻¹⁰)³ = 6.17 x 10⁻³⁰\n    *   Option D: Ksp = (9.3575 x 10⁻³) * (1.445 x 10⁻¹¹)³ = 2.82 x 10⁻³⁵\n\n*   The Ksp values from the literature search were in the range 10⁻³⁶ to 10⁻³⁹.\n    *   The Ksp implied by Option A (`1.10 x 10⁻³⁶`) is very plausible and matches one of the search results exactly.\n    *   The Ksp implied by Option B (`1.23 x 10⁻³⁸`) is also plausible.\n    *   The Ksp for Option D is a bit high but possible.\n    *   The Ksp for Option C is too high to be realistic for Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   Let's assume Option A is the correct one and calculate the required volume of acid.\n    *   pH = 2.69\n    *   [H⁺]_final = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ = 2.042 x 10⁻³ M\n    *   Moles H⁺ remaining = [H⁺]_final * Volume = (2.042 x 10⁻³ M) * 0.1 L = 2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n    *   Moles H⁺ reacted = 2.80725 x 10⁻³ mol (from step 2)\n    *   Total moles H⁺ needed = (2.80725 x 10⁻³) + (2.042 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.01145 x 10⁻³ mol\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M acid = (3.01145 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0301145 L\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 30.11 cm³\n\n*   This calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is extremely close to the volume in Option A (30.09 cm³). The minor difference is likely due to rounding of molar mass or other constants.\n\nLet's re-check the calculation for Option B just to be sure.\n*   pH = 2.04\n*   [H⁺]_final = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ = 9.120 x 10⁻³ M\n*   Moles H⁺ remaining = (9.120 x 10⁻³ M) * 0.1 L = 9.120 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n*   Moles H⁺ reacted = 2.80725 x 10⁻³ mol\n*   Total moles H⁺ needed = (2.80725 x 10⁻³) + (9.120 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.71925 x 10⁻³ mol\n*   Volume of 0.1 M acid = (3.71925 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³\n*   This (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume in Option B (28.05 cm³).\n\nThe calculations strongly support Option A. The logic is sound:\n1.  Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.\n2.  For each potential answer (pH, Volume), calculate the Ksp that the pH implies.\n3.  Check if this Ksp is a reasonable value for Fe(OH)₃.\n4.  For the same potential answer, calculate the total moles of acid required (moles to react + moles to remain to establish the pH).\n5.  From the total moles of acid, calculate the required volume of the 0.1 M acid solution.\n6.  If the calculated volume matches the volume given in the option, that is the correct answer.\n\nThe pair of values in Option A (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³) are consistent with each other based on a Ksp value of ~1.1 x 10⁻³⁶, which is a literature-supported value. The other options are not internally consistent.\n\nFinal check of the calculation for A:\n*   Moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 / 106.87 = 0.0009357 mol\n*   Moles H+ reacted = 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.0028071 mol\n*   Final [H+] from pH 2.69 = 10^-2.69 = 0.0020417 M\n*   Moles H+ remaining in 0.1 L = 0.0020417 * 0.1 = 0.00020417 mol\n*   Total moles H+ = 0.0028071 + 0.00020417 = 0.00301127 mol\n*   Volume of 0.1 M acid = 0.00301127 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0301127 L\n*   Volume in cm3 = 30.11 cm³\nThis matches option A (30.09 cm³) very well. The small discrepancy is due to rounding differences in the molar mass or the given values in the option.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molar Mass and Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we calculate the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe = 55.85 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of O = 16.00 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of H = 1.01 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol = 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**2. Write the Chemical Reaction**\n\nTo dissolve the sparingly soluble Fe(OH)₃, the added strong acid (let's denote it as H⁺) neutralizes the hydroxide ions (OH⁻), shifting the dissolution equilibrium to the right.\n*   Dissolution: Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n*   Neutralization: 3H⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq) → 3H₂O(l)\n*   Overall Reaction: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFrom the overall reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ for the stoichiometric reaction.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final Solution**\n\nThe problem states the total volume of the final solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The acid added serves two purposes:\n*   To react completely with the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   To leave a certain amount of excess H⁺ ions that will determine the final pH of the solution.\n\nWe will test the provided options to see which one is chemically consistent. Let's analyze Option A.\n\n**4. Test Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Step 4a: Calculate the excess H⁺ moles from the pH.**\n    If the final pH is 2.69, the concentration of H⁺ in the solution is:\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.00204 M\n    The number of excess H⁺ moles remaining in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution is:\n    *   Moles of excess H⁺ = [H⁺] * Volume = 0.00204 mol/L * 0.1 L = 2.04 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n*   **Step 4b: Calculate the H⁺ moles needed for the reaction.**\n    From step 1, we have 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol of Fe(OH)₃. Based on the 1:3 stoichiometry:\n    *   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 * (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Step 4c: Calculate the total H⁺ moles and the required acid volume.**\n    The total moles of H⁺ that must be added is the sum of the moles for the reaction and the excess moles.\n    *   Total H⁺ moles = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (2.04 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.011 x 10⁻³ mol\n    The volume of a 0.1 M strong acid needed to provide these moles is:\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = (3.011 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03011 L\n    *   Converting to cm³: Volume = 0.03011 L * 1000 cm³/L = 30.11 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ is in excellent agreement with the volume of 30.09 cm³ given in Option A. The minor difference is due to rounding of constants.\n\n**5. Verify the Equilibrium Condition (Optional)**\n\nWe can also verify that the pH of 2.69 is consistent with the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   At pH 2.69, pOH = 14 - 2.69 = 11.31\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹·³¹ M\n*   [Fe³⁺] = (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.356 x 10⁻³ M\n*   The ion product Qsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.356 x 10⁻³)(10⁻¹¹·³¹)³ ≈ 1.1 x 10⁻³⁶\nThis calculated Qsp value matches known literature values for the Ksp of Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C, confirming that the solution would be at saturation.\n\nThe values in Option A are consistent with the principles of stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium. A similar analysis of the other options shows they are not internally consistent.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Calculating the Minimum Volume of Acid\n\n1.  **Reaction Stoichiometry:**\n    First, we need to write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a strong monobasic acid (represented by H⁺). Fe(OH)₃ is a base and reacts with the acid in a neutralization reaction.\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n\n2.  **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    We calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ using the atomic masses of its constituent elements (Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol, O ≈ 16.00 g/mol, H ≈ 1.01 g/mol).\n    Molar Mass = 55.85 + 3 × (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\n3.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    The problem states we are dissolving 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 moles.\n\n4.  **Moles of H⁺ Required:**\n    Using the stoichiometry from step 1, we find the moles of H⁺ needed.\n    Moles of H⁺ = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 moles.\n\n5.  **Volume of Acid:**\n    The acid is a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. The minimum volume needed is the volume that contains 0.002807 moles of H⁺.\n    Volume (L) = Moles / Concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L.\n    To convert this to cm³, we multiply by 1000.\n    Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L × 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the volume given in option C (28.05 cm³).\n\n### Part 2: Calculating the pH of the Resulting Solution\n\n1.  **Concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    After dissolution, the 0.0009356 moles of Fe³⁺ are in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009356 M.\n\n2.  **Hydrolysis of Fe³⁺:**\n    The iron(III) ion is a Lewis acid and hydrolyzes in water, producing H⁺ ions and making the solution acidic. The hydrated ion [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ acts as a weak acid.\n    [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Calculation:**\n    To find the pH, we need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction. Published pKa values for [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ are typically around 2.1 to 2.5. Let's use a common value, pKa = 2.2, which corresponds to Ka = 10⁻²·² ≈ 6.31 × 10⁻³.\n\n    We set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n| Species | [Fe³⁺] | [Fe(OH)²⁺] | [H₃O⁺] |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Initial | 0.009356 | 0 | 0 |\n| Change | -x | +x | +x |\n| Equilibrium| 0.009356 - x | x | x |\n\n    The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H₃O⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = x² / (0.009356 - x)\n\n    Substituting the values:\n    6.31 × 10⁻³ = x² / (0.009356 - x)\n\n    This requires solving a quadratic equation: x² + (6.31 × 10⁻³)x - 5.90 × 10⁻⁵ = 0.\n    Solving for x (which represents [H₃O⁺]) gives:\n    x ≈ 0.00515 M.\n\n4.  **Final pH:**\n    pH = -log₁₀([H₃O⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.00515) ≈ 2.29.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOur calculated values are:\n*   Volume ≈ 28.07 cm³\n*   pH ≈ 2.29\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n*   B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n*   C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n*   D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n\nThe calculated volume (28.07 cm³) matches option C (28.05 cm³) almost perfectly. The calculated pH (≈2.3) is in the same acidic range as option C's pH (2.04), although not identical.

    "This problem requires finding a self-consistent pair of values for the volume of acid added and the resulting pH of the solution. The most reliable method is to use the principle of mass balance for the hydrogen ions (H⁺).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry:**\n    To dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, a strong acid is added. The H⁺ ions from the acid serve two purposes:\n    a.  They react stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃.\n    b.  They remain in excess in the final solution, creating an acidic pH that prevents the Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating.\n\n2.  **Stoichiometric Calculation:**\n    *   First, write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n        Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    *   Next, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved. The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n        Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n    *   From the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of H⁺ that are consumed in the reaction are:\n        Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n3.  **Mass Balance Equation:**\n    The total amount of H⁺ added from the acid must equal the amount that reacted plus the amount that remains in the final solution.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n\n    This can be expressed as:\n    *   (Volume of Acid in L × 0.1 M) = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L)\n\n4.  **Testing the Options for Self-Consistency:**\n    We must check which of the given (pH, Volume) pairs satisfies the mass balance equation.\n\n    *   **Test Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n        *   **Left Side (H⁺ Added):** 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**\n        *   **Right Side (H⁺ Accounted For):**\n            *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol\n            *   Total = 0.002807 mol (reacted) + 0.000204 mol (remaining) = **0.003011 mol**\n        *   **Conclusion:** The amount of acid added (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the amount accounted for (0.003011 mol). This option is self-consistent.\n\n    *   **Test Option B: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n        *   **Left Side (H⁺ Added):** 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = **0.002805 mol**\n        *   **Right Side (H⁺ Accounted For):**\n            *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000912 mol\n            *   Total = 0.002807 mol (reacted) + 0.000912 mol (remaining) = **0.003719 mol**\n        *   **Conclusion:** The amount of acid added (0.002805 mol) is not equal to the amount required (0.003719 mol). In fact, the amount of acid added is less than the amount needed just for the reaction (0.002807 mol), making this option impossible.\n\n    *   **Test Option C: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n        *   **Left Side (H⁺ Added):** 0.02040 L × 0.1 M = **0.002040 mol**\n        *   **Conclusion:** The amount of acid added is far less than the 0.002807 mol required for the reaction. This option is impossible.\n\n    *   **Test Option D: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n        *   **Left Side (H⁺ Added):** 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = **0.003214 mol**\n        *   **Right Side (H⁺ Accounted For):**\n            *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol\n            *   Total = 0.002807 mol (reacted) + 0.000069 mol (remaining) = **0.002876 mol**\n        *   **Conclusion:** The values 0.003214 mol and 0.002876 mol are not consistent.\n\nOnly Option A provides a pair of values where the volume of acid added is sufficient to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given final pH.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Understand the Chemistry**\n\nTo dissolve iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, which is a sparingly soluble solid, we need to add an acid. The strong acid will react with the hydroxide component of Fe(OH)₃, shifting the dissolution equilibrium to the right. The overall reaction is:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe added acid serves two purposes:\n*   It provides the H⁺ ions needed to react stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   It provides the excess H⁺ ions required to remain in the solution to keep the final pH low enough to prevent the Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃. The dissolution is governed by the solubility product, Ksp: Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq). A low pH (high [H⁺]) ensures a very low [OH⁻], keeping the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ below Ksp.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)₃ we are trying to dissolve.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = M(Fe) + 3 × M(O) + 3 × M(H)\n    M(Fe(OH)₃) = 55.85 g/mol + 3 × 16.00 g/mol + 3 × 1.01 g/mol = 106.88 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / molar mass\n    Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 9.356 × 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n**3. Set up the Mass Balance Equation for the Acid (H⁺)**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid must equal the amount consumed in the reaction plus the amount remaining in the final solution.\n\nTotal Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Consumed + Moles H⁺ Remaining\n\n*   **Moles H⁺ Consumed:** From the stoichiometry (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺), 3 moles of H⁺ are consumed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles H⁺ Consumed = 3 × (moles of Fe(OH)₃) = 3 × (9.356 × 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 × 10⁻³ mol.\n\n*   **Moles H⁺ Remaining:** This is the amount of H⁺ in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution, which determines its pH.\n    Moles H⁺ Remaining = [H⁺]final × Vtotal = [H⁺]final × 0.1 L.\n    Since pH = -log[H⁺], we have [H⁺]final = 10⁻pH.\n    Moles H⁺ Remaining = (10⁻pH) × 0.1 L.\n\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:** This comes from the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid.\n    Total Moles H⁺ Added = Cacid × Vacid = 0.1 M × Vacid.\n\nCombining these parts, our governing equation is:\n**0.1 × Vacid = (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (10⁻pH × 0.1)**\n\n**4. Test the Given Options**\n\nSince we have two unknowns (Vacid and pH), we cannot solve the equation directly. However, the problem provides pairs of values in the options. We can test each option to see which one satisfies our equation.\n\n**A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n*   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = 2.040 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   This is less than the 2.807 × 10⁻³ mol required just to consume the Fe(OH)₃. Therefore, this option is impossible.\n\n**B) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   Left side of equation: Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = 3.214 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   Right side of equation: (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (10⁻³.¹⁶ × 0.1) = (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (6.92 × 10⁻⁴ × 0.1) = 2.807 × 10⁻³ + 0.069 × 10⁻³ = 2.876 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   3.214 × 10⁻³ ≠ 2.876 × 10⁻³. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   Left side of equation: Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **3.009 × 10⁻³ mol**.\n*   Right side of equation: (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (10⁻².⁶⁹ × 0.1) = (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (2.042 × 10⁻³ × 0.1) = 2.807 × 10⁻³ + 0.204 × 10⁻³ = **3.011 × 10⁻³ mol**.\n*   The values 3.009 × 10⁻³ and 3.011 × 10⁻³ are extremely close. The small difference is due to rounding of molar masses and constants. This option is self-consistent.\n\n**D) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n*   Left side of equation: Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 2.805 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   Right side of equation: (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (10⁻².⁰⁴ × 0.1) = (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (9.12 × 10⁻³ × 0.1) = 2.807 × 10⁻³ + 0.912 × 10⁻³ = 3.719 × 10⁻³ mol.\n*   2.805 × 10⁻³ ≠ 3.719 × 10⁻³. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly option C provides a pair of values for volume and pH that are consistent with the chemical principles and stoichiometry of the dissolution process.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles\n\n### Step 2: Determine the volume of strong acid needed\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid is a neutralization reaction. The net ionic equation is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of this reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol\n\nThe problem states we are using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, which provides 0.1 moles of H⁺ per liter (1000 cm³). We can now calculate the minimum volume of this acid needed.\n*   Volume (L) = Moles of H⁺ / Molarity = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L ≈ 0.02807 L\n*   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 28.07 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume matches the value given in option D (28.05 cm³), with the minor difference likely due to rounding of molar masses.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n\nWhen the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved by the stoichiometric amount of acid, the resulting solution contains Fe³⁺ ions in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The Fe³⁺ ion, more accurately the hexaaquairon(III) ion, [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺, acts as a weak acid by hydrolyzing water.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n\nFirst, calculate the concentration of the Fe³⁺ ion in the final solution:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ / Total Volume = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009357 M\n\nTo find the pH, we need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ ion. According to multiple sources, the Ka for this ion is approximately 6.0 x 10⁻³.\n\nNow, we set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺:\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ | 0.009357 | -x | 0.009357 - x |\n| [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺| 0 | +x | x |\n| H₃O⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nThe Ka expression is:\nKa = [H₃O⁺] * [[Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺] / [[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺]\n6.0 x 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.009357 - x)\n\nThis gives the quadratic equation:\nx² + (6.0 x 10⁻³)x - (5.614 x 10⁻⁵) = 0\n\nSolving for x using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\n*   x = [-(6.0 x 10⁻³) ± √((6.0 x 10⁻³)² - 4(1)(-5.614 x 10⁻⁵))] / 2\n*   x = [-0.006 ± √(3.6 x 10⁻⁵ + 2.2456 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\n*   x = [-0.006 ± √(2.6056 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\n*   x = [-0.006 ± 0.01614] / 2\n\nSince concentration (x) must be positive, we take the positive root:\n*   x = (0.01014) / 2 ≈ 0.00507 M\n\nThe concentration of H₃O⁺ is x, so [H₃O⁺] ≈ 0.00507 M.\n\nFinally, we calculate the pH:\n*   pH = -log[H₃O⁺] = -log(0.00507) ≈ 2.29\n\nThis calculated pH (2.29) is closest to the pH value in option D (2.04). The discrepancy can arise from using slightly different values for molar masses, the Ka of Fe³⁺, or the Ksp of Fe(OH)₃, which can vary between sources. However, the calculated acid volume is a very strong match for option D, and the pH is in the correct acidic range, making D the most plausible answer.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Volume of acid: 28.05 cm³ (matches calculation)\n*   pH: 2.04 (reasonably close to the calculated value of 2.29, and much closer than other options)\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve this chemistry problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculations and identify the correct answer.\n\n### Plan and Explanation\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry:** To dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, we need to add an acid. The acid (H⁺) reacts with the hydroxide part of the solid in a neutralization reaction:\n    `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n    This equation tells us that 3 moles of H⁺ are consumed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ dissolved.\n\n2.  **Account for Equilibrium:** Simply adding the exact amount of acid from the stoichiometry above is not enough. The dissolution is an equilibrium process governed by the solubility product, Ksp:\n    `Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)`\n    `Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³`\n    To keep all the Fe³⁺ ions in solution, the concentration of hydroxide ions, [OH⁻], must be kept very low. This requires an excess of H⁺ ions to remain in the solution, making the final solution acidic. The pH of the final solution is determined by this excess H⁺.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:** The total amount of acid we need to add must do two things:\n    a.  Provide the H⁺ ions that are consumed in the reaction (the stoichiometric amount).\n    b.  Provide the excess H⁺ ions that remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to maintain a sufficiently low pH to prevent re-precipitation.\n\n4.  **Strategy:** The problem provides four possible answers, each with a pH and a volume. The correct answer must be self-consistent. We can write a program to check each option. For each pair of (pH, Volume):\n    a.  Calculate the total moles of H⁺ added using the given volume and acid concentration.\n    b.  Calculate the moles of excess H⁺ remaining in the solution using the given pH and total volume.\n    c.  Subtract the remaining moles from the total moles to find out how many moles of H⁺ must have reacted with the Fe(OH)₃.\n    d.

The final volume of the solution will be 100 cm³. We need to find the minimum volume of acid required and the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n        *   Atomic mass of Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n        *   Atomic mass of O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n        *   Atomic mass of H ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n        *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 55.85 + 3 * (17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol.\n    *   Now, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ from the given mass.\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n3.  **Write the Chemical Reaction:**\n    *   The strong acid provides H⁺ ions, which react with the hydroxide (OH⁻) from Fe(OH)₃ in a neutralization reaction.\n    *   The balanced chemical equation for the dissolution is:\n        Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Needed for the Reaction:**\n    *   From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n    *   This is the amount of H⁺ needed just to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃.\n\n5.  **Consider the Final Solution:**\n    *   After the reaction, the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution contains the dissolved Fe³⁺ ions.\n    *   To keep the Fe³⁺ ions in solution and prevent Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating, the solution must be acidic. This means there must be some excess H⁺ ions remaining after the neutralization reaction.\n    *   The total moles of H⁺ added from the acid must be equal to the moles that reacted plus the moles that remain in excess.\n        *   Total H⁺ added = H⁺ (reacted) + H⁺ (excess)\n\n6.  **Test the Options for Internal Consistency:**\n    *   The problem is a multiple-choice question, and the correct option must be self-consistent. We can test each option to see if the given volume of acid results in the given pH.\n    *   Let V_acid be the volume of acid in cm³.\n    *   Total moles H⁺ added = Concentration * Volume = 0.1 mol/L * (V_acid / 1000) L\n    *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = (Total H⁺ added) - (H⁺ reacted)\n    *   Final [H⁺] = Moles H⁺ (excess) / Final Volume = Moles H⁺ (excess) / 0.1 L\n    *   Final pH = -log([H⁺])\n\n    Let's check **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n    *   **Volume of acid (V_acid):** 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    *   **Total moles H⁺ added:** 0.1 mol/L * 0.03009 L = 0.003009 mol.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ (reacted):** We calculated this in Step 4 as 0.002807 mol.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ (excess):** 0.003009 mol - 0.002807 mol = 0.000202 mol.\n    *   **Final [H⁺]:** 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n    *   **Calculate the resulting pH:** pH = -log(0.00202) ≈ 2.6947.\n\n    This calculated pH of ~2.69 matches the pH given in Option B. Let's quickly check another option to be sure.\n\n    Let's check **Option C: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n\n    *   **Volume of acid (V_acid):** 32.14 cm³ = 0.03214 L\n    *   **Total moles H⁺ added:** 0.1 mol/L * 0.03214 L = 0.003214 mol.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ (excess):** 0.003214 mol - 0.002807 mol = 0.000407 mol.\n    *   **Final [H⁺]:** 0.000407 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00407 M.\n    *   **Calculate the resulting pH:** pH = -log(0.00407) ≈ 2.39.\n    *   This calculated pH (2.39) does not match the given pH (3.16). Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\n    Options A and D provide insufficient acid to even dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ completely, as the moles of H⁺ added would be less than the 0.002807 moles required for the reaction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only option where the volume of acid and the final pH are consistent with the stoichiometry of the reaction is Option B. The \"minimum volume\" condition is met because this is the point where the solution is just saturated, which corresponds to the calculated pH.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation Check:\n*   Acid added: 30.09 cm³ of 0.1 M H⁺.\n*   Moles H⁺ added: 0.003009 mol.\n*   Moles H⁺ to dissolve Fe(OH)₃: 0.002807 mol.\n*   Excess H⁺: 0.003009 - 0.002807 = 0.000202 mol.\n*   Final [H⁺] in 100 cm³: 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n*   Final pH: -log(0.00202) = 2.69.\nThe values are consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Reaction:** The dissolution of solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a strong acid (like HCl or HNO₃, represented by H⁺) is an acid-base neutralization reaction. The balanced chemical equation is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Stoichiometry:** From the balanced equation, we see that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n3.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Given mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g.\n    *   Calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃:\n        *   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n        *   O: 15.999 g/mol\n        *   H: 1.008 g/mol\n        *   Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n4.  **Calculate Moles of H⁺ Needed for Reaction:**\n    *   Using the 1:3 stoichiometric ratio from the balanced equation:\n        *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n        *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n5.  **Account for Final pH (Excess Acid):** To ensure all the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves and remains in solution (i.e., to prevent it from precipitating back out), there must be some excess H⁺ ions remaining in the final solution. The concentration of these excess ions determines the final pH.\n    *   The total moles of H⁺ added from the acid must equal the moles that reacted plus the moles that remain in excess in the final solution.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (final/excess).\n    *   The moles of excess H⁺ are calculated from the final pH and the total volume:\n        *   [H⁺]final = 10⁻ᵖᴴ\n        *   Moles H⁺ (final/excess) = [H⁺]final × Total Volume (in L)\n        *   Total Volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n\n6.  **Calculate Required Acid Volume:** The total moles of H⁺ are supplied by the 0.1 M monobasic strong acid.\n    *   Volume of Acid (L) = Total Moles H⁺ / Concentration of Acid\n    *   Volume of Acid (cm³) = (Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M) × 1000\n\n7.  **Systematic Check of Options:** Since we have two unknowns (final pH and acid volume), we can't solve directly. However, we can use the provided options to see which pair of (pH, Volume) is self-consistent. We will use the pH from each option to calculate the required volume and see if it matches the volume given in that same option.\n\n    *   **Let's test Option B (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³):**\n        *   **Step 1: Find moles of excess H⁺.**\n            *   [H⁺]final = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n            *   Moles H⁺ (final/excess) = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.0002042 mol.\n        *   **Step 2: Find total moles of H⁺ needed.**\n            *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (final/excess)\n            *   Total Moles H⁺ ≈ 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol ≈ 0.0030112 mol.\n        *   **Step 3: Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid required.**\n            *   Volume (cm³) = (0.0030112 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 ≈ 30.11 cm³.\n\n8.  **Compare and Conclude:** The calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ is extremely close to the volume given in Option B (30.09 cm³). The small difference is negligible and likely due to rounding of constants or the values in the question itself. The Python code execution confirms this match precisely and shows that the other options are inconsistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the moles of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we calculate the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Atomic mass of Iron (Fe) ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 moles.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the required volume of strong acid\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) follows this neutralization reaction:\n\n**Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions for complete dissolution.\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 moles.\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed to provide this amount of H⁺.\n*   Volume (L) = Moles / Molarity\n*   Volume (L) = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L.\n\nTo convert this volume to cubic centimeters (cm³), we multiply by 1000.\n*   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume is very close to the value of 28.05 cm³ provided in option D.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n\nAfter the reaction, the 0.0009356 moles of Fe(OH)₃ are converted into 0.0009356 moles of Fe³⁺ ions. The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L.\n\nFirst, calculate the concentration of the Fe³⁺ ions.\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume (L)\n*   [Fe³⁺] = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M.\n\nThe iron(III) ion (Fe³⁺) is a weak acid that hydrolyzes in water, producing H⁺ ions and thus lowering the pH. The hydrolysis reaction is:\n\n**Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)**\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction (Ka) for the hydrated iron(III) ion is approximately 6.5 x 10⁻³.\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the H⁺ concentration at equilibrium.\n*   Initial: [Fe³⁺] = 0.009356 M, [H⁺] ≈ 0\n*   Change: [Fe³⁺] = -x, [H⁺] = +x\n*   Equilibrium: [Fe³⁺] = 0.009356 - x, [H⁺] = x\n\nThe Ka expression is:\nKa = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = (x)(x) / (0.009356 - x)\n6.5 x 10⁻³ = x² / (0.009356 - x)\n\nThis can be rearranged into a quadratic equation:\nx² + (6.5 x 10⁻³)x - (6.08 x 10⁻⁵) = 0\n\nSolving for x (which represents [H⁺]) using the quadratic formula:\nx = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a\nx = [-0.0065 + √((0.0065)² - 4(1)(-6.08 x 10⁻⁵))] / 2\nx = [-0.0065 + √(4.225 x 10⁻⁵ + 2.432 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.0065 + √(2.8545 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.0065 + 0.01689] / 2\nx = 0.01039 / 2 = 0.005195 M\n\nSo, the concentration of H⁺ is 0.005195 M. Now, we can calculate the pH.\n*   pH = -log₁₀[H⁺]\n*   pH = -log₁₀(0.005195) ≈ 2.28\n\nThis pH value (2.28) is closest to the pH of 2.04 in option D. The minor difference can be attributed to variations in the published Ka value for the Fe³⁺ ion or slight rounding during intermediate steps. Based on both the calculated volume and the pH, option D is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the minimum volume of strong acid needed**\n\n1.  **Write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution.**\n    Iron(III) hydroxide, a base, reacts with a strong acid (providing H⁺ ions) in a neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃.**\n    First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Molar mass of Fe ≈ 55.845 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 15.999 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of H ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n\n    Now, calculate the moles from the given mass:\n    Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n3.  **Determine the moles of H⁺ required.**\n    From the stoichiometry of the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n    Moles of H⁺ = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.00280725 mol.\n\n4.  **Calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid.**\n    The \"minimum volume\" required is the stoichiometric amount needed to completely react with all the Fe(OH)₃.\n    Volume = Moles / Concentration\n    Volume of acid = 0.00280725 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280725 L.\n\n5.  **Convert the volume to cm³.**\n    Volume in cm³ = 0.0280725 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 28.07 cm³.\n\n    This calculated volume is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option B. The minor difference is likely due to rounding of atomic masses used in the original problem.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution**\n\n1.  **Determine the composition of the final solution.**\n    After reacting 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ with 28.05 cm³ of 0.1 M acid, the strong acid is completely consumed. The resulting 100 cm³ solution contains the product, Fe³⁺ ions.\n    Moles of Fe³⁺ formed = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ dissolved ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n    Concentration of Fe³⁺ = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.00936 M.\n\n2.  **Consider the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ ion.**\n    The iron(III) ion is a small, highly charged metal ion that acts as a weak acid in water by hydrolyzing it:\n    [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n    For simplicity, this is often written as:\n    Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH from hydrolysis.**\n    The pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of H⁺ (or H₃O⁺) produced in this equilibrium. This requires the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the hydrated Fe³⁺ ion. Literature values for Ka at 25°C are typically in the range of 6 x 10⁻³ to 8 x 10⁻³.\n    Let's set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n    *   Initial [Fe³⁺] = 0.00936 M\n    *   Initial [H⁺] ≈ 0\n    *   At equilibrium, [H⁺] = x\n\n    The Ka expression is: Ka = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = x² / (0.00936 - x)\n    Using a representative Ka value of 6.3 x 10⁻³, we can solve for x:\n    6.3 x 10⁻³ = x² / (0.00936 - x)\n    Solving the quadratic equation gives x = [H⁺] ≈ 0.00515 M.\n    pH = -log(0.00515) ≈ 2.29.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    Our calculated volume (28.07 cm³) matches option B (28.05 cm³).\n    Our calculated pH (~2.3) is reasonably close to the pH in option B (2.04). The discrepancy is likely due to the specific Ka value(s) assumed by the problem, which might also account for the second hydrolysis step, making the solution more acidic (lower pH). The pH values in the other options are not consistent with the chemical principles. For instance, the pH in option A (2.69) is too high to allow for the complete dissolution of 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n\nTherefore, the pair of values in option B is the most chemically consistent answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum amount of strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, and the pH of the resulting 100 cm³ solution. This involves stoichiometry and equilibrium calculations.\n\n**1. Gather Necessary Constants:**\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** The sum of the atomic masses of its elements (Fe, O, H) is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n*   **Solubility Product Constant (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃:** This value indicates the equilibrium of a solid dissolving in water. There is a range of reported values; a common one is 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹, while others are around 1.6 x 10⁻³⁹ or 10⁻³⁶.⁴. For this calculation, we will use the principle that dissolution requires a specific final pH, which depends on the Ksp.\n*   **Acid Dissociation Constant (Ka) for Fe³⁺(aq):** The hydrated iron(III) ion, [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺, acts as an acid. Its pKa is reported to be around 2.2 to 2.46, which means it is a relatively strong acid among metal aqua ions. A pKa of 2.2 corresponds to a Ka of 10⁻²·² ≈ 6.31 x 10⁻³.\n\n**2. Stoichiometric Calculation of Acid Volume:**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved:\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\nThe dissolution reaction with a strong monobasic acid (providing H⁺ ions) is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFrom the stoichiometry, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺.\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\nNow, calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed to provide these moles of H⁺:\n*   Volume of acid = Moles of H⁺ / Concentration = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L ≈ 0.02807 L\n*   Converting to cm³: 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = **28.07 cm³**\n\nThis calculation gives the volume of acid needed just to neutralize the hydroxide from Fe(OH)₃.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Final pH:**\n\nAfter dissolution, the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution contains the Fe³⁺ ions produced.\n*   Concentration of Fe³⁺ = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ / Total Volume = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\nThe Fe³⁺ ion hydrolyzes in water, acting as an acid and establishing an equilibrium:\n[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\nWe can use the Ka for this reaction (Ka ≈ 6.31 x 10⁻³) to find the resulting H⁺ concentration. Let 'x' be the concentration of H⁺ at equilibrium.\nKa = [H⁺][Fe(OH)²⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = (x)(x) / (9.357 x 10⁻³ - x)\n\nSince Ka is relatively large, we solve the quadratic equation:\nx² + (6.31 x 10⁻³)x - (6.31 x 10⁻³)(9.357 x 10⁻³) = 0\nx² + 0.00631x - 5.904 x 10⁻⁵ = 0\n\nSolving this gives x ≈ 5.19 x 10⁻³ M.\n*   x = [H⁺]\n\nNow, calculate the pH:\n*   pH = -log₁₀[H⁺] = -log₁₀(5.19 x 10⁻³) ≈ **2.28**\n\n**4. Re-evaluation and Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated values are approximately 28.07 cm³ for the acid volume and a pH of 2.28. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\nB) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nC) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\nD) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n\nOur calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the volume in option A (28.05 cm³). The calculated pH (2.28) is also closest to the pH in option A (2.04). The minor difference in pH can be attributed to variations in the published Ka value for the Fe³⁺ aqua ion and the fact that the final solution contains a small amount of unreacted H⁺ from the acid addition, which would lower the pH slightly from our hydrolysis-only calculation. If we consider the H⁺ from hydrolysis (5.19 x 10⁻³ M) and add it to any potential excess H⁺, the pH would indeed be lower than 2.28.\n\nThe problem asks for the *minimum* volume of acid. The stoichiometric amount is the absolute minimum required for the neutralization reaction. The resulting acidic solution from the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ ensures that the equilibrium is shifted far towards the dissolved state, satisfying the condition. Therefore, the stoichiometric approach is the most direct interpretation.\n\nBased on the calculations, the volume of acid required is approximately 28.05 cm³, and the resulting solution will have a pH of around 2.04.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nTo dissolve iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, which is a sparingly soluble base, we need to add a strong acid. The acid provides H+ ions that react with the hydroxide ions (OH-) from the Fe(OH)3, shifting the equilibrium towards dissolution.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)3**\n\nFirst, we determine how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we are trying to dissolve.\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 * (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of Acid (H+) Required**\n\nThe added acid serves two purposes:\n*   **Reaction:** To react with and neutralize the Fe(OH)3. According to the stoichiometry (1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+), the moles of H+ needed for the reaction are:\n    Moles H+ (reaction) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 0.0009357 mol = 0.002807 moles\n*   **Maintaining Acidity:** To keep the final solution acidic enough to prevent the Fe(OH)3 from precipitating back out. The amount of H+ remaining in the solution determines the final pH.\n    Moles H+ (remaining) = [H+]_final * Total Volume = 10^(-pH) * 0.1 L\n\nTherefore, the total moles of H+ that must be added from the 0.1 M acid is:\nTotal Moles H+ = Moles H+ (reaction) + Moles H+ (remaining)\n\n**4. Test the Given Options**\n\nWe can now check which of the multiple-choice options is consistent. For each option, we calculate the moles of H+ supplied by the given volume of acid and compare it to the total moles of H+ required for that pH.\n\n*   **Moles of H+ supplied** = Volume of acid (in L) * 0.1 M\n\nLet's test **Option B (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3)**:\n\n*   **Volume of acid:** 30.09 cm3 = 0.03009 L\n*   **Moles of H+ supplied:** 0.03009 L * 0.1 M = **0.003009 moles**\n\nNow, let's calculate the total moles of H+ required to achieve a pH of 2.69:\n\n*   **Moles H+ (reaction):** 0.002807 moles (calculated above)\n*   **Moles H+ (remaining):** 10^(-2.69) * 0.1 L = 0.002042 * 0.1 = 0.0002042 moles\n*   **Total Moles H+ required:** 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = **0.003011 moles**\n\nThe moles of H+ supplied (0.003009) are almost identical to the total moles of H+ required (0.003011). This small difference is due to rounding in the problem's options. This shows that Option B is chemically and mathematically consistent. Testing the other options reveals significant inconsistencies.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a two-part calculation: first, determining the volume of acid needed, and second, finding the pH of the final solution.\n\n### **Part 1: Calculating the Minimum Volume of Acid**\n\n1.  **Reaction Stoichiometry:** The dissolution of solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) is a neutralization reaction. The balanced chemical equation is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n    This equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n2.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** To find the moles of Fe(OH)₃, we first need its molar mass.\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\n    Now, we can calculate the moles from the given mass (0.1 g):\n    Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol\n\n3.  **Moles of Acid (H⁺):** Based on the stoichiometry (1:3 ratio), we can find the moles of H⁺ required to react completely with the Fe(OH)₃. The \"minimum volume\" is interpreted as the stoichiometric amount needed for this reaction.\n    Moles of H⁺ = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.00280725 mol\n\n4.  **Volume of Acid:** The acid is a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid. We can find the required volume using the concentration formula (Volume = Moles / Concentration).\n    Volume of acid (L) = 0.00280725 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280725 L\n    Converting liters to cubic centimeters (1 L = 1000 cm³):\n    Volume of acid (cm³) = 0.0280725 L × 1000 cm³/L ≈ **28.07 cm³**\n\nThis calculated volume is extremely close to the value of 28.05 cm³ given in option B.\n\n### **Part 2: Calculating the pH of the Resulting Solution**\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Condition:** For the Fe(OH)₃ to be completely dissolved, the ion concentrations in the solution must satisfy the solubility product (Ksp) equilibrium:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\n2.  **Concentration of Fe³⁺:** When 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ dissolves in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L), the concentration of Fe³⁺ is:\n    [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ / Total Volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.00936 M\n\n3.  **Finding the pH:** The pH of the solution determines the hydroxide concentration ([OH⁻]) through the autoionization of water (Kw = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C). We need to find the pH at which the Ksp expression is satisfied for the calculated [Fe³⁺]. Instead of assuming a Ksp value, we can test the pH from option B.\n    *   If pH = 2.04, then [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M.\n    *   pOH = 14.00 - pH = 14.00 - 2.04 = 11.96\n    *   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.⁹⁶ M\n\n4.  **Verification:** Let's check if these concentrations are consistent with a known Ksp value for Fe(OH)₃.\n    Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (0.00936) × (10⁻¹¹.⁹⁶)³ ≈ 1.23 × 10⁻³⁸\n    This calculated Ksp value of 1.23 × 10⁻³⁸ is well within the accepted range of literature values for Fe(OH)₃ (typically 10⁻³⁸ to 10⁻³⁹). This confirms that a pH of 2.04 is the correct equilibrium pH required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in the given volume.\n\nThe calculated volume (28.07 cm³) and the verification of the pH (2.04) both strongly support option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to find a self-consistent pair of values: the volume of strong acid needed and the final pH of the solution after dissolving 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃. The most direct way to solve this is to use the principle of mass balance for the hydrogen ions (H⁺) provided by the acid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Chemical Reaction Stoichiometry:**\n    First, we write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, a base, in a strong acid (represented by H⁺):\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This equation shows that **3 moles of H⁺** are consumed for every **1 mole of Fe(OH)₃** that dissolves.\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    Next, we determine the number of moles in the 0.1 g sample of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated from the atomic masses of its elements (Fe ≈ 55.845 g/mol, O ≈ 15.999 g/mol, H ≈ 1.008 g/mol).\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n3.  **Hydrogen Ion (H⁺) Mass Balance:**\n    The total amount of H⁺ added from the 0.1 M acid is partitioned into two parts:\n    a.  **H⁺ that reacts with Fe(OH)₃:** Based on the stoichiometry from Step 1.\n        *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.00280725 mol.\n    b.  **H⁺ that remains in the solution:** This excess H⁺ determines the final pH of the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution.\n        *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = Final [H⁺] × Total Volume = 10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L.\n\n4.  **Relating Acid Volume to pH:**\n    The total moles of H⁺ added is the sum of the reacted and remaining parts.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    The volume of the 0.1 M acid required to deliver this total amount of H⁺ is given by:\n    *   Volume of Acid (L) = Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M\n    *   Volume of Acid (cm³) = 1000 × (Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M)\n\n5.  **Testing the Options for Self-Consistency:**\n    The correct answer must be the (pH, Volume) pair that satisfies the mass balance equation derived above. We can test each option by plugging in the given pH, calculating the required acid volume, and checking if it matches the volume given in that option. A Python script is used for precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants and Initial Calculations ---\n# Molar Mass of Fe(OH)3 (g/mol)\nMM_FeOH3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008)\n\n# Moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved\nmoles_FeOH3 = 0.1 / MM_FeOH3\n\n# Moles of H+ needed to react with Fe(OH)3 based on stoichiometry\nmoles_H_reacted = 3 * moles_FeOH3\n\n# Total volume of the final solution (L)\nV_total_L = 0.1  # 100 cm3\n\n# Concentration of the strong acid (M)\nC_acid = 0.1\n\n# --- Function to test an option for self-consistency ---\ndef check_option(ph, expected_volume_cm3):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the required acid volume based on the given pH and compares\n    it to the expected volume from the option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate moles of H+ remaining in the solution for the given pH\n    moles_H_remaining = (10**(-ph)) * V_total_L\n    \n    # Calculate the total moles of H+ that must have been added\n    total_moles_H_added = moles_H_reacted + moles_H_remaining\n    \n    # Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed to provide this total amount of H+\n    calculated_volume_L = total_moles_H_added / C_acid\n    calculated_volume_cm3 = calculated_volume_L * 1000\n    \n    print(f\"--- Testing Option (pH={ph}, Volume={expected_volume_cm3} cm3) ---\")\n    print(f\"Calculated acid volume needed: {calculated_volume_cm3:.2f} cm3\")\n    print(f\"Expected acid volume from option: {expected_volume_cm3:.2f} cm3\")\n    \n    # Check if the calculated and expected volumes match\n    if math.isclose(calculated_volume_cm3, expected_volume_cm3, rel_tol=1e-3): # 0.1% tolerance for rounding\n        print(\"Result: This option is self-consistent.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Result: This option is NOT self-consistent.\\n\")\n\n# --- Test all given options ---\ncheck_option(ph=3.16, expected_volume_cm3=32.14) # Option A\ncheck_option(ph=2.04, expected_volume_cm3=28.05) # Option B\ncheck_option(ph=2.69, expected_volume_cm3=30.09) # Option C\ncheck_option(ph=4.94, expected_volume_cm3=20.40) # Option D\n```\n```output\n--- Testing Option (pH=3.16, Volume=32.14 cm3) ---\nCalculated acid volume needed: 28.76 cm3\nExpected acid volume from option: 32.14 cm3\nResult: This option is NOT self-consistent.\n\n--- Testing Option (pH=2.04, Volume=28.05 cm3) ---\nCalculated acid volume needed: 37.19 cm3\nExpected acid volume from option: 28.05 cm3\nResult: This option is NOT self-consistent.\n\n--- Testing Option (pH=2.69, Volume=30.09 cm3) ---\nCalculated acid volume needed: 30.11 cm3\nExpected acid volume from option: 30.09 cm3\nResult: This option is self-consistent.\n\n--- Testing Option (pH=4.94, Volume=20.40 cm3) ---\nCalculated acid volume needed: 28.08 cm3\nExpected acid volume from option: 20.40 cm3\nResult: This option is NOT self-consistent.\n\n```\n### Conclusion\nThe calculation shows that only for Option C does the given pH (2.69) lead to a calculated acid volume (30.11 cm³) that closely matches the volume provided in the option (30.09 cm³).

This is a two-part problem.\n\n### Part 1: Calculating the Minimum Volume of Acid\n\nThe dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide in a strong acid is represented by the following chemical equation:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe \"minimum volume\" is generally interpreted as the stoichiometric amount of acid required for the reaction to go to completion.\n\n1.  **Calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   M(Fe) = 55.845 g/mol\n    *   M(O) = 15.999 g/mol\n    *   M(H) = 1.008 g/mol\n    *   M(Fe(OH)₃) = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved:**\n    *   Mass = 0.1 g\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol\n\n3.  **Determine the moles of H⁺ required:**\n    *   From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.00280725 mol\n\n4.  **Calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid:**\n    *   Concentration of acid = 0.1 mol/L\n    *   Volume (L) = Moles / Concentration = 0.00280725 mol / 0.1 mol/L ≈ 0.02807 L\n    *   Convert volume to cm³: Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L × 1000 cm³/L ≈ 28.07 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the value of 28.05 cm³ provided in option D. The other options are not close. This strongly suggests that this stoichiometric calculation is the intended method for finding the volume.\n\n### Part 2: Calculating the pH of the Resulting Solution\n\nAfter the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The Fe³⁺ ion is acidic and hydrolyzes in water, which lowers the pH.\n\n1.  **Calculate the concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.00936 M\n\n2.  **Consider the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺:**\n    *   The primary hydrolysis reaction is: Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n    *   The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction is approximately 6.3 × 10⁻³.\n\n3.  **Calculate the equilibrium [H⁺] and pH:**\n    *   Using an ICE table, we get the expression: Ka = [H⁺]² / ([Fe³⁺] - [H⁺])\n    *   6.3 × 10⁻³ = x² / (0.00936 - x), where x = [H⁺]\n    *   Solving the resulting quadratic equation (x² + 6.3×10⁻³x - 5.9×10⁻⁵ = 0) gives x ≈ 0.00515 M.\n    *   pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.00515) ≈ 2.29\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOur calculations give:\n*   **Volume ≈ 28.07 cm³**\n*   **pH ≈ 2.29**\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\nA) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nB) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\nC) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nD) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n\nThe calculated volume (28.07 cm³) matches option D (28.05 cm³) almost perfectly. However, our calculated pH (2.29) does not match the pH in option D (2.04).\n\nThis discrepancy is common in complex chemistry problems presented in a multiple-choice format. The calculation for the volume is based on a simple, robust stoichiometric principle. The calculation for pH is more sensitive and depends on the specific equilibrium constants (Ksp, Ka) used and the complexity of the model (e.g., including multiple hydrolysis steps).\n\nGiven the excellent agreement for the volume, it is most likely that the question intends for the student to identify the correct option based on the straightforward stoichiometric calculation. The pH value of 2.04 is the other part of the correct answer pair, even though it doesn't align with a simple hydrolysis calculation.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is the one that matches our reliable volume calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the chemical problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\nTo dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, we must add an acid. The strong acid provides H+ ions that react with the hydroxide ions (OH-) from the Fe(OH)3, shifting the solubility equilibrium to the right.\n\nThe primary reaction is:\nFe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n\nHowever, once the iron is in solution as the hydrated ion [Fe(H2O)6]3+ (abbreviated as Fe3+), it acts as a weak acid itself, hydrolyzing water and establishing another equilibrium:\nFe3+(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ [Fe(OH)(H2O)5]2+(aq) + H+(aq) (simplified as Fe(OH)2+)\n\nThe \"minimum volume\" of acid corresponds to creating a solution with the highest possible pH (least amount of excess acid) at which all the Fe(OH)3 has just dissolved. This final pH is determined by a balance between the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3 and the acid dissociation constant (Ka) of the aqueous Fe3+ ion.\n\n**2. List Knowns and Constants**\n\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g\n*   Total solution volume (V_total) = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n*   Acid concentration (C_acid) = 0.1 M\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol\n*   Solubility Product of Fe(OH)3 (Ksp) at 25°C ≈ 2.7 x 10⁻³⁹ (a common literature value)\n*   Acid Dissociation Constant for [Fe(H2O)6]3+ (Ka) ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻³ (pKa ≈ 2.2)\n*   Ion Product for Water (Kw) = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Concentration of Iron**\n\nFirst, we find the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 and its total concentration if it all dissolves.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol = 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n*   Total Iron Concentration [Fe_total] = Moles / V_total = 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L = 9.356 x 10⁻³ M\n\n**4. Determine the pH of the Resulting Solution**\n\nAt the point of minimum dissolution, the solution is saturated. The final pH ([H+]) is dictated by the interplay of Ksp and Ka. The relationship can be derived as follows:\n\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n[Fe_total] = [Fe³⁺] + [Fe(OH)²⁺]\nKa = ([Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺]) / [Fe³⁺]\nKw = [H⁺][OH⁻]\n\nBy combining these four equations, we can derive a single equation to solve for the final [H⁺]:\nKsp = ( [Fe_total] × Kw³ ) / ( [H⁺]³ + Ka × [H⁺]² )\n\nPlugging in the values:\n2.7 x 10⁻³⁹ = ( (9.356 x 10⁻³) × (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)³ ) / ( [H⁺]³ + (6.3 x 10⁻³) × [H⁺]² )\n2.7 x 10⁻³⁹ = ( 9.356 x 10⁻⁴⁵ ) / ( [H⁺]³ + 0.0063 × [H⁺]² )\n[H⁺]³ + 0.0063 × [H⁺]² = 9.356 x 10⁻⁴⁵ / 2.7 x 10⁻³⁹\n[H⁺]³ + 0.0063 × [H⁺]² = 3.465 x 10⁻⁶\n\nWe can solve this cubic equation for [H⁺]. A good approach is to test the pH values given in the options.\nLet's test the pH from option D: pH = 3.16\n[H⁺] = 10⁻³.¹⁶ ≈ 6.92 x 10⁻⁴ M\n\nSubstitute this into the left side of the equation:\n(6.92 x 10⁻⁴)³ + 0.0063 × (6.92 x 10⁻⁴)² ≈ (3.3 x 10⁻¹⁰) + (3.0 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 3.3 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThis value (3.3 x 10⁻⁶) is very close to the required value of 3.465 x 10⁻⁶. This confirms that the pH of the resulting solution is indeed **3.16**.\n\n**5. Determine the Minimum Volume of Acid**\n\nThe most accurate way to determine the volume of acid added is to use the principle of charge neutrality for the final solution. The sum of all positive charges must equal the sum of all negative charges. Let A⁻ be the anion from the strong acid (e.g., Cl⁻).\n\nCharge Balance: 3[Fe³⁺] + 2[Fe(OH)²⁺] + [H⁺] = [A⁻] + [OH⁻]\n\nWe need to find the concentrations of the iron species at pH 3.16.\n*   [H⁺] = 6.92 x 10⁻⁴ M\n*   [Fe³⁺] = [Fe_total] / (1 + Ka/[H⁺]) = (9.356 x 10⁻³) / (1 + (6.3 x 10⁻³)/(6.92 x 10⁻⁴)) ≈ 9.26 x 10⁻⁴ M\n*   [Fe(OH)²⁺] = [Fe_total] - [Fe³⁺] = (9.356 x 10⁻³) - (9.26 x 10⁻⁴) ≈ 8.43 x 10⁻³ M\n*   [OH⁻] is negligible at this pH.\n\nNow, we solve for [A⁻], which is the final concentration of the acid's anion:\n[A⁻] ≈ 3(9.26 x 10⁻⁴) + 2(8.43 x 10⁻³) + (6.92 x 10⁻⁴)\n[A⁻] ≈ 0.00278 + 0.01686 + 0.000692 ≈ 0.02033 M\n\nThe moles of acid added are equal to the moles of A⁻ in the solution:\nMoles of Acid = [A⁻] × V_total = 0.02033 M × 0.1 L = 0.002033 mol\n\nFinally, calculate the initial volume of the 0.1 M acid:\nVolume of Acid = Moles / Concentration = 0.002033 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02033 L = **20.33 cm³**\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe detailed calculation yields:\n*   pH = 3.16\n*   Volume = 20.33 cm³\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nB) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\nC) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nD) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n\nOur calculated pH of 3.16 perfectly matches option D. Our calculated volume of 20.33 cm³ is very close to the volume in option A (20.40 cm³). This indicates a likely inconsistency in the question's options, where the correct pH is paired with an incorrect volume. However, the pH calculation is complex and specific, making it the most probable intended correct answer. The volume in option D (32.14 cm³) is inconsistent with the principles of charge balance for the given pH. Therefore, selecting the option with the correct pH is the most logical choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user wants me to solve a quantitative chemistry problem. I have laid out the steps and now I need the constants.\n\nFrom the search results:\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)3**: The results consistently give a value around 106.87 g/mol or 106.88 g/mol. I will use 106.87 g/mol.\n*   **Ksp of Fe(OH)3**: The values for Ksp vary significantly across different sources.\n    *   `10^-36.4` which is `10^0.6 * 10^-37` ≈ `3.98 x 10^-37`\n    *   `1.1 x 10^-36`\n    *   `2.6 x 10^-39`\n    *   `4.0 x 10^-38`\n    *   `6 x 10^-38`\n    *   `2.79 x 10^-39`\n    *   One result gives a wildly different value of `9.83 x 10^20`, which seems incorrect for a sparingly soluble salt. It's likely a calculation for a different reaction.\n\nThe values are clustered in the `10^-36` to `10^-39` range. This is a huge range, and the final pH will be very sensitive to this value. Let's try a few values to see how much the result changes. A common textbook value is around `2.8 x 10^-39`. Another one is `4 x 10^-38`. Let's use a value from the search results, `1.1 x 10^-36`, as it's explicitly stated for 25°C. Let's also try `2.79 x 10^-39` which is also a plausible value.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation using `Ksp = 2.79 x 10^-39` as it is a frequently cited value in literature and textbooks. If the result doesn't match any of the options, I will recalculate with another Ksp value.\n\n**Step-by-step Calculation**\n\n**1. Molar Mass and Moles of Fe(OH)3**\n*   Molar Mass = 106.87 g/mol\n*   Mass = 0.1 g\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol\n\n**2. Concentration of Fe³⁺**\n*   The Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in a total volume of 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n*   [Fe³⁺] = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M\n\n**3. Equilibrium [OH⁻] and pH**\n*   The dissolution equilibrium is: `Fe(OH)3(s) <=> Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)`\n*   The solubility product expression is: `Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³`\n*   We are at the point where all the solid has just dissolved, so we can use the Ksp to find the maximum [OH⁻] allowed in the solution.\n*   Let's use `Ksp = 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹`\n*   `2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ = (0.009357) * [OH⁻]³`\n*   `[OH⁻]³ = (2.79 x 10⁻³⁹) / 0.009357 = 2.982 x 10⁻³⁷`\n*   `[OH⁻] = (2.982 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) = 6.68 x 10⁻¹³ M`\n*   `pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.68 x 10⁻¹³) = 12.18`\n*   `pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.18 = 1.82`\n\nThis pH value (1.82) is quite different from the options. Let's try another Ksp value, for example, `4.0 x 10⁻³⁸`.\n*   `[OH⁻]³ = (4.0 x 10⁻³⁸) / 0.009357 = 4.275 x 10⁻³⁶`\n*   `[OH⁻] = (4.275 x 10⁻³⁶)^(1/3) = 1.623 x 10⁻¹² M`\n*   `pOH = -log₁₀(1.623 x 10⁻¹²) = 11.79`\n*   `pH = 14 - 11.79 = 2.21`\nThis is getting closer to option B (pH 2.04).\n\nLet's try `Ksp = 1.0 x 10⁻³⁸`.\n*   `[OH⁻]³ = (1.0 x 10⁻³⁸) / 0.009357 = 1.069 x 10⁻³⁶`\n*   `[OH⁻] = (1.069 x 10⁻³⁶)^(1/3) = 1.022 x 10⁻¹² M`\n*   `pOH = -log₁₀(1.022 x 10⁻¹²) = 11.99`\n*   `pH = 14 - 11.99 = 2.01`\nThis is very close to pH 2.04. The Ksp value is likely in this range. Let's work backwards from the pH of option B to see what Ksp it implies.\n\n**Let's assume pH = 2.04 (from option B) is correct and calculate the required acid volume.**\n\n**4. Required Volume of Acid (assuming pH = 2.04)**\n*   If the final pH is 2.04, then the final concentration of H⁺ is:\n    *   `[H⁺]_final = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ = 0.00912 M`\n*   The overall reaction is: `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) -> Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n*   The total moles of H⁺ added from the acid must account for two things:\n    1.  The moles of H⁺ that react with the OH⁻ from Fe(OH)₃.\n    2.  The moles of H⁺ that remain in the solution to create the final pH.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.0009357 mol.\n*   Moles of H⁺ reacted = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.002807 mol.\n*   Moles of H⁺ remaining in the 0.1 L solution = `[H⁺]_final * Volume` = 0.00912 M * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\n*   Total moles of H⁺ added = Moles reacted + Moles remaining\n    *   Total moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\n*   This total amount of H⁺ comes from the 0.1 M strong acid.\n    *   Volume of acid = Total moles H⁺ / Concentration of acid\n    *   Volume of acid (L) = 0.003719 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03719 L.\n*   Volume of acid (cm³) = 0.03719 L * 1000 cm³/L = 37.19 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume in option B (28.05 cm³). There must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"Total moles of H+ added\".\n\nThe total moles of H+ added is `C_acid * V_acid = 0.1 * V_acid`.\nThe final concentration of H+ is `[H+]_final`.\nThe final concentration of Fe3+ is `[Fe3+]_final`.\n\nLet `V_a` be the volume of acid in Liters.\nTotal moles of H+ added = `0.1 * V_a`.\nTotal moles of Fe(OH)3 = `n_Fe = 0.0009357` mol.\n\nIn the final solution (volume = 0.1 L):\nMoles of H+ reacted = `3 * n_Fe = 0.002807` mol.\nMoles of H+ unreacted = `[H+]_final * 0.1`.\nTotal moles H+ = `0.1 * V_a`.\n\nThis seems correct. Let's re-check the calculation.\npH = 2.04 -> [H+] = 10^-2.04 = 0.00912 M.\nMoles H+ remaining = 0.00912 M * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\nMoles H+ reacted = 3 * (0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol) = 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.002807 mol.\nTotal moles H+ needed = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\nVolume of 0.1 M acid = 0.003719 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³.\n\nThis still doesn't match. Let's check the other options.\n\nWhat if the question implies that the volume of the acid is NOT part of the final 100 cm³? The wording \"dissolve ... in 100 cm3 total volume\" suggests it is. But let's test the alternative.\nIf the final volume is `100 cm³ + V_acid`, the calculation becomes more complex.\n`V_total = 0.1 + V_a`\n`[H+]_final = (moles_H+_added - moles_H+_reacted) / V_total`\n`0.00912 = (0.1 * V_a - 0.002807) / (0.1 + V_a)`\n`0.000912 + 0.00912 * V_a = 0.1 * V_a - 0.002807`\n`0.003719 = (0.1 - 0.00912) * V_a = 0.09088 * V_a`\n`V_a = 0.003719 / 0.09088 = 0.04092 L = 40.92 cm³`. Still not matching.\n\nLet's go back to the initial assumption: Total Volume = 100 cm³.\nThere must be something I am missing. Let's re-read the question carefully.\n\"dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?\"\n\nLet's re-calculate everything from scratch, being very precise.\n\n**1. Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n*   Molar Mass Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3*(15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**2. Stoichiometric H⁺ required**\n*   Reaction: Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O\n*   Moles H⁺ needed for reaction = 3 * (9.3575 x 10⁻⁴) = 2.80725 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n**3. Final concentrations**\n*   Total Volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n*   [Fe³⁺] = (9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.3575 x 10⁻³ M\n\n**4. Equilibrium pH**\n*   The solution is at equilibrium when all 0.1g is dissolved.\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n*   Let's try to find a Ksp value that leads to one of the pH values in the options.\n    *   Option A: pH = 2.69 -> pOH = 11.31 -> [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹·³¹ = 4.898 x 10⁻¹² M\n    *   Option B: pH = 2.04 -> pOH = 11.96 -> [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹·⁹⁶ = 1.096 x 10⁻¹² M\n    *   Option C: pH = 4.94 -> pOH = 9.06 -> [OH⁻] = 10⁻⁹·⁰⁶ = 8.710 x 10⁻¹⁰ M\n    *   Option D: pH = 3.16 -> pOH = 10.84 -> [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹⁰·⁸⁴ = 1.445 x 10⁻¹¹ M\n\n*   Let's calculate the implied Ksp for each option: Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.3575 x 10⁻³) * [OH⁻]³\n    *   Option A: Ksp = (9.3575 x 10⁻³) * (4.898 x 10⁻¹²)³ = 1.10 x 10⁻³⁶\n    *   Option B: Ksp = (9.3575 x 10⁻³) * (1.096 x 10⁻¹²)³ = 1.23 x 10⁻³⁸\n    *   Option C: Ksp = (9.3575 x 10⁻³) * (8.710 x 10⁻¹⁰)³ = 6.17 x 10⁻³⁰\n    *   Option D: Ksp = (9.3575 x 10⁻³) * (1.445 x 10⁻¹¹)³ = 2.82 x 10⁻³⁵\n\n*   The Ksp values from the literature search were in the range 10⁻³⁶ to 10⁻³⁹.\n    *   The Ksp implied by Option A (`1.10 x 10⁻³⁶`) is very plausible and matches one of the search results exactly.\n    *   The Ksp implied by Option B (`1.23 x 10⁻³⁸`) is also plausible.\n    *   The Ksp for Option D is a bit high but possible.\n    *   The Ksp for Option C is too high to be realistic for Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   Let's assume Option A is the correct one and calculate the required volume of acid.\n    *   pH = 2.69\n    *   [H⁺]_final = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ = 2.042 x 10⁻³ M\n    *   Moles H⁺ remaining = [H⁺]_final * Volume = (2.042 x 10⁻³ M) * 0.1 L = 2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n    *   Moles H⁺ reacted = 2.80725 x 10⁻³ mol (from step 2)\n    *   Total moles H⁺ needed = (2.80725 x 10⁻³) + (2.042 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.01145 x 10⁻³ mol\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M acid = (3.01145 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0301145 L\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 30.11 cm³\n\n*   This calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is extremely close to the volume in Option A (30.09 cm³). The minor difference is likely due to rounding of molar mass or other constants.\n\nLet's re-check the calculation for Option B just to be sure.\n*   pH = 2.04\n*   [H⁺]_final = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ = 9.120 x 10⁻³ M\n*   Moles H⁺ remaining = (9.120 x 10⁻³ M) * 0.1 L = 9.120 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n*   Moles H⁺ reacted = 2.80725 x 10⁻³ mol\n*   Total moles H⁺ needed = (2.80725 x 10⁻³) + (9.120 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.71925 x 10⁻³ mol\n*   Volume of 0.1 M acid = (3.71925 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³\n*   This (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume in Option B (28.05 cm³).\n\nThe calculations strongly support Option A. The logic is sound:\n1.  Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.\n2.  For each potential answer (pH, Volume), calculate the Ksp that the pH implies.\n3.  Check if this Ksp is a reasonable value for Fe(OH)₃.\n4.  For the same potential answer, calculate the total moles of acid required (moles to react + moles to remain to establish the pH).\n5.  From the total moles of acid, calculate the required volume of the 0.1 M acid solution.\n6.  If the calculated volume matches the volume given in the option, that is the correct answer.\n\nThe pair of values in Option A (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³) are consistent with each other based on a Ksp value of ~1.1 x 10⁻³⁶, which is a literature-supported value. The other options are not internally consistent.\n\nFinal check of the calculation for A:\n*   Moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 / 106.87 = 0.0009357 mol\n*   Moles H+ reacted = 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.0028071 mol\n*   Final [H+] from pH 2.69 = 10^-2.69 = 0.0020417 M\n*   Moles H+ remaining in 0.1 L = 0.0020417 * 0.1 = 0.00020417 mol\n*   Total moles H+ = 0.0028071 + 0.00020417 = 0.00301127 mol\n*   Volume of 0.1 M acid = 0.00301127 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0301127 L\n*   Volume in cm3 = 30.11 cm³\nThis matches option A (30.09 cm³) very well. The small discrepancy is due to rounding differences in the molar mass or the given values in the option.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molar Mass and Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we calculate the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe = 55.85 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of O = 16.00 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of H = 1.01 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol = 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**2. Write the Chemical Reaction**\n\nTo dissolve the sparingly soluble Fe(OH)₃, the added strong acid (let's denote it as H⁺) neutralizes the hydroxide ions (OH⁻), shifting the dissolution equilibrium to the right.\n*   Dissolution: Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n*   Neutralization: 3H⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq) → 3H₂O(l)\n*   Overall Reaction: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFrom the overall reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ for the stoichiometric reaction.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final Solution**\n\nThe problem states the total volume of the final solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The acid added serves two purposes:\n*   To react completely with the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   To leave a certain amount of excess H⁺ ions that will determine the final pH of the solution.\n\nWe will test the provided options to see which one is chemically consistent. Let's analyze Option A.\n\n**4. Test Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Step 4a: Calculate the excess H⁺ moles from the pH.**\n    If the final pH is 2.69, the concentration of H⁺ in the solution is:\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.00204 M\n    The number of excess H⁺ moles remaining in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution is:\n    *   Moles of excess H⁺ = [H⁺] * Volume = 0.00204 mol/L * 0.1 L = 2.04 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n*   **Step 4b: Calculate the H⁺ moles needed for the reaction.**\n    From step 1, we have 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol of Fe(OH)₃. Based on the 1:3 stoichiometry:\n    *   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 * (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Step 4c: Calculate the total H⁺ moles and the required acid volume.**\n    The total moles of H⁺ that must be added is the sum of the moles for the reaction and the excess moles.\n    *   Total H⁺ moles = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (2.04 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.011 x 10⁻³ mol\n    The volume of a 0.1 M strong acid needed to provide these moles is:\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = (3.011 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03011 L\n    *   Converting to cm³: Volume = 0.03011 L * 1000 cm³/L = 30.11 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ is in excellent agreement with the volume of 30.09 cm³ given in Option A. The minor difference is due to rounding of constants.\n\n**5. Verify the Equilibrium Condition (Optional)**\n\nWe can also verify that the pH of 2.69 is consistent with the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   At pH 2.69, pOH = 14 - 2.69 = 11.31\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹·³¹ M\n*   [Fe³⁺] = (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.356 x 10⁻³ M\n*   The ion product Qsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.356 x 10⁻³)(10⁻¹¹·³¹)³ ≈ 1.1 x 10⁻³⁶\nThis calculated Qsp value matches known literature values for the Ksp of Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C, confirming that the solution would be at saturation.\n\nThe values in Option A are consistent with the principles of stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium. A similar analysis of the other options shows they are not internally consistent.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Calculating the Minimum Volume of Acid\n\n1.  **Reaction Stoichiometry:**\n    First, we need to write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a strong monobasic acid (represented by H⁺). Fe(OH)₃ is a base and reacts with the acid in a neutralization reaction.\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n\n2.  **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    We calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ using the atomic masses of its constituent elements (Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol, O ≈ 16.00 g/mol, H ≈ 1.01 g/mol).\n    Molar Mass = 55.85 + 3 × (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\n3.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    The problem states we are dissolving 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 moles.\n\n4.  **Moles of H⁺ Required:**\n    Using the stoichiometry from step 1, we find the moles of H⁺ needed.\n    Moles of H⁺ = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 moles.\n\n5.  **Volume of Acid:**\n    The acid is a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. The minimum volume needed is the volume that contains 0.002807 moles of H⁺.\n    Volume (L) = Moles / Concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L.\n    To convert this to cm³, we multiply by 1000.\n    Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L × 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the volume given in option C (28.05 cm³).\n\n### Part 2: Calculating the pH of the Resulting Solution\n\n1.  **Concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    After dissolution, the 0.0009356 moles of Fe³⁺ are in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009356 M.\n\n2.  **Hydrolysis of Fe³⁺:**\n    The iron(III) ion is a Lewis acid and hydrolyzes in water, producing H⁺ ions and making the solution acidic. The hydrated ion [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ acts as a weak acid.\n    [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Calculation:**\n    To find the pH, we need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction. Published pKa values for [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ are typically around 2.1 to 2.5. Let's use a common value, pKa = 2.2, which corresponds to Ka = 10⁻²·² ≈ 6.31 × 10⁻³.\n\n    We set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n| Species | [Fe³⁺] | [Fe(OH)²⁺] | [H₃O⁺] |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Initial | 0.009356 | 0 | 0 |\n| Change | -x | +x | +x |\n| Equilibrium| 0.009356 - x | x | x |\n\n    The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H₃O⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = x² / (0.009356 - x)\n\n    Substituting the values:\n    6.31 × 10⁻³ = x² / (0.009356 - x)\n\n    This requires solving a quadratic equation: x² + (6.31 × 10⁻³)x - 5.90 × 10⁻⁵ = 0.\n    Solving for x (which represents [H₃O⁺]) gives:\n    x ≈ 0.00515 M.\n\n4.  **Final pH:**\n    pH = -log₁₀([H₃O⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.00515) ≈ 2.29.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOur calculated values are:\n*   Volume ≈ 28.07 cm³\n*   pH ≈ 2.29\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n*   B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n*   C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n*   D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n\nThe calculated volume (28.07 cm³) matches option C (28.05 cm³) almost perfectly. The calculated pH (≈2.3) is in the same acidic range as option C's pH (2.04), although not identical. The discrepancy in pH may arise from the specific Ka value used in the problem's design, which is not provided. However, the volume calculation is based on fundamental stoichiometry and is very reliable. Therefore, option C is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
