    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species and reactions.**\n    The solution is created by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate ($KH_2PO_4$) and sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate ($Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$) in water. These salts dissociate completely into their ions:\n    *   $KH_2PO_4(s) \\rightarrow K^+(aq) + H_2PO_4^-(aq)$\n    *   $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O(s) \\rightarrow 2Na^+(aq) + HPO_4^{2-}(aq) + 2H_2O(l)$\n\n    The key species for the acid-base chemistry are the dihydrogen phosphate ion ($H_2PO_4^-$) and the hydrogen phosphate ion ($HPO_4^{2-}$). These constitute a conjugate acid-base pair and form a buffer solution. The relevant equilibria for phosphoric acid ($H_3PO_4$) are:\n    *   (1) $H_3PO_4 \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + H_2PO_4^-$ , $K_{a1} = 7.5 \\times 10^{-3}$\n    *   (2) $H_2PO_4^- \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + HPO_4^{2-}$ , $K_{a2} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-8}$\n    *   (3) $HPO_4^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + PO_4^{3-}$ , $K_{a3} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12}$\n\n    We are looking for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, $[PO_4^{3-}]$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations.**\n    First, we calculate the number of moles of each phosphate species added to the solution. The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L.\n    *   Moles of $H_2PO_4^-$ (from $KH_2PO_4$):\n        $n(H_2PO_4^-) = \\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{Molar Mass}} = \\frac{1.00 \\text{ g}}{136.09 \\text{ g/mol}} = 0.007348 \\text{ mol}$\n    *   Moles of $HPO_4^{2-}$ (from $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$):\n        $n(HPO_4^{2-}) = \\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{Molar Mass}} = \\frac{1.00 \\text{ g}}{177.99 \\text{ g/mol}} = 0.005618 \\text{ mol}$\n\n    Next, we find their initial concentrations in the 0.20000 L solution:\n    *   $[H_2PO_4^-] = \\frac{0.007348 \\text{ mol}}{0.20000 \\text{ L}} = 0.03674 \\text{ M}$\n    *   $[HPO_4^{2-}] = \\frac{0.005618 \\text{ mol}}{0.20000 \\text{ L}} = 0.02809 \\text{ M}$\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration $[H^+]$.**\n    The solution is a buffer dominated by the conjugate pair $H_2PO_4^-$ and $HPO_4^{2-}$. The pH of this buffer is determined by the second dissociation equilibrium (2):\n    $K_{a2} = \\frac{[H^+][HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]}$\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for $[H^+]$. Since this is a buffer, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations of the conjugate pair with their initial concentrations.\n    $[H^+] = K_{a2} \\frac{[H_2PO_4^-]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]} = (6.2 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times \\frac{0.03674 \\text{ M}}{0.02809 \\text{ M}} = 8.109 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ M}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration $[PO_4^{3-}]$.**\n    The orthophosphate ion, $PO_4^{3-}$, is produced in the third dissociation equilibrium (3). The concentration of $[H^+]$ is controlled by the main buffer equilibrium calculated in the previous step.\n    $K_{a3} = \\frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n\n    We can rearrange this equation to solve for $[PO_4^{3-}]$. We use the calculated $[H^+]$ and the initial concentration of $[HPO_4^{2-}]$ (which is negligibly changed by this very weak third dissociation).\n    $[PO_4^{3-}] = K_{a3} \\frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]} = (1.8 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times \\frac{0.02809 \\text{ M}}{8.109 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ M}}$\n    $[PO_4^{3-}] = 6.235 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\nThis value is closest to option C. To get a more precise value, we can use a single script for the entire calculation to avoid rounding errors.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nV = 0.20000  # L\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Calculate initial concentrations\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / V\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / V\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation matching the options\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ($PO_4^{3-}$) in a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and calculate their moles:**\n    The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate ($KH_2PO_4$) and sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate ($Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$). These salts dissociate in water to provide the active buffer components:\n    *   $H_2PO_4^-$ (from $KH_2PO_4$)\n    *   $HPO_4^{2-}$ (from $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$)\n\n    First, we calculate the moles of each substance:\n    *   Moles of $H_2PO_4^-$ = $\\frac{\\text{mass of } KH_2PO_4}{\\text{Molar mass of } KH_2PO_4} = \\frac{1.00 \\text{ g}}{136.09 \\text{ g/mol}}$\n    *   Moles of $HPO_4^{2-}$ = $\\frac{\\text{mass of } Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O}{\\text{Molar mass of } Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O} = \\frac{1.00 \\text{ g}}{177.99 \\text{ g/mol}}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L. We can now calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.\n    *   $[H_2PO_4^-]_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{\\text{moles of } H_2PO_4^-}{\\text{Volume (L)}}$\n    *   $[HPO_4^{2-}]_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{\\text{moles of } HPO_4^{2-}}{\\text{Volume (L)}}$\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration $[H^+]$:**\n    The species $H_2PO_4^-$ and $HPO_4^{2-}$ form a conjugate acid-base pair. The equilibrium that governs the pH of this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    $H_2PO_4^- \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + HPO_4^{2-}$\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is $K_{a2} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n    $K_{a2} = \\frac{[H^+][HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]}$\n    We can rearrange this to solve for $[H^+]$. Since it's a buffer, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations of the acid and base with their initial concentrations.\n    $[H^+] = K_{a2} \\times \\frac{[H_2PO_4^-]_{\\text{initial}}}{[HPO_4^{2-}]_{\\text{initial}}}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration $[PO_4^{3-}]$:**\n    The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    $HPO_4^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + PO_4^{3-}$\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is $K_{a3} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12}$.\n    $K_{a3} = \\frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n    We can rearrange this equation to solve for our target species, $[PO_4^{3-}]$:\n    $[PO_4^{3-}] = K_{a3} \\times \\frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]}$\n    Here, we use the $[H^+]$ calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of $[HPO_4^{2-}]$ (since its dissociation is negligible due to the very small $K_{a3}$).\n\nThe Python code executed these calculations precisely:\n*   It calculated the initial concentrations of $H_2PO_4^-$ and $HPO_4^{2-}$.\n*   It then used the $K_{a2}$ equilibrium to find the concentration of $H^+$.\n*   Finally, it used this $[H^+]$ and the $K_{a3}$ equilibrium to find the concentration of $PO_4^{3-}$.\n\nThe code's output was `6.24e-07`, which means the concentration of the orthophosphate ion is $6.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
