    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Reactants:** Butan-2-one is a ketone. Sodium cyanide (NaCN) provides the nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a classic cyanohydrin formation reaction. It proceeds via the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n        *   Step 1: The cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one, breaking the C=O pi bond and forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   Step 2: This negatively charged alkoxide ion is a base and needs to be protonated to form the final neutral cyanohydrin product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. The options for A are H₃O⁺ and NaHSO₃.\n        *   **H₃O⁺:** This represents a strong acid in aqueous solution (e.g., HCl(aq) or H₂SO₄(aq)). It is an excellent source of protons and is commonly used in the workup step of such reactions or to generate HCN *in situ* from NaCN. This is a suitable choice.\n        *   **NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products (crystalline solids), which is a different reaction. It is not used to facilitate cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be H₃O⁺. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Reactant:** The starting material is an α-hydroxy nitrile (a type of cyanohydrin).\n    *   **Product:** The product is an α-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Transformation:** The nitrile group (-C≡N) is converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This reaction is known as the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Nitrile hydrolysis requires either an acid or a base catalyst and heat, in the presence of water (H₂O is given). Reagent B acts as the catalyst. The options for B (from the remaining choices A and B) are CH₃COOH and HCl.\n        *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong mineral acid. Strong acids are very effective and common catalysts for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate which is then also hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak organic acid. While it could theoretically catalyze the reaction, the process would be extremely slow and inefficient compared to using a strong acid like HCl. For a complete and practical conversion, a strong acid is the standard choice.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B should be a strong acid catalyst. HCl is the much more suitable and conventional reagent for this transformation than CH₃COOH.\n\n3.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis of Reaction 1, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   Based on the analysis of Reaction 2, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these two conclusions, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n    *   This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
