    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data to identify the products and their quantities.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This indicates that no acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase is due to the oxygen that reacted. Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   The mass of oxygen that reacted is 0.80g, so the mass of O₂ gas is also 0.80g. The problem states \"the weights of tubes ... №3 increased by ... 0.80 g (CuO formed...)\", which can be interpreted that the mass increase of the tube *contents* is 0.80g, which is the mass of the bound oxygen. Let's try to be precise, the increase in weight of the *tube* is the mass of the substance it absorbed. For the reaction 2Cu + O₂ -> 2CuO, the tube contains Cu initially, and CuO finally. The mass increase is the mass of oxygen atoms. Thus, mass of O = 0.80g is not correct. The mass of O₂ gas reacted is 0.80 g.\n    *   Let me re-read \"the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g\". The weight of the tube increases by what it takes from the gas stream. So the mass of O₂ is 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The gas that doesn't react with any of the previous reagents.\n    *   Volume = 2.24 L at STP.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the common products of salt decomposition and its inertness in this setup, Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Verify the composition of the initial salts.**\n\nThe decomposition of the salt mixture (A and B) yields:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\nLet's find the total mass of these products to see if it matches the initial mass.\n*   Mass of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 mol H/mol H₂O × 1.0 g/mol H = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of O = (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 mol O/mol H₂O × 16.0 g/mol O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 mol O/mol O₂ × 16.0 g/mol O) = 3.20 g + 0.80 g = 4.00 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 mol N/mol N₂ × 14.0 g/mol N = 2.80 g\n\nTotal mass of products = 0.40 g + 4.00 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture. This confirms that the salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Since they decompose completely into gases, they must be ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxoanions.\n\n**3. Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of two salts, let's say `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B. The total decomposition reaction is:\n`n A + n B → 0.10 N₂ + 0.025 O₂ + 0.20 H₂O`\n\nLet's look for known decomposition reactions of simple ammonium salts that could produce this mixture of gases.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** At high temperatures (above 250-300°C), its decomposition is 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). This can be written for one mole as: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂(g) + 0.5O₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n\nLet's assume A is NH₄NO₂ and B is NH₄NO₃. Now, let's see if the reaction of `n` moles of each matches the observed products.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `n` mol N₂, `0.5n` mol O₂, and `2n` mol H₂O.\n\n**Total products:**\n*   Total N₂ = `n + n = 2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0 + 0.5n = 0.5n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n + 2n = 4n`\n\nNow, we equate these to our calculated moles of products:\n*   For N₂: `2n = 0.10` mol → `n = 0.05` mol\n*   For O₂: `0.5n = 0.025` mol → `n = 0.05` mol\n*   For H₂O: `4n = 0.20` mol → `n = 0.05` mol\n\nAll calculations consistently yield `n = 0.05` mol. This strongly supports our hypothesis that the mixture consists of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\nLet's run a final check with the initial mass.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.0+4(1.0)+14.0+2(16.0) = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.0+4(1.0)+14.0+3(16.0) = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass perfectly.\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂\n    *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃\n    *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in A and B:**\n    *   Total = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe result matches option C.\n```python\n# Final calculation check\n# Moles of H2O from 3.60 g\nm_h2o = 3.60\nmw_h2o = 18.0\nn_h2o = m_h2o / mw_h2o\n\n# Moles of O2 from 0.80 g\nm_o2 = 0.80\nmw_o2 = 32.0\nn_o2 = m_o2 / mw_o2\n\n# Moles of N2 from 2.24 L at STP\nvol_n2 = 2.24\nmolar_vol_stp = 22.4\nn_n2 = vol_n2 / molar_vol_stp\n\n# Total mass check from elements\nmass_N = n_n2 * 2 * 14.0\nmass_H = n_h2o * 2 * 1.0\nmass_O = (n_h2o * 1 * 16.0) + (n_o2 * 2 * 16.0)\ntotal_mass_products = mass_N + mass_H + mass_O\n\n# Molar masses of hypothesized salts\nmw_nh4no2 = 14 + 4*1 + 14 + 2*16\nmw_nh4no3 = 14 + 4*1 + 14 + 3*16\n\n# Based on our derivation, n=0.05 moles of each salt\nn = 0.05\ntotal_mass_salts = n * mw_nh4no2 + n * mw_nh4no3\n\n# Number of atoms\natoms_nh4no2 = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2\natoms_nh4no3 = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3\ntotal_atoms = atoms_nh4no2 + atoms_nh4no3\n\nprint(f\"Moles of H2O: {n_h2o}\")\nprint(f\"Moles of O2: {n_o2}\")\nprint(f\"Moles of N2: {n_n2}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass of products: {total_mass_products:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass of 0.05 mol of NH4NO2 and 0.05 mol of NH4NO3: {total_mass_salts:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO2: {atoms_nh4no2}\")\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO3: {atoms_nh4no3}\")\nprint(f\"Total atoms in salts A and B: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "**1. Deconstruct the experiment and identify the products.**\n\n*   The initial sample is an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, weighing 7.20 g.\n*   Upon heating, the salts decompose completely into a mixture of gases.\n*   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes:\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of O₂ that reacted.\n    *   **Remaining gas (C):** A volume of 2.24 L of gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the previous reagents.\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of each product.**\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):**\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 1.0*2 + 16.0 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O₂):**\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 16.0*2 = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C:**\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given that the initial salts are likely nitrogen compounds (a common component of salts that decompose into gases) and the gas is inert in this setup, Gas C is very likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Determine the empirical composition of the original mixture.**\n\nThe original 7.20 g mixture must have contained only the elements found in the products: Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n*   **Mass of Hydrogen (H):** 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 mol H/mol H₂O × 1.0 g/mol H = 0.40 g\n*   **Mass of Oxygen (O):** (0.20 mol H₂O × 16.0 g/mol O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 32.0 g/mol O₂) = 3.20 g + 0.80 g = 4.00 g\n*   **Mass of Nitrogen (N):** 0.10 mol N₂ × 28.0 g/mol N₂ = 2.80 g\n\n*   **Total Mass Check:** 0.40 g (H) + 4.00 g (O) + 2.80 g (N) = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe decomposition of ammonium salts of oxyacids of nitrogen often produces N₂, O₂, and H₂O. Let's consider two common ones: ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g), which simplifies to: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂(g) + ½O₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture of A and B was equimolar. Let's assume it contained `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B. Let A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O are produced.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃: `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O are produced.\n\n**Total moles of products:**\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O₂ = 0 + `0.5n` = `0.5n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nNow, let's use our calculated moles of products to find `n`:\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  =>  `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   From N₂: `2n` = 0.10 mol    =>  `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   From H₂O: `4n` = 0.20 mol   =>  `n` = 0.05 mol.\n\nAll calculations consistently give `n` = 0.05 mol. This confirms that the salts A and B are indeed ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
