    "**1. Analysis of Compound X from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, where the hydrogen bonding causes significant broadening.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are in the region for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, appearing as a broad singlet far downfield, is the classic chemical shift for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis (let's piece together the second substituent):**\n        *   We have four signals corresponding to the alkyl group: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n        *   The signal at **0.9 ppm** is a triplet (t) integrating to 3H, which means it's a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH₂ group.\n        *   The signal at **1.7 ppm** is a multiplet (m) integrating to 2H. This corresponds to the -CH₂- group, which is adjacent to the -CH₃ at 0.9 ppm. This confirms an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   The signal at **1.4 ppm** is a doublet (d) integrating to 3H, which means it's a -CH₃ group adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n        *   The signal at **2.9 ppm** is a multiplet (m) integrating to 1H. This must be the -CH- proton. It's shifted downfield because it is benzylic (attached directly to the aromatic ring). It is coupled to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm (making it a quartet) and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm (making it a triplet). The combination results in a complex multiplet.\n        *   Assembling the fragments: The benzylic carbon (-CH- at 2.9 ppm) is attached to both a methyl group (-CH₃ at 1.4 ppm) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃ at 1.7 and 0.9 ppm). This structure is a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion from NMR:** The full structure of Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This matches option C.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Transformation:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkanes (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and other saturated alkyl groups are unaffected under these conditions.\n*   **Reaction Equation:**\n    *   Starting Material (Compound X): 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.\n    *   Final Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\n*   We compare our predicted product, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, with the given options.\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl group.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our derived product.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
