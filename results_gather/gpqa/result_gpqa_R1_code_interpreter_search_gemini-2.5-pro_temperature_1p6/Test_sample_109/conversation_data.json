    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Define Observability Criteria\n\nTo be detected by *both* the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, a star must meet two conditions:\n1.  **Geographical Visibility:** It must be visible from both observatory locations.\n2.  **Magnitude Limit:** Its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the limits of both instruments.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Common Geographical Visibility (Declination Range)\n\nAn object's visibility in the sky depends on its declination (DEC) and the observer's latitude. The problem states to disregard pointing limits like minimum elevation, which means we should consider the theoretical horizon as the limit.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESO):**\n    *   Latitude (λ) ≈ -24.6° (Southern Hemisphere).\n    *   A star at Paranal can theoretically be observed if its declination is above the southern horizon (DEC > λ - 90°) and below the northern horizon. The northernmost declination that can rise above the horizon is given by DEC < 90° - |λ| = 90° - 24.6° = **+65.4°**.\n    *   So, for Paranal, the declination must be **DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory:**\n    *   Latitude (λ) ≈ +19.8° (Northern Hemisphere).\n    *   A star at Keck can theoretically be observed if its declination is above the southern horizon. The southernmost declination that can rise above the horizon is given by DEC > λ - 90° = 19.8° - 90° = **-70.2°**.\n    *   So, for Keck, the declination must be **DEC > -70.2°**.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be within the intersection of these two ranges:\n**-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Combined Magnitude Limit\n\n*   ESPRESSO limit: Apparent V magnitude < 17 mag.\n*   HIRES limit: Apparent V magnitude < 16 mag.\n\nTo be detected by **both**, a star must satisfy the stricter of the two limits.\nTherefore, the required apparent V magnitude (`m_v`) is **`m_v` < 16 mag**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Each Star\n\nWe will now check each star against the combined criteria: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°** and **`m_v` < 16**.\n\nFor stars where the absolute magnitude (Mv) is given, we will calculate the apparent magnitude (mv) using the distance modulus formula:\n`m_v = M_v + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_v`\nwhere `d` is the distance in parsecs and `A_v` is the interstellar extinction in the V band. The extinction is calculated as `A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_stars():\n    # --- Observatory Criteria ---\n    paranal_lat = -24.6\n    keck_lat = 19.8\n    dec_max = 90 - abs(paranal_lat)\n    dec_min = keck_lat - 90\n    \n    mag_limit_espresso = 17.0\n    mag_limit_hires = 16.0\n    combined_mag_limit = min(mag_limit_espresso, mag_limit_hires)\n\n    # --- Star Data ---\n    stars = {\n        \"Star1\": {\"RA_deg\": 15, \"DEC_deg\": -75, \"Mv\": 15.5, \"d_pc\": 10, \"E(B-V)\": 0},\n        \"Star2\": {\"RA_deg\": 30, \"DEC_deg\": 55, \"mv\": 16.5, \"d_pc\": 5},\n        \"Star3\": {\"RA_h\": 11, \"DEC_deg\": 48, \"mv\": 15.5, \"d_pc\": 15},\n        \"Star4\": {\"RA_deg\": 85, \"DEC_deg\": -48, \"Mv\": 15.5, \"d_pc\": 10, \"E(B-V)\": 0.4},\n        \"Star5\": {\"RA_h\": 10, \"DEC_deg\": 60, \"Mv\": 16.5, \"d_pc\": 5, \"E(B-V)\": 0},\n    }\n\n    # --- Analysis ---\n    print(f\"Observability Criteria:\")\n    print(f\"Declination Range: {dec_min:.1f} < DEC < {dec_max:.1f} deg\")\n    print(f\"Magnitude Limit: V < {combined_mag_limit:.1f} mag\\n\")\n\n    observable_stars = []\n\n    for name, data in stars.items():\n        print(f\"--- Analyzing {name} ---\")\n        dec = data[\"DEC_deg\"]\n        \n        # 1.

    "To determine which stars can be observed by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Geographical Visibility:** The star's declination (DEC) must be within a range that is visible from both observatories.\n2.  **Magnitude Limit:** The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the stricter of the two instrument limits.\n\n### Step 1: Establish the Combined Observational Criteria\n\n**1. Geographical Visibility (Declination Range):**\nA star is visible from an observatory if it rises above the horizon. The range of declinations visible from a given latitude (`λ`) is between `λ - 90°` and `λ + 90°`. For an object to be observable, it must cross the horizon.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory:**\n    *   Latitude (`λ_Paranal`) ≈ -24.6° S\n    *   The northernmost declination visible is `90° - |λ_Paranal|` = `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. Any star with DEC < +65.4° will rise above Paranal's horizon.\n*   **Keck Observatory:**\n    *   Latitude (`λ_Keck`) ≈ +19.8° N\n    *   The southernmost declination visible is `λ_Keck - 90°` = `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`. Any star with DEC > -70.2° will rise above Keck's horizon.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must lie in the overlapping range:\n**-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**\n\n**2. Magnitude Limit:**\n*   ESPRESSO limit: `V_mag < 17`\n*   HIRES limit: `V_mag < 16`\nTo be observed by **both**, a star must meet the more stringent requirement:\n**Apparent V magnitude < 16.0**\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Star Against the Criteria\n\nWe will now evaluate each star. For stars given with an absolute magnitude (`M_v`), we will calculate the apparent magnitude (`m_v`) using the distance modulus formula, including extinction (`A_v`) where applicable:\n`m_v = M_v + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_v`\nwhere `A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n---\n\n**Star1**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** -75°. This is outside the common visibility range (-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°) because it is too far south to be seen from Keck Observatory.\n*   **Verdict:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star2**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** +55°. This is within the common visibility range.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_v):** 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the required limit of `< 16.0 mag`.\n*   **Verdict:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star3**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** +48°. This is within the common visibility range.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_v):** 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the required limit of `< 16.0 mag`.\n*   **Verdict:** **Observable by both.**\n\n**Star4**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** -48°. This is within the common visibility range.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_v):** Must be calculated.\n    *   `M_v` = 15.5 mag\n    *   `d` = 10 pc\n    *   `E(B-V)` = 0.4 mag\n    *   `A_v` = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   `m_v` = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**.\n    *   This is fainter than the required limit of `< 16.0 mag`.\n*   **Verdict:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star5**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** +60°. This is within the common visibility range.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_v):** Must be calculated.\n    *   `M_v` = 16.5 mag\n    *   `d` = 5 pc\n    *   `E(B-V)` = 0 (not mentioned, assumed to be negligible)\n    *   `A_v` = 0\n    *   `m_v` = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0 = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**.\n    *   This is brighter than the required limit of `< 16.0 mag`.\n*   **Verdict:** **Observable by both.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, only **Star 3** and **Star 5** meet both the geographical and magnitude requirements to be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n<<<C>>>"
