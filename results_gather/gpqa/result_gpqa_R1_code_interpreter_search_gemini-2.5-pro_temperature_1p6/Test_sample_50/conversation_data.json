    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the System and the Method**\n    The problem involves a point charge `q` near a grounded conducting sphere. A \"grounded\" sphere means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V=0). This problem is a classic example in electrostatics that is best solved using the \"method of images.\"\n\n2.  **The Method of Images**\n    The electric field and potential *outside* the conducting sphere can be accurately described by replacing the sphere with a hypothetical \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed at a specific location (`d'`) inside the sphere. The potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) due to the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must sum to zero to satisfy the grounded condition.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge and its Location**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance from the center `d'` are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d`\n\n    The image charge is located on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**\n    The potential energy `U` of the system can be calculated as the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A more direct method is to use the formula for electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n    `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`\n    Where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n    In our case, the system consists of the point charge `q` and the induced charges on the surface of the sphere. The formula becomes:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_sphere_at_q + (1/2) * ∫(sphere surface) σ * V_on_sphere * dA`\n\n    *   Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface `V_on_sphere` is 0. Therefore, the second term `(1/2) * ∫ σ * V_on_sphere * dA` is zero.\n    *   `V_sphere_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` that is created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n    So, the formula simplifies to:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_sphere_at_q`\n\n5.  **Finding the Potential at `q` due to the Sphere**\n    According to the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere (`V_sphere_at_q`) is exactly the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n    *   The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The image charge `q'` is at a distance `d' = R^2 / d` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `Δx = d - d'`.\n    *   The potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_sphere_at_q = k * q' / (d - d')`\n\n6.  **Substituting and Solving**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'` into the potential equation:\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n\n    Simplify the denominator:\n    `d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    Substitute this back into the potential equation:\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\n    The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancel out:\n    `V_sphere_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation of Potential Energy**\n    Finally, substitute this potential back into our simplified energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_sphere_at_q`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n8.  **Comparing with the Options**\n    This result matches option D.\n    A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\n<<<D>>>"
