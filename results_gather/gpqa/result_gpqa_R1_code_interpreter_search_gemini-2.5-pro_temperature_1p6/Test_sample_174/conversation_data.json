    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution confined to a spheroid shape. An oscillating charge distribution is a source of electromagnetic radiation. The spheroid shape, with a defined symmetry axis (z-axis), suggests that the radiation will have a specific directional pattern.\n\n2.  **Model the Radiation Source:** For radiation with a wavelength `λ` much larger than the size of the source (the spheroid), the source can be modeled by its lowest-order multipole moment. An oscillating charge distribution will, in general, have a time-varying electric dipole moment. Let's assume the oscillation occurs along the z-axis (the symmetry axis of the spheroid). This creates an oscillating electric dipole with its moment `p(t)` aligned with the z-axis. This is the simplest and most common model for such a source, and it's the one that leads to the angular dependence patterns given in introductory physics.\n\n3.  **Recall the Formula for Electric Dipole Radiation:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` from an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * ω^4 * sin^2(θ)`\n    where:\n    *   `θ` is the angle between the observation direction and the dipole axis (the z-axis).\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillation.\n    *   `C` is a constant that includes the amplitude of the dipole moment, the speed of light, and the permittivity of free space.\n\n    The problem states that this power per unit solid angle is a function `f(λ, θ)`. So, `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Angular Dependence:**\n    The power radiated depends on the angle `θ` through the term `sin^2(θ)`.\n    *   `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin^2(θ)`\n    The maximum radiated power, denoted by `A`, occurs when `sin^2(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin^2(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (or `π/2` radians). This means the radiation is strongest in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis.\n    *   `A = (dP/dΩ)_max ∝ sin^2(90°) = 1`\n    We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. Let's call this `P_30`.\n    *   `P_30 = (dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°) ∝ sin^2(30°)`\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4`.\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `30°` is the ratio `P_30 / A`.\n    *   Fraction = `P_30 / A = sin^2(30°) / sin^2(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Wavelength Dependence:**\n    Now let's determine how the function `f` depends on the wavelength `λ`. The formula for `f(λ, θ)` includes the term `ω^4`. The angular frequency `ω` is related to the frequency `ν` and the wavelength `λ` by:\n    *   `ω = 2πν`\n    *   `c = νλ`  (where `c` is the speed of light)\n    From the second equation, we can express the frequency `ν` as `ν = c/λ`. Substituting this into the first equation:\n    *   `ω = 2π(c/λ)`\n    Now we can see how the `ω^4` term depends on `λ`:\n    *   `ω^4 = (2πc/λ)^4 = (2πc)^4 * (1/λ^4)`\n    Since `2πc` is a constant, the power radiated is proportional to `1/λ^4`.\n    *   `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ ∝ ω^4 ∝ 1/λ^4 = λ^(-4)`\n    This shows that a possible form for `f` includes a `λ^(-4)` dependence. This is a very famous result, related to Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue (shorter wavelengths like blue scatter more strongly).\n\n6.  **Combine the Results and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n    *   A possible form of the function `f` (representing the power dependence) includes the term **`λ^(-4)`**.\n\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 1/2, `λ^(-4)`\n    B) 1/4, `λ^(-3)`\n    C) 1/4, `λ^(-4)`\n    D) 3/4, `λ^(-6)`\n\n    The correct option is C, which matches both of our derived results.\n\n<<<C>>>"
