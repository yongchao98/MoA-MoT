    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Variables and Initial Conditions\n\n*   **Initial nucleus:**\n    *   Rest mass: M\n    *   Rest-mass energy: E_M = M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n    *   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is 0 and its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy.\n\n*   **Final fragments:**\n    *   Rest mass of the more massive fragment: m1\n    *   Rest mass of the less massive fragment: m2\n    *   Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment: T1\n    *   Kinetic energy of the less massive fragment: T2\n\n*   **Given relationships:**\n    1.  m1 = 2 * m2 (One fragment is twice as massive as the other).\n    2.  m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M (The sum of fragment rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass).\n\n### 2. Calculate Rest Energies of the Fragments\n\nFirst, we determine the rest masses (and thus rest energies) of the two fragments in terms of the initial nucleus.\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  m1 = 2 * m2\n2.  m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\nm2 = 0.33 * M\n\nNow, find m1:\nm1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNow, we can find their rest energies:\n*   Rest energy of fragment 1 (m1): E1_rest = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**.\n*   Rest energy of fragment 2 (m2): E2_rest = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the fission must equal the total energy after.\n    E_initial = E_final\n    M * c^2 = (m1 * c^2 + T1) + (m2 * c^2 + T2)\n    300 GeV = (198 GeV + T1) + (99 GeV + T2)\n    300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2\n    This gives us the total kinetic energy released in the fission (also known as the Q-value):\n    **Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. The total final momentum must also be zero.\n    p_initial = 0\n    p_final = p1 + p2 = 0\n    This means the two fragments fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude:\n    **|p1| = |p2| = p**\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the relationship between kinetic energy (T) and momentum (p) is:\nT = p^2 / (2m), or p^2 = 2mT\n\nUsing the momentum conservation principle (p1^2 = p2^2):\n2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical\nm1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical\n\nSince m1 = 2 * m2:\n2 * m2 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical\nT2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy from the conservation of energy:\nT1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV\nT1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV\n3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\nT1_classical = 1 GeV\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, using the classical approximation, is **1000 MeV**.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is:\nE^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2\n\nSince total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy (E = m*c^2 + T), we can write:\n(m*c^2 + T)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2\n(p*c)^2 = (m*c^2 + T)^2 - (m*c^2)^2\n(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2 * T * (m*c^2)\n\nFrom momentum conservation, (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2. Let T1 be the correct relativistic kinetic energy T1_rel.\nT1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)\n\nWe substitute the known values:\n*   T2 = 3 - T1 (from T1 + T2 = 3 GeV)\n*   m1*c^2 = 198 GeV\n*   m2*c^2 = 99 GeV\n\nT1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)\nT1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)\nT1^2 + 396 * T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603\n\nThe T1^2 terms cancel out:\n396 * T1 = -204 * T1 + 603\n396 * T1 + 204 * T1 = 603\n600 * T1 = 603\nT1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is **1005 MeV**.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\nDifference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\nDifference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV\nDifference = 5 MeV\n\n<<<A>>>"
