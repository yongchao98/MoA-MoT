    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone and bromine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In the presence of an acid or base catalyst (usually present as an impurity or added intentionally), one of the α-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is substituted by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** The product is 2-bromocyclohexan-1-one.\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-bromocyclohexan-1-one (an α-halo ketone) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base), with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. The hydroxide ion deprotonates the other α-carbon (C6) to form an enolate. This enolate then undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one). The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained three-membered ring. The more stable carbanion is formed by cleaving the C1-C6 bond, which is subsequently protonated (during workup) to yield a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, thionyl chloride, and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlH(OtBu)₃ is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n     \n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the cyclopentane ring through the C3-C4 bond.\n\nLet's count the distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. That's **1** signal.\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the only hydrogen on the carbon atom that links the ring to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. That's **1** signal.\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Each carbon has two protons. The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (not equivalent) because C1 is a stereocenter (in a hypothetical sense). The same is true for C5. By symmetry, the \"top\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"top\" proton on C5, and the \"bottom\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"bottom\" proton on C5. Therefore, these four protons give rise to **2** distinct signals.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the four protons on these two carbons are diastereotopic and will give rise to **2** distinct signals.\n\n**Total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms:**\nTotal signals = 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1 H) + 2 (from C2/C5 Hs) + 2 (from C3/C4 Hs) = **6**.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
