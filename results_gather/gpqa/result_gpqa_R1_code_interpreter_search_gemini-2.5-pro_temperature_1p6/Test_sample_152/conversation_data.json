These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nB) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nC) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nD) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOCH₃)₂). The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon between the two ester groups, creating a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate): `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon bonded to the p-tolyl group) is the electrophilic site for conjugate addition.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and subsequently, the C=O π-electrons shift to the oxygen, forming an enolate intermediate.\n    3.  This intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) during workup to yield the final product.\n*   **Product (A) Structure:**\n    The new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    p-Tolyl-CH(β)-CH(α)₂-COOCH₃ + `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃\n    To name this compound, we can consider it a substituted propane tricarboxylate. The main chain is a three-carbon chain with carboxylate groups.\n    (H₃COOC)₂CH(1)-CH(p-tolyl)(2)-CH₂(3)-COOCH₃\n    This is named **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a neutral nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine double bond (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is part of the Stork enamine synthesis.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the one bonded to the methyl group) is the electrophilic site.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium salt intermediate and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion, which is quickly protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    3.  The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a ketone, removing the piperidine.\n*   **Product (B) Structure:**\n    The reaction adds a ` -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group to the α-carbon (C2) of the original cyclohexanone.\n    The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position.\n    Naming this molecule as a substituted butanenitrile: The parent chain is butanenitrile. At position 3, there is a cyclohexyl ring which has a ketone group at position 2 relative to the point of attachment.\n    Therefore, the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Analysis:** This is a retrosynthesis problem. We are given the product and one reactant, and we need to find the other reactant (C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), which has the structure CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:**\n    1.  A Michael addition forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    2.  The product structure is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring with a ` -CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) group at position 2.\n    3.  The fragment added from the Michael acceptor (MVK) is ` -CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-C(=O)CH₃`. This perfectly matches the 3-oxobutyl substituent.\n    4.  Therefore, the Michael donor must have been the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic proton at C2 (between the two carbonyls) to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Reactant (C) Structure:**\n    Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nComparing this with the given choices, option A matches all three results.\n\n<<<A>>>"
