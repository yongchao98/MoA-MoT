    "This problem requires us to determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product formed from a specific chemical reaction.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant:**\n    The starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down this name to draw its structure and find its molecular formula.\n    *   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n    *   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is attached. By convention, this is at position 1.\n    *   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group is at position 2.\n    *   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group is at position 5.\n\n    The structure is as follows:\n        C(6)H₂ -- C(1)H(COOH) -- C(2)H(CHO) -- C(3)H\n        |                                        ||\n        C(5)H(CH=CH₂) ------------------------- C(4)H\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\n    Let's count the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):**\n        *   Ring: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H₂) -> 7 H\n        *   Groups: -COOH(H), -CHO(H), -CH=CH₂(3H) -> 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 H\n        *   Total H = 7 + 5 = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    The molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the IHD of the Reactant (Optional but good for verification):**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) can be calculated from the structure:\n    *   1 for the ring.\n    *   1 for the C=C bond in the ring.\n    *   1 for the C=C bond in the vinyl group.\n    *   1 for the C=O bond in the formyl group.\n    *   1 for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   Total IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n4.  **Identify the Reagent and the Reaction:**\n    The reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent used for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturation (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding alkanes.\n    The reaction will cause the following changes:\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring (C=C) is reduced to a single bond (C-C).\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure and Molecular Formula of the Product:**\n    The reaction transforms the reactant into a saturated substituted cycloalkane.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The substituents become a methyl group at position 1, another methyl group at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 5 (using the original numbering).\n    *   The product is an isomer of ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane (specifically, 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane based on IUPAC nomenclature for the product).\n\n    Let's determine the molecular formula of the product:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** The number of carbon atoms remains unchanged. C = 10.\n    *   **Product type:** The product is a substituted cycloalkane. A monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane with no other rings or double bonds) has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n    *   For n=10, the formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The IHD formula is `IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`. For the product **C₁₀H₂₀**:\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   N = 0 (no nitrogen)\n    *   `IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1`\n    *   `IHD = 10 - 10 + 1`\n    *   `IHD = 1`\n\n    Alternatively, we can inspect the structure of the product. It is a single saturated ring with alkyl substituents. The IHD is simply the number of rings in the molecule.\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of π bonds = 0\n    *   Total IHD = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\nTo double-check the simple calculation, we can use the python interpreter:\n```python\n# Molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\nC = 10\nH = 20\nN = 0 # No nitrogen atoms.\n# Formula for Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD): IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\nIHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\nprint(int(IHD))\n```\n1\n\nThe result is 1.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n<<<C>>>",
    "### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n    *   The parent structure is a **cyclohex-3-ene** ring: a 6-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n    *   At position 1, there is a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH).\n    *   At position 2, there is a **formyl** (aldehyde) group (-CHO).\n    *   At position 5, there is a **vinyl** group (-CH=CH₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\n    Let's count the atoms to find the molecular formula.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 from -COOH + 1 from -CHO + 2 from the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** Let's draw the structure to count hydrogens:\n        *   Ring positions: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H₂) -> 7 H on the ring.\n        *   Substituents: -COOH (1 H), -CHO (1 H), -CH=CH₂ (3 H) -> 5 H on the substituents.\n        *   Total hydrogens = 7 + 5 = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reagent and its Function:**\n    The reagent is **red phosphorus with excess hydroiodic acid (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of almost all functional groups.\n    *   It reduces carbonyl groups (both aldehydes and carboxylic acids) to alkane groups (-CH₂- or -CH₃).\n    *   It reduces alkene groups (C=C double bonds) to alkane groups (C-C single bonds).\n    *   It reduces alcohols to alkanes.\n\n4.  **Predict the Product of the Reaction:**\n    Applying the reducing action of Red P + HI to our reactant:\n    *   The **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) at position 1 will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The **formyl** group (-CHO) at position 2 will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The **double bond in the cyclohexene ring** will be reduced to a single bond, making it a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at position 5 will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   All oxygen atoms will be removed.\n\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. The carbon skeleton is preserved. The product is an isomer of 1,2-dimethyl-4-ethylcyclohexane.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of the Product:**\n    The product is a saturated cycloalkane (a hydrocarbon with one ring and no double or triple bonds). The general formula for a cycloalkane is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n    *   Since the number of carbon atoms does not change during the reaction, the product has 10 carbon atoms (n = 10).\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) tells us the number of rings plus the number of π-bonds in a molecule.\n    The formula for IHD is: `IHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1`\n    For the product C₁₀H₂₀:\n    *   C = 10 (number of carbons)\n    *   H = 20 (number of hydrogens)\n    *   N = 0 (number of nitrogens)\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + (0/2) + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 0 + 1\n    *   IHD = 1\n\n    Alternatively, we can look at the structure of the product. It is a single saturated ring (cyclohexane) with alkyl chains attached.\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of π-bonds = 0\n    *   Total IHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
