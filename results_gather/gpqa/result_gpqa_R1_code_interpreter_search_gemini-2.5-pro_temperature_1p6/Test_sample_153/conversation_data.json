    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of spectroscopic data (Mass Spectrometry, IR, and ¹H NMR) to deduce the structure of an unknown compound from a given list of options.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molar mass of the molecule containing the most abundant isotopes of its constituent atoms.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. Its relative intensity is 32% of the M+ peak (100%). This M+ / M+2 intensity ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale sign of a molecule containing a single **chlorine** atom (due to the natural abundance of isotopes ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The unknown molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's check the molecular weights of the options (using C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35):\n*   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅ClO₂): 7*12 + 5*1 + 35 + 2*16 = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. (Matches)\n*   B) Phenyl chloroformate (C₇H₅ClO₂): 7*12 + 5*1 + 35 + 2*16 = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. (Matches)\n*   C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): 7*12 + 5*1 + 35 + 2*16 = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. (Matches)\n*   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): 7*12 + 5*1 + 35 + 2*16 = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. (Matches)\n\nAll options have the correct molecular formula and weight, so we need to rely on the other spectral data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the very broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid** functional group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option A (an aldehyde/phenol) and option B (a chloroformate, which would lack the broad O-H stretch). We are left with options C and D.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is highly indicative of a **carboxylic acid proton**. The signal is a singlet ('s') and integrates to one proton ('1H'), which is fully consistent with a -COOH group.\n*   **Aromatic Region (7-9 ppm):** We have two signals in the aromatic region:\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n*   **Interpretation of the Aromatic Region:** This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring results in only two unique types of aromatic protons. Each type of proton has only one adjacent proton on the ring, hence they appear as doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule must have a para-substituted benzene ring. Let's look at the remaining options:\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in a *para* (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring. This structure would produce the observed pattern of two doublets in the ¹H NMR. The protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing COOH group are expected to be further downfield (~8.02 ppm) than the protons adjacent to the chlorine atom (~7.72 ppm).\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *ortho* (1,2) substituted. It lacks the symmetry of the para isomer and would have four unique aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum (not two simple doublets).\n\n### Final Synthesis\n\nAll pieces of data point to a single structure.\n*   **MS:** Confirms MW = 156 and one Cl atom.\n*   **IR:** Confirms a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Confirms the carboxylic acid proton and shows a *para*-disubstituted aromatic ring pattern.\n\nOnly **4-chlorobenzoic acid (C)** fits all the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
