    "This is a question about the solar neutrino spectrum and the contributions of different nuclear reactions within the Sun's core.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** The Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions, primarily the proton-proton (pp) chain and, to a lesser extent, the CNO cycle. These reactions produce neutrinos with different energy spectra. Let's list the relevant ones for the energy bands in question (700-900 keV):\n    *   **pp-I chain:** Produces \"pp\" neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to 420 keV. This is outside our bands of interest.\n    *   **pp-II chain:** Produces \"⁷Be\" neutrinos via electron capture on Beryllium-7 (⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νₑ). This is not a continuous spectrum but a sharp energy line, with the vast majority (about 90%) of these neutrinos having an energy of **861 keV**.\n    *   **pp-III chain:** Produces \"⁸B\" (Boron-8) neutrinos from the decay ⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νₑ. This produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos with high energies, extending up to about 15 MeV. These neutrinos contribute to the flux in both the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands.\n    *   **CNO cycle:** Produces neutrinos from the decays of ¹³N and ¹⁵O. These have continuous spectra that also extend into the energy bands we are considering.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hypothetical Change:** The problem states that the pp-III branch suddenly stops. This means the production of **⁸B neutrinos ceases entirely**. The question also specifies that all other reactions continue as they were. This is a crucial simplifying assumption. The event happened 8.5 minutes ago, which is the travel time for neutrinos from the Sun to Earth, so we are observing the immediate effect of this change.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Flux in Each Band *After* the Change:**\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   `pp` neutrinos? No, their energy is too low (< 420 keV).\n        *   `⁷Be` neutrinos? No, their main energy line is at 861 keV.\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos? No, this reaction has stopped.\n        *   `CNO` neutrinos? Yes, their continuous spectra from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays extend through this range.\n        *   Therefore, the only source of neutrinos in Band 1 is the CNO cycle.\n\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   `⁷Be` neutrinos? **Yes.** The very strong, monoenergetic line at 861 keV falls directly into this band.\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos? No, this reaction has stopped.\n        *   `CNO` neutrinos? Yes, the CNO spectra also contribute a small continuous background flux in this band.\n        *   Therefore, the flux in Band 2 is composed of the very significant ⁷Be line plus a small contribution from the CNO cycle.\n\n4.  **Compare the Fluxes and Calculate the Ratio:**\n    *   Flux (Band 1) is solely due to the CNO cycle. In a star like our Sun, the CNO cycle accounts for only about 1% of the total energy production, and its associated neutrino flux is significantly lower than the flux from the pp-chain branches.\n    *   Flux (Band 2) is dominated by the intense ⁷Be neutrino line at 861 keV.\n    *   The flux from the ⁷Be line is significantly higher—by about two orders of magnitude (a factor of ~100)—than the CNO flux at the same energy.\n    *   Therefore, we are comparing a small value (CNO flux) with a much larger value (⁷Be flux).\n\n    The ratio is:\n    Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) = (Flux from CNO) / (Flux from ⁷Be line + Flux from CNO)\n\n    Since the ⁷Be flux is vastly larger than the CNO flux, the denominator is dominated by the ⁷Be flux. The ratio is approximately:\n    (Small CNO flux) / (Large ⁷Be flux)\n\n    This results in a value much less than 1. Looking at the standard solar model data, the ⁷Be line flux is about 100 times greater than the CNO flux in the relevant energy region.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio is approximately 1 / 100, which is 0.01.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The flux in the 700-800 keV band becomes very small (only CNO neutrinos), while the flux in the 800-900 keV band remains very high due to the strong ⁷Be line. The ratio of the former to the latter is therefore very small, on the order of 10⁻².\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Band 1 (700-800 keV) -> Only CNO flux (low).\n*   Band 2 (800-900 keV) -> Dominated by ⁷Be line flux (high).\n*   Ratio = Low / High ≈ 0.01.\nThe choice B matches this reasoning.\n\n<<<B>>>"
