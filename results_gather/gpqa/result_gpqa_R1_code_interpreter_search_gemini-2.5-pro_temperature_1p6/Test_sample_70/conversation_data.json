    "*   **Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n    The main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be expressed as T_eq,4 / T_eq,2.\n\n*   **Step 2: Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (its distance from the star, since orbits are circular).\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\n*   **Step 3: Set up the Ratio for the Two Planets**\n    We need to find the ratio T_eq,4 / T_eq,2.\n    T_eq,4 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_4))^(1/2) * (1 - A_4)^(1/4)\n    T_eq,2 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)\n\n    When we divide T_eq,4 by T_eq,2, several terms cancel out:\n    *   The star's temperature (T_star) and radius (R_star) are the same for both planets.\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo (A_4 = A_2).\n    *   The constant '2' also cancels.\n\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (1 / a_4)^(1/2) / (1 / a_2)^(1/2)\n    T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\n*   **Step 4: Relate Semi-major Axis (a) to Orbital Period (P)**\n    We are given the ratio of orbital periods (P), not the semi-major axes (a). We can use Kepler's Third Law to relate these two quantities. Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    P² ∝ a³\n    Rearranging this for `a`, we get:\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n*   **Step 5: Substitute the Period-Axis Relationship into the Temperature Ratio**\n    Now we can substitute the relationship a ∝ P^(2/3) into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = ( (P_2)^(2/3) / (P_4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)\n    T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n    This shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is equal to the cube root of the inverse ratio of their orbital periods.\n\n*   **Step 6: Use the Given Period Ratios to Calculate the Final Answer**\n    The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    From this, we have:\n    *   The period value for Planet_2 (P_2) is 2.\n    *   The period value for Planet_4 (P_4) is 3.5.\n\n    Now, we plug these values into our final equation:\n    T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n    To compute the numerical value, we can use a simple python script.\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4\nP2 = 2\nP4 = 3.5\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = (P2 / P4)**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.829828590393275\n</execute_result>\n\n*   **Step 7: Conclusion**\n    The calculation shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature T_eq of a planet is related to its semi-major axis 'a' by the formula T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2).\nFrom Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period 'P' is related to the semi-major axis 'a' by P² ∝ a³, which means a ∝ P^(2/3).\n\nBy substituting the relationship for 'a' into the temperature proportionality, we get:\nT_eq ∝ (1/P^(2/3))^(1/2)\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is:\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nSo, we can use the relative values P_2 = 2 and P_4 = 3.5.\n\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
