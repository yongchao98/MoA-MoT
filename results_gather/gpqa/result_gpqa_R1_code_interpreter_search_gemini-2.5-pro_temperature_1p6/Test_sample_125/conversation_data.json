    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n    *   This molecule has one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is given as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol (-OH group).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction conditions.\n    *   The hydride attack on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two possible stereoisomers at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure ((S) at C5), the two products will be:\n        1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n        2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C3. Molecules that are stereoisomers but not mirror images of each other are called **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The reaction produces a mixture of two diastereomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This molecule is achiral and has no stereocenters.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Transformation:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces both ketone groups to alcohol groups, yielding pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Let's consider the (2R, 4S) isomer. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH2 group, making it achiral despite having two stereocenters. This is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer (they are superimposable).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The reaction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  **P1:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n2.  **P2:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (Diastereomer of P1)\n3.  **P3:** meso-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral)\n4.  **P4:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  **P5:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer of P4)\n\n(Note: P3, P4, and P5 are all diastereomers of P1 and P2).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity), but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Separation of Enantiomers:** P4 and P5 are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Separation of Diastereomers:**\n    *   P1 and P2 are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This will give **2 peaks**.\n    *   P3 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of P4 and P5. They will have different properties and will be separated. So, P3 will be one peak, and the {P4, P5} pair will be another peak. This will give **2 peaks** from the Reaction II products.\n*   **Overall Separation:** The products of Reaction I (C7 methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally very different molecules (constitutional isomers with respect to each other if we consider the set of atoms). They will have different polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Peak 1: P1\n    *   Peak 2: P2\n    *   Peak 3: P3\n    *   Peak 4: {P4 + P5} (co-eluting enantiomeric pair)\n    *   Therefore, a total of **4 peaks** will be observed.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   Each of the five stereoisomers (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5) will interact uniquely with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   **P1 and P2:** Diastereomers, will be separated. (2 peaks)\n    *   **P4 and P5:** Enantiomers, will be separated by the chiral column. (2 peaks)\n    *   **P3:** The meso compound is achiral, but it is a distinct stereoisomer. It will interact with the chiral stationary phase differently than P1, P2, P4, or P5. It will elute as a single, separate peak. (1 peak)\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 distinct stereoisomers will be resolved.\n    *   Peak 1: P1\n    *   Peak 2: P2\n    *   Peak 3: P3\n    *   Peak 4: P4\n    *   Peak 5: P5\n    *   Therefore, a total of **5 peaks** will be observed.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC** and **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
