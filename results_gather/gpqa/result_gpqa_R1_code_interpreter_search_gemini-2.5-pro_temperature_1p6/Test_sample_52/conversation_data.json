    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the core structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring with two substituents attached, which can be represented as `R1-C6H4-R2`. The `C6H4` fragment contributes 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms to the formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR data for the substituents:**\n\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". In a di-substituted benzene ring, a para (1,4) substitution pattern with two different substituents (R1 ≠ R2) gives two signals (typically two doublets) for the four aromatic protons due to the molecule's symmetry. This is the most common pattern that fits this description. So, we'll assume a para-substituted ring.\n\n    *   **Vinyl Protons and a Methyl Group:** There are \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a `–CH=CH–CH3` group (a propenyl group).\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the `CH3` is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the `CH3` group (into a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group, `–CH=CH–CH3`, as one of the substituents. This fragment contributes 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`–CH` + `–CH` + `–CH3`). It also accounts for one of the two `–CH3` signals mentioned.\n\n    *   **Ester Group and the Second Methyl Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group (`–COO–`), and the 1H NMR shows a second `–CH3` signal. Crucially, the spectrum shows **no signals for `–CH2` groups**. This means the ester group cannot be, for example, an ethyl ester (`–COO–CH2CH3`) or have a `–CH2–` spacer connecting it to the ring. The only simple ways to form an ester substituent that has a methyl group but no methylene group are:\n        *   A methyl ester group: `–COO–CH3`\n        *   An acetate group: `–O–CO–CH3`\n        In either case, this fragment contributes 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens to the molecule.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular formula:** Now, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n    *   **From the para-substituted aromatic ring:** `C6H4`\n    *   **From the propenyl group:** `C3H5`\n    *   **From the ester-containing group:** `C2H3O2`\n\n    Let's sum them up:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) C11H12O2\n    *   B) C11H14O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C12H14O2\n\n    Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option A perfectly.\n\n5.  **Eliminate other options:**\n    *   Options B (C11H14O2) and D (C12H14O2) have more hydrogen atoms. To add two hydrogens to our structure, the vinyl C=C double bond would need to be saturated (C–C), which would create `–CH2–` groups, contradicting the NMR data.\n    *   Option C (C12H12O2) has one extra carbon but the same number of hydrogens. It is not possible to add a carbon atom to the deduced structure without also adding hydrogens or violating the strict NMR signal requirements (e.g., creating a third methyl signal, adding more vinyl protons, or introducing a `CH2` group).\n\nTherefore, based on the comprehensive analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
