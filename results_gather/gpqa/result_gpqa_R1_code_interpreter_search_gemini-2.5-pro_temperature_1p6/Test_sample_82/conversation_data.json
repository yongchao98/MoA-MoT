    "This problem requires a two-part calculation for a titration process. First, we determine the pH at 25% titration, which is in the buffer region. Second, we calculate the pH at the equivalence point, where all the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base.\n\n**1. Initial State and Dilution**\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH): `moles = M * V = 0.05 mol/L * 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol`.\n*   The initial 20.00 cm³ of acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   Total volume after dilution: `V_total = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L`.\n*   Concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution: `[CH3COOH] = moles / V_total = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M`.\n\nThis is the solution being titrated.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO⁻), while 75% of the acetic acid remains. This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used for buffer solutions:\n    `pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])`\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)`\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base to acid is:\n    `[CH3COO⁻] / [CH3COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3`\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    `pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3)`\n    `pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) - log(3) = 4.732 - 0.477 = 4.255`\n    So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH.\n\n*   First, find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:\n    `moles(NaOH) = moles(CH3COOH)`\n    `M_naoh * V_eq = 0.001 mol`\n    `0.1 M * V_eq = 0.001 mol`\n    `V_eq = 0.010 L = 10.00 mL`\n*   At this point, 0.001 mol of acetate (CH3COO⁻) has been formed.\n*   The total volume of the solution is:\n    `V_total = V_acid + V_naoh = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.050 L`\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion is:\n    `[CH3COO⁻] = moles / V_total = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M`\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze water:\n    `CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻`\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb:\n    `Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰`\n*   Set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    `Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)`\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`.\n    `5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02`\n    `x² ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹`\n    `x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M`\n*   Now calculate pOH and then pH:\n    `pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) = 5.48`\n    `pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52`\n    So, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nLet's perform the calculations with a higher precision using a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05 # M\ninitial_vol_acid = 0.020 # L\ndilution_vol = 0.020 # L\nconc_naoh = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration ---\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# The pH at 25% titration is in the buffer region.\n# [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point ---\n\n# Moles of acetic acid\nmoles_acid = initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid\n\n# Volume of NaOH at equivalence point\nvol_naoh_eq = moles_acid / conc_naoh\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = initial_vol_acid + dilution_vol + vol_naoh_eq\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence point\nconc_base = moles_acid / total_vol_eq\n\n# Calculate Kb\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Solve for [OH-] from Kb = x^2 / (conc_base - x)\n# Using quadratic formula: x = (-Kb + sqrt(Kb^2 + 4*Kb*conc_base)) / 2\n# Or approximation: x = sqrt(Kb * conc_base) since Kb is small\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_base)\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\n# Print results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State and Dilution:**\n    *   We start with 20.00 cm³ (or 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   First, we calculate the initial moles of acetic acid:\n        *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.020 L = 0.001 mol CH₃COOH.\n    *   This solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   The new total volume is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ (or 0.040 L).\n    *   The concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is:\n        *   Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **Calculate pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acid remains unreacted.\n    *   This is a buffer region, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        *   pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n    *   First, we need the pKa of acetic acid:\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n    *   The ratio of conjugate base to acid is:\n        *   [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n    *   Now, we plug the values into the equation:\n        *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n        *   pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n        *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n    *   So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n3.  **Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form 0.001 mol of its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   First, we determine the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:\n        *   Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L (or 10.00 cm³).\n    *   Next, we find the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n        *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ (or 0.050 L).\n    *   Now, we calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) in the solution:\n        *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   The acetate ion is a weak base and will react with water (hydrolysis):\n        *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion, which can be calculated from Ka and Kw (the ion product of water, 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C):\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression to find the [OH⁻]:\n        *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n        *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can simplify by assuming that x is much smaller than 0.02 (i.e., 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02).\n        *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n        *   x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n        *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   Now, we can calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n        *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n    *   So, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. These values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
