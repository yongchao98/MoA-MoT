    "1.  **Analyze the core chemical problem:** The goal is to produce a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the reactant. Standard ethylene polymerization creates linear chains (high-density polyethylene, HDPE). To create branches, alpha-olefins (like 1-butene, 1-hexene, or 1-octene) must be incorporated as comonomers. Since the only reactant is ethylene, the added catalyst system must first produce these alpha-olefins from ethylene (a process called oligomerization) and then either that same catalyst or the original catalyst must incorporate them into the growing polymer chain. This overall process is known as tandem catalysis or *in-situ* comonomer generation.\n    *   Reaction 1 (Oligomerization): n C₂H₄ → 1-C₂ₙH₄ₙ (e.g., 3 C₂H₄ → 1-hexene)\n    *   Reaction 2 (Copolymerization): x C₂H₄ + y 1-C₂ₙH₄ₙ → Branched Polyethylene\n\n2.  **Evaluate each statement based on the chemistry of tandem catalysis:**\n\n    *   **A) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.** Noble metals include palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), etc. Palladium-based catalysts (like certain Brookhart catalysts) are known for ethylene polymerization. While a tandem system involving a noble metal could theoretically be designed in a laboratory, they are not the primary catalysts used for this specific industrial application due to high cost and often lower performance compared to other metals. This statement is plausible in a very general sense but is not the most pertinent or specific to the state-of-the-art technology.\n\n    *   **B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.** The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene to form the comonomer (e.g., 1-hexene). The most effective and well-studied catalysts for this transformation, particularly chromium-based systems, are almost universally activated by aluminum-based compounds. These include methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), or other aluminum alkyls like triethylaluminum (TEA). Therefore, the statement that aluminum-based activators \"do not work\" is factually incorrect. They are, in fact, crucial.\n\n    *   **C) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.** This is factually correct. For example, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company operates a commercial process that uses a specialized catalyst system to trimerize ethylene to 1-hexene and subsequently copolymerize the 1-hexene with ethylene in the same reactor. This allows for the production of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) with controlled branching from a single ethylene feedstock. So, the technology is indeed used on an industrial scale.\n\n    *   **D) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.** Group VIa (or Group 6) of the periodic table includes chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W). Chromium-based catalysts are the most famous and efficient systems for the selective oligomerization of ethylene, particularly for trimerization to 1-hexene. These systems, often involving a chromium source, a specialized ligand (like a PNP-pincer ligand), and an activator, are the cornerstone of the technology described. Therefore, this statement is a precise and correct description of the key chemical component required for the process.\n\n3.  **Compare the correct statements (C and D):**\n    Both C and D are factually correct statements. However, the question originates from a scientist's perspective on how to achieve a chemical synthesis (\"He intends to add a second catalyst system...\").\n    *   Statement D describes the *chemical nature* of the catalyst required (\"a group VIa transition metal\"), which is fundamental advice on *how* to set up the experiment.\n    *   Statement C describes the *commercial status* of the technology (\"already implemented on an industrial scale\").\n    *   Both are true, but D is a more direct answer to the implicit question of what kind of catalyst performs the required oligomerization. The use of a Group VIa metal, specifically Chromium, is the key chemical principle that enables this tandem reaction. It is the most specific and fundamentally correct chemical statement regarding the composition of the catalyst system needed.\n\nGiven the context of a scientist seeking to perform a specific reaction, the statement detailing the class of metal used in the catalyst is the most relevant and fundamentally correct piece of information.\n\n<<<D>>>"
