    "The user is asking to interpret a common phrase used by synthetic organic chemists. The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is an idiom used in the context of chemical purification.\n\n1.  **Analyze the context:** The conversation happens between two chemists leaving a synthetic organic chemistry lab. The chemist is unhappy (\"Not well...\") with the result. This suggests a problem with an experiment, likely a purification step. Synthetic chemists spend a great deal of time purifying the compounds they make.\n\n2.  **Consider the primary purification technique:** The most common method for purifying compounds in a synthetic organic chemistry lab is column chromatography. This technique separates compounds based on their differential adsorption to a stationary phase (like silica gel) as a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents) is passed through the column.\n\n3.  **How chromatography works:** Separation in chromatography is based on the physical properties of the compounds. In normal-phase column chromatography (the most common type), the stationary phase (silica gel) is highly polar.\n    *   Polar compounds interact strongly with the polar silica gel and move down the column slowly.\n    *   Non-polar compounds interact weakly with the silica gel and are carried down the column more quickly by the eluting solvent.\n    *   The goal is to have the different compounds in the mixture separate into distinct bands that can be collected as they exit the column.\n\n4.  **Interpret the phrase \"on top of each other\":** This phrase is a visual metaphor derived from how compounds appear on a Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) plate, which is often used to scout conditions for column chromatography. On a TLC plate, separated compounds appear as distinct spots at different heights. If two compounds have very similar properties, their spots will not resolve and will appear as one large spot, or \"on top of each other.\" When this is translated to a column, it means the compounds are eluting at the same time, co-eluting, and not forming separate bands.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the options based on chromatography:**\n    *   **A) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.** Similar boiling points are problematic for separation by *distillation*. While distillation is a purification method, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is overwhelmingly associated with chromatographic separation, not distillation.\n    *   **B) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.** Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is measured by polarimetry. It is not the basis for common separation techniques (except for specialized chiral chromatography, but the general principle still relies on differential interaction, which is related to polarity/shape). Two different compounds having similar optical rotations does not imply they will be difficult to separate.\n    *   **C) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.** This is the core reason for poor separation in column chromatography. If the product and an impurity (e.g., starting material or a byproduct) have very similar polarities, they will interact with the stationary phase in a nearly identical manner. As a result, they will travel down the column at the same rate and will not separate. This perfectly explains why the compounds would be \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   **D) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.** While molecules do interact, this is not the primary reason for a failed chromatographic separation. The separation relies on the *independent* interaction of each compound with the stationary and mobile phases. The phrase \"on top of each other\" refers to the compounds having similar independent behaviors in the chromatography system, not to them being stuck together.\n\n**Conclusion:** The inability to separate compounds using the most common purification technique, column chromatography, is due to the compounds having very similar polarities. This is colloquially described as the compounds being \"on top of each other.\"\n\n<<<C>>>"
