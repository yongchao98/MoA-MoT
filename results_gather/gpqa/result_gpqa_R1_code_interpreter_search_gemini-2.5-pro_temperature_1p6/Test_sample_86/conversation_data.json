    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the given information:**\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents.\n*   **Atom Count:** There are 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to one of the carbons of the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the chemical structure of the compound:**\n*   We have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   A two-carbon group containing a carbonyl (C=O) is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone, with the general structure X-C6H4-COCH3.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone:**\n*   The structure has a methyl group (-CH3) attached to a carbonyl. The protons of this methyl group are unique and not coupled to any other protons. They should appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around 2.0-2.7 ppm.\n*   The structure has a di-substituted benzene ring, which means there are **4 aromatic protons**. The pattern of these protons depends on the relative positions of the two substituents (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*).\n    *   If the substituents are in the *para* (1,4) position, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This results in a simple, characteristic pattern in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm): **two doublets, each integrating to 2H**.\n    *   If the substituents are in the *ortho* or *meta* positions, the 4 aromatic protons are all chemically different, which would lead to a more complex set of signals (multiplets).\n\n**4. Evaluate the given 1H NMR data options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. It shows a signal for 2H at 1.3 ppm, but our methyl group requires a signal for **3H**. The signals at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are outside the typical aromatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. While it has a 3H singlet, there are **no signals in the aromatic region** (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone (which has no proton on the carbonyl carbon). This data does not correspond to a haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option aligns perfectly with our predicted spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is the **3H singlet** for the methyl group of the acetyl functional group (-COCH**3**). The chemical shift of 2.3 ppm is in the expected range.\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** This is the characteristic pattern for the **4 protons** on a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for an aromatic ring substituted with an electron-withdrawing acetyl group and a halogen.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a *para*-haloacetophenone, and the 1H NMR data in option D is the only one that correctly represents this structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
