    "This question requires arranging six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination. The weight fraction is directly related to the mole fraction of the para-isomer formed among all monobrominated products.\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the primary factor determining the isomer distribution. We must classify each substituent and then consider its effect on the ortho/para/meta distribution. A secondary factor, especially for ortho,para-directors, is the steric hindrance of the group, which influences the ortho-to-para product ratio.\n\nLet's analyze each substance:\n\n**Substituent Classification and Directing Effects:**\n\n*   **Group 1: Ortho, Para-directing groups**\n    These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer will be significant.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 group is activating and o,p-directing. It's relatively small, leading to substantial amounts of both ortho and para products.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 group is also activating and o,p-directing. It is larger than the methyl group, so its steric hindrance will block the ortho positions more effectively, resulting in a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl group is a halogen. It is deactivating overall due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect, but it is ortho,para-directing due to its electron-donating resonance effect. Halogens are known to exhibit high para-selectivity.\n\n*   **Group 2: Meta-directing groups**\n    These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The yields of ortho and para isomers will be very low.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 group is a very strong deactivating group and a meta-director. It will produce the smallest amount of para-isomer.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH group is a strong deactivating group and a meta-director.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC2H5 group is a deactivating group and a meta-director.\n\n**Step-by-Step Ordering:**\n\n1.  **Separate Meta from Ortho,Para Directors:**\n    The para-isomer yields for meta-directing groups (2, 4, 6) will be much lower than for o,p-directing groups (1, 3, 5). Therefore, the sequence will start with the meta-directing compounds.\n    (4, 6, 2) < (1, 3, 5)\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directing Compounds (4, 6, 2):**\n    The yield of the para-isomer for these compounds will be inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivator makes the ortho and para positions even less reactive, leading to a smaller fraction of para product.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: C6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2).\n    *   The sequence begins: **4 < 6 < 2 ...**\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho,Para-Directing Compounds (1, 3, 5):**\n    For these compounds, we need to compare their para-selectivity (the p/o ratio). This is determined by steric and electronic factors. Let's use typical literature values for para-isomer percentage in bromination:\n    *   **1) Toluene (-CH3):** The para-isomer typically accounts for about **~67%** of the product.\n    *   **5) Ethylbenzene (-C2H5):** The larger ethyl group provides more steric hindrance to the ortho positions than the methyl group. This increases the proportion of para-substitution. The para yield should be greater than that of toluene. Empirical data places it between 80-90%. Let's denote Para%(5) > Para%(1).\n    *   **3) Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** Halogens show high para-selectivity due to a combination of electronic stabilization of the para-intermediate and steric hindrance. Bromination of chlorobenzene yields about **~88%** of the para-isomer.\n\n    Now, let's establish the order for 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   Comparing toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5): Para%(1) < Para%(5) due to sterics.\n    *   Comparing the alkylbenzenes to chlorobenzene (3): Para%(Toluene, ~67%) < Para%(Chlorobenzene, ~88%). So, 1 < 3.\n    *   Comparing ethylbenzene (5) to chlorobenzene (3): This is the key comparison. Based on the most reliable empirical data, the para-selectivity of chlorobenzene is extremely high. While ethylbenzene's selectivity is higher than toluene's, it is generally considered slightly less than that of chlorobenzene. So, Para%(5) < Para%(3).\n    *   Therefore, the order for the o,p-directors is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n    *   The second part of the sequence is: **... < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n4.  **Combine the sequences:**\n    Combining the two ordered groups gives the final sequence:\n    **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal check of the ordered substances:\nC6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5 < C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl\n\n<<<B>>>"
