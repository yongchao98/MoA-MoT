    "The user wants me to identify the set of assumptions that together constitute the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Core Concept: The Impulse Approximation**\n\nThe name itself gives a clue. \"Impulse\" refers to a large force applied over a very short time (like hitting a baseball with a bat). The impulse approximation in nuclear physics posits that when a high-energy projectile (like an electron or neutrino) interacts with a nucleon inside a nucleus, the interaction happens so quickly that:\n*   The nucleon that gets \"hit\" doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors.\n*   The binding forces holding the nucleon in the nucleus are negligible compared to the energy of the interaction.\n\nEssentially, for that brief moment of interaction, the nucleon behaves as if it were a free, isolated particle.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Assumption**\n\nLet's evaluate how each of the four statements relates to this core concept.\n\n*   **Assumption 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    *   This assumption is fundamental. It says the probe interacts with *one nucleon at a time*. This excludes more complex scenarios where the probe interacts with a pair of nucleons simultaneously (e.g., via meson-exchange currents). If the interaction fundamentally involves multiple nucleons, you cannot approximate the process by looking at a single \"free\" nucleon. This assumption is necessary.\n\n*   **Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    *   This deals with the \"before\" and \"after\" of the main interaction. If the nucleus is *not* transparent, the incoming projectile might scatter off other nucleons before hitting the target nucleon, or the struck nucleon might scatter off its neighbors on its way out of the nucleus (these are called initial-state and final-state interactions). To treat the event as a simple, clean interaction with a free particle, we must assume these additional interactions don't happen. This \"transparency\" assumption is a key part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation). This assumption is necessary.\n\n*   **Assumption 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    *   This is a statement about the *internal structure of the nucleon itself*, not its behavior within the nuclear medium. The impulse approximation is about how the *nucleon as a whole* behaves. You can apply the impulse approximation whether you model the nucleon using a non-relativistic quark model, a relativistic bag model, or simply using experimentally measured form factors. In fact, the high-energy interactions where the impulse approximation is most valid often involve relativistic effects. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\n*   **Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    *   This is the absolute heart of the \"impulse\" concept. A \"free\" nucleon, by definition, experiences no binding forces. This assumption states that the energy exchanged in the interaction is so much larger than the nucleon's binding energy (~8 MeV) that the binding can be ignored during the brief moment of collision. This is a defining feature of the approximation. This assumption is necessary.\n\n**3. Synthesize the Results**\n\nTo make the \"impulse approximation\" (that nucleons in a nucleus behave like free nucleons), we need to jointly assume:\n1.  The interaction targets only one nucleon. (Assumption 1)\n2.  The surrounding nucleons don't interfere with the process. (Assumption 2)\n3.  The binding force on the target nucleon is negligible during the interaction. (Assumption 4)\n\nThe assumptions that correctly combine to define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n**4. Match with Options**\n*   A) 2,3,4 - Incorrect, includes 3.\n*   B) 1,2,3 - Incorrect, includes 3.\n*   C) 1,2,4 - Correct.\n*   D) 1,3,4 - Incorrect, includes 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
