    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the operator and the vector space.**\n    The problem provides the components of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ in a 2-dimensional Hilbert space (as indicated by the 2x2 matrices). These components are proportional to the Pauli matrices, which are standard for describing spin-1/2 particles like muons.\n    The components are:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, usually denoted by $\\vec{S}$.\n\n2.  **Define the operator for the specified direction.**\n    We need the operator for the component of spin along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. An arbitrary unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the positive z-axis.\n    The Cartesian components of this unit vector are:\n    $n_x = \\sin\\theta$\n    $n_y = 0$\n    $n_z = \\cos\\theta$\n    So, $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n    The operator corresponding to the spin component along $\\vec{n}$ is $P_n = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$.\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{n}$ and $\\vec{P}$:\n    $P_n = (\\sin\\theta) P_x + (0) P_y + (\\cos\\theta) P_z$\n    $P_n = \\sin\\theta \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) + \\cos\\theta \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right)$\n    We can factor out the constant $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n3.  **Set up and solve the eigenvalue equation.**\n    We are looking for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    Let the eigenvector be represented by a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    We can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    This gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n    $b\\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    Now, we use trigonometric half-angle identities to simplify this expression:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    This means that $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector has the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can choose $a$ to make the vector look simpler. If we set $a = C \\cos(\\theta/2)$ (where C is a normalization constant), then $b = C \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = C \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    So, the unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n4.  **Normalize the eigenvector.**\n    The norm of a state vector must be 1, i.e., $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$. For a column vector, this means the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components is 1.\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |C|^2 \\left( (\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 \\right) = 1$\n    Using the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2 x + \\sin^2 x = 1$:\n    $|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$.\n    By convention, we choose the normalization constant to be a positive real number, so $C=1$.\n\n    The normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    A) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$: Incorrect. Eigenvectors are state vectors and their components are dimensionless. The presence of $\\hbar$ makes this physically incorrect.\n    B) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$: This perfectly matches our derived result.\n    C) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$: Incorrect for the same reason as A, and also has incorrect coefficients.\n    D) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$: Incorrect. The dependence is on $\\theta$, not $\\theta/2$. The phase factor $e^{i\\phi}$ would appear if the direction vector $\\vec{n}$ had a y-component (i.e., was not in the x-z plane).\n\nThus, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
