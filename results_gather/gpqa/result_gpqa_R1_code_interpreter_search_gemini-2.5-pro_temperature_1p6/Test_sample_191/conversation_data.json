    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have a neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor with a cavity inside. A point charge `+q` is placed within this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the entire conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply Properties of Conductors:** A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside its bulk material must be zero.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:**\n    *   Consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this surface is proportional to the net charge enclosed: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    *   Since the electric field `E` is zero everywhere inside the conductor's material, the flux through our chosen Gaussian surface must be zero.\n    *   This implies that the net charge enclosed ($Q_{enc}$) by the Gaussian surface must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge `+q` inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    *   Therefore, $q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$. A charge of `-q` is induced on the wall of the cavity.\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0).\n    *   A charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface from the free electrons within the conductor.\n    *   To maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear somewhere else on the conductor. This charge will reside on the outer surface of the conductor ($q_{outer} = +q$).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The electric field at the external point P is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges in the system:\n        1.  The original point charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n        2.  The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n        3.  The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n    *   Let's consider the combined effect of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the charge `-q` on the inner wall. As established in step 3, this combination creates a zero electric field everywhere within the conductor material. A key result of electrostatics (a property often called electrostatic shielding or the Faraday cage effect) is that the field produced by charges inside a conducting shell and the induced charges on its inner surface is zero *everywhere outside that inner surface*.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is produced *only* by the charge residing on the outer surface of the conductor. The charges inside the cavity (`+q` and `-q`) have no net effect on the field outside.\n\n6.  **Field from the Outer Surface Charge:**\n    *   We have a charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   Since the conductor is spherical and there are no other external charges, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface to be in equilibrium.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In this problem, the total charge on the outer shell is `+q`. The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance `L` from the point P.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The various details about the cavity's position and size (`r`, `s`, `l`, `Î¸`) are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and its spherical geometry.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. This ignores the conductor.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct. This matches our derivation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
