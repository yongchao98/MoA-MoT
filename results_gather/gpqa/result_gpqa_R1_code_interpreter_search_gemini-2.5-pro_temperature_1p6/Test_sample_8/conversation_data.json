    "To determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry, we must first understand the requirements for this point group. A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses:\n1.  A principal C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 360°/3 = 120° leaves the molecule unchanged).\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n3.  It must not have any other symmetry elements that would place it in a higher symmetry group (like D3h, which additionally has three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each molecule provided:\n\n**B) Triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. To minimize steric repulsion, the three groups arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion around the boron atom.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**:\n    *   There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the approximate plane formed by the B and the three O atoms. A 120° rotation around this axis permutes the three isopropoxy groups.\n    *   However, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh). The isopropoxy group, -OCH(CH3)2, is not planar and does not have a plane of symmetry that would coincide with the BO3 plane. Reflecting an isopropyl group through this plane does not result in an identical structure.\n*   **Conclusion**: The point group of triisopropyl borate is C3, not C3h.\n\n**C) Quinuclidine (C7H13N)**\n*   **Structure**: This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the opposite bridgehead.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**:\n    *   It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon (C4). Rotation by 120° permutes the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   It does *not* have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). A plane perpendicular to the C3 axis would lie between the N and CH bridgeheads. Reflection through this plane would map the nitrogen atom onto the position of the carbon atom, which are different atoms.\n    *   It does have three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges.\n*   **Conclusion**: The point group of quinuclidine is C3v, not C3h.\n\n**A) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule is the trianhydride of mellitic acid (benzene-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexacarboxylic acid). It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three five-membered anhydride rings. The entire molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**:\n    *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule superimposable on itself.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself is a mirror plane. Since this plane is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis, it is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. An axis passing through the center and bisecting opposite bonds of the benzene ring is not a symmetry element because the anhydride groups (-C(=O)-O-C(=O)-) are not symmetric upon 180° rotation around such an axis.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane, and the absence of perpendicular C2 axes, uniquely defines the C3h point group.\n*   **Conclusion**: This molecule belongs to the C3h point group.\n\n**D) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule has a central triphenylene core (four fused benzene rings) fused with three anhydride groups. Like molecule A, it is also planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**:\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   It has a σh plane, which is the molecular plane itself.\n    *   Unlike molecule A, it *also* possesses three C2 axes lying in the molecular plane (perpendicular to the C3 axis). Each C2 axis passes through the center of the molecule and the center of an outer anhydride ring.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of the C3 axis, σh plane, and three perpendicular C2 axes places this molecule in the D3h point group, which has higher symmetry than C3h.\n\nTherefore, the only molecule among the choices whose point group is C3h is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.\n\n<<<A>>>"
