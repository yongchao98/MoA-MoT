    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR**: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in decoding the complex splitting patterns described in the 1H NMR data. We need to find a molecule that contains two specific types of protons:\n*   One proton signal that is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This means the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (n=1, gives a doublet), a set of two protons (n=2, gives a triplet), and a set of three protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n*   A *different* proton signal that is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This means this second proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (n=1, gives a doublet), a set of two protons (n=2, gives a triplet), and another, different set of two protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n\nThe information that there are no vinyl hydrogens confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four structures.\n\n**3. Analysis of Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's draw each structure and predict the splitting patterns for the protons on the main chain, as these are the most likely to be highly complex. We will number the carbons starting from the carboxylic acid group (C1).\n\n*   **A) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3(5)-CH(Me)(4)-CH(Me)(3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), CH2 at C2 (2H, triplet), and the CH3 on C3 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dqt**.\n    *   **H at C4**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), CH3 at C5 (3H, quartet), and the CH3 on C4 (3H, quartet). This gives a `dqq`.\n    *   This molecule has a `dqt` but lacks a `dtt`. Thus, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3(5)-CH(Et)(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: This proton is coupled to the H at C4 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH2 protons at C2 (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH2 protons of the ethyl group attached to C3 (2H, gives another triplet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   **H at C4**: This proton is coupled to the H at C3 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH2 protons of the ethyl group attached to C4 (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH3 protons at C5 (3H, gives a quartet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   This molecule contains both a `dtt` signal (from H at C3) and a `dtq` signal (from H at C4). This perfectly matches the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3(5)-CH2(4)-CH(Me)(3)-CH(Me)(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), CH2 at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH3 on C3 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dqt**.\n    *   There is no proton in this molecule that would give a `dtt` signal. Thus, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3(5)-CH2(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH(Et)(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), CH2 at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH2 of the ethyl group at C3 (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt**.\n    *   There is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to a single proton, a group of two protons, and a group of three protons. Therefore, it lacks a `dqt` signal. Thus, D is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option B, **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, has protons that would generate both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
