    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon. Let its formula be CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen can be calculated as: `%H = (mass of H / total mass) * 100`. Using integer atomic masses for simplicity (H=1, C=12), we get: `%H = (m * 1) / (n * 12 + m * 1) * 100`.\n    *   So, `14.28 ≈ m / (12n + m) * 100`.\n    *   `0.1428 ≈ m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   This value, 14.28%, is very close to 1/7 (1/7 ≈ 0.142857 or 14.2857%). This suggests that the ratio of hydrogen mass to total mass is 1:7.\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    *   `7m = 12n + m`\n    *   `6m = 12n`\n    *   `m = 2n`.\n    *   So, the molecular formula of Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon that does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is saturated. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane. Saturated non-cyclic alkanes have the formula CnH2n+2.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, and it does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (alkanes, cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z, which we've identified as a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* Z. Let the other component of Y be D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Z (a cycloalkane) gives Z (no reaction).\n    *   Hydrogenation of D must also give Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water (ruling out simple alkenes/alkynes), and it hydrogenates to a cycloalkane, D must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   The most common example of such a pair is cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions yields cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). It is a widely used solvent, fitting the description.\n    *   This implies n=6. Z = C6H12 and the other component D = C6H6 (Benzene).\n    *   So, Mixture Y = an equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6). This mixture does not decolorize bromine water, consistent with the problem statement.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives *only* Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). This means that both A and B must have the same C6 carbon skeleton, which is a six-membered ring. So, A and B are C6Hx and C6Hy.\n    *   The reaction is the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y, described as a disproportionation. Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures of two components, the reaction is most likely a 1:1 reaction between the components of X to form the components of Y.\n    *   Reaction: `A + B → C + D`\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds: `C6Hx + C6Hy → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   By the principle of conservation of atoms, the number of each type of atom must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation.\n    *   For hydrogen atoms: `(Number of H in A) + (Number of H in B) = (Number of H in Cyclohexane) + (Number of H in Benzene)`.\n    *   `x + y = 12 + 6`\n    *   `x + y = 18`\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B, which is `x + y`.\n\n5.  **Final Check of Consistency**\n    *   We need to ensure there exist two molecules A and B that fit the description.\n    *   A = C6Hx, B = C6Hy, where x+y=18.\n    *   Both must be unsaturated C6-ring compounds and must not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   Let's consider possible compounds:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). It has one double bond (unsaturated) and is not conjugated. So, we can have x=10.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). It has two double bonds (unsaturated) which are not conjugated. So, we can have y=8.\n    *   Check the sum: `10 + 8 = 18`. This matches our calculation.\n    *   The reaction would be: Cyclohexene (C6H10) + Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6). This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where the diene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This is a plausible disproportionation reaction.\n    *   (Note: Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is also C6H8, but it has conjugated bonds and is excluded by the problem statement).\n    *   Therefore, the reasoning is fully consistent.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
