    "## Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The problem asks for the specific pathway and the associated probability for a hydrogen atom to decay from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> (denoted as |3,0,0>) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0> (denoted as |1,0,0>) through a sequence of two electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole Selection Rules:** For an atom to transition from one state to another by emitting a single photon (an electric dipole transition), the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n    *   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly one.\n    *   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by zero or one.\n    *   **Δn is unrestricted**: The principal quantum number can change by any integer value, but for a decay (emission) process, it must decrease (Δn < 0).\n\n3.  **Trace the Two-Step Transition Path:** The decay happens in two steps, so we need an intermediate state, let's call it |n', l', m'>.\n\n    *   **Step 1: Decay from |3,0,0> to |n',l',m'>**\n        *   Initial State: |3,0,0> (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n        *   Applying Δl = ±1: Since l=0 initially, the intermediate state must have l' = 1 (l' cannot be -1).\n        *   Applying Δn < 0: The principal quantum number n' must be less than 3. The most probable transitions are those to the closest available energy levels, so we expect the intermediate state to have n'=2.\n        *   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: Starting from m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   Combining these, the possible intermediate states are:\n            *   |2,1,0>\n            *   |2,1,1>\n            *   |2,1,-1>\n\n    *   **Step 2: Decay from |n',l',m'> to |1,0,0>**\n        *   Final State: |1,0,0> (n=1, l=0, m=0).\n        *   Let's check if a transition from our possible intermediate states |2,1,m'> to the final state is allowed.\n        *   Initial state for this step is |2,1,m'> (n=2, l=1).\n        *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = 0 - 1 = -1. This is an allowed transition (Δl = -1).\n        *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0 - m'. This must be 0, ±1. Since m' can be 0, +1, or -1, the possible values for Δm are 0, -1, and +1, respectively. All are allowed.\n        *   Therefore, all three intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0>.\n\n    *   **Possible Complete Routes:**\n        1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n        2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n        3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n        All the routes listed in the options are valid based on selection rules. Now we need to determine the probability.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** The \"probability\" of a specific decay route refers to its branching ratio. The total probability of the cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 1 (|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>):**\n        *   The initial state |3,0,0> has l=0 and is therefore spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space.\n        *   The atom decays into one of the three states of the 2p subshell: |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>.\n        *   Because the initial state is symmetric and space is isotropic (no external fields), there is no reason for the atom to prefer decaying into one m' state over the others. Therefore, the transition rates to each of these three states must be equal.\n        *   Let the rate for |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'> be Γ_m'. Then Γ_{-1} = Γ_{0} = Γ_{+1}.\n        *   The total decay rate from |3,0,0> to the 2p subshell is Γ_total = Γ_{-1} + Γ_{0} + Γ_{+1} = 3Γ_{0}.\n        *   The branching ratio (probability) for the atom to decay into a specific state, say |2,1,0>, is the rate for that specific channel divided by the total rate:\n            P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Γ_{0} / Γ_total = Γ_{0} / (3Γ_{0}) = 1/3.\n        *   Similarly, the probability of transitioning to |2,1,1> is 1/3, and to |2,1,-1> is also 1/3.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2 (|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>):**\n        *   Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say |2,1,0>, it must decay further.\n        *   According to the selection rules, the 2p state (|n=2,l=1>) can only decay via a dipole transition to the 1s state (|n=1,l=0>). The transition 2p → 2s is forbidden because Δl = 0.\n        *   Since the decay to the 1s state is the only allowed dipole transition downwards, it occurs with a probability of 1 (or 100%), assuming we wait long enough for the decay to happen.\n        *   So, P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>) = 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for the Cascade:** The probability of the entire sequence is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n        *   For the route in option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n        *   Total Probability = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The transition route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is a valid path, and its probability is 1/3. Comparing this with the given options:\n\n    *   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3. This matches our result.\n    *   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n    *   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
