    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y.**\n    The problem states that A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) in A2 is 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFx.\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ωF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    We are given ωF = 0.3196. Let's use M(F) ≈ 19 g/mol.\n    0.3196 = (x * 19) / (M(Y) + x * 19)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19 * x = 19 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = (19 - 6.0724) * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer x that satisfy this relationship. The element Y forms five binary fluorides, and some are strong enough to oxidize xenon. This points to elements capable of high oxidation states, like actinides, noble gases, or halogens.\n\n    Let's test integer values for x:\n    *   x=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca)\n    *   x=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br)\n    *   x=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Sb)\n    *   x=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dy)\n    *   x=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Hg, Au)\n    *   x=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Pu, Am)\n\n    Let's calculate the theoretical ωF for the most likely candidates:\n    *   For Y=Sb (M=121.76) and x=3 (A2=SbF3):\n        ωF(SbF3) = (3 * 18.998) / (121.76 + 3 * 18.998) = 56.994 / 178.754 = 0.3188 = 31.89%. This is a very close match to 31.96%.\n    *   For Y=Pu (M=244) and x=6 (A2=PuF6):\n        ωF(PuF6) = (6 * 18.998) / (244 + 6 * 18.998) = 113.988 / 357.988 = 0.3184 = 31.84%. This is also a very close match.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Candidates for Y.**\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** While the mass percent for SbF3 is an excellent fit, other clues contradict this choice. The main binary fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5, not five. Also, if A2=SbF3, then A1, which decomposes into A2+F2, would be SbF5. SbF5 is a colorless liquid, but A1 is described as \"bright-red\". The decomposition of SbF5 also requires high temperatures, not 293 K (20 °C). Thus, Y is unlikely to be Sb.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu):** Let's assume Y=Pu and A2=PuF6.\n        *   \"Five binary compounds\": PuF3, PuF4, PuF6, and the recently synthesized PuF5 are known. The \"five\" might refer to an older or slightly inaccurate source, but it's more plausible than for Sb.\n        *   \"A1 is bright-red and decomposes at 293 K into A2(PuF6) and F2\": This would imply A1 is a higher, unstable fluoride like PuF8. While hypothetical, such a compound would be a very strong oxidant, likely colored, and unstable. PuF6 itself is reddish-brown, close to the description. This clue is plausible in the context of a chemistry puzzle.\n        *   \"A1 and A3 oxidize xenon\": PuF6 is a powerful oxidant known to react with xenon (PuF6 + Xe -> XeF2 + PuF4). This fits perfectly. A hypothetical PuF8 would be even stronger.\n        *   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y\": PuF6 can be obtained by fluorination of Pu.\n\n    The Plutonium hypothesis seems the most consistent, despite minor ambiguities. We proceed with Y = Pu.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    The core of the problem lies in these clues:\n    *   A4 is a substance that forms a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\".\n    *   Y (Pu) reacts with A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce A5. (Pu + A4 -> A5)\n    *   A5 decomposes in water to form two substances.\n\n    The hydrolysis clue is very restrictive. It strongly suggests that A5 is a simple halide that hydrolyzes into an oxide/oxyhalide and a hydrohalic acid. For example:\n    *   PuF4 + 2H2O -> PuO2 + 4HF (two products)\n    *   PuF6 + 2H2O -> PuO2F2 + 4HF (two products)\n\n    So, A5 is likely PuF4 or PuF6. The reaction must be Pu + A4 -> PuF4 (or PuF6) with a 1:1 stoichiometry of reactants. This implies A4 is a fluoride of another element (let's call it Z, so A4=ZFn) that transfers its fluorine atoms to Pu.\n\n    Let's test potential fluorinating agents (A4) from the multiple-choice options, checking their reactions and molecular weights (MW). A4 must be colorless.\n\n    *   From the options, we examine fluorides with MW in the given ranges:\n        *   C) 160-180: XeF2 (MW=169.3), BrF5 (MW=174.9, pale yellow)\n        *   D) 220-240: IF5 (MW=221.9), TeF6 (MW=241.6), close to XeF6 (MW=245.3)\n\n    *   Let's analyze the most promising reactions:\n        *   If A4 = XeF4 (MW=207.3, not in any range): Pu + XeF4 -> PuF4 + Xe. This is a clean 1:1 reaction producing A5=PuF4, which hydrolyzes to two products. The chemistry works, but the MW doesn't match the options.\n        *   If A4 = XeF6 (MW=245.3, near range D): Pu + XeF6 -> PuF6 + Xe. This is a clean 1:1 reaction. XeF6 is a stronger oxidant than XeF4, so producing PuF6 (A5) is very plausible. A5=PuF6 hydrolyzes to two products. The MW is just outside range D, but the chemistry is very sound and thematically consistent with the problem's mentions of xenon.\n        *   If A4 = TeF6 (MW=241.6, in range D): Pu + TeF6 -> PuF6 + Te. Tellurium hexafluoride is a strong oxidant, so this reaction to form A5=PuF6 is plausible. A5=PuF6 hydrolyzes correctly. A4 is colorless. The molecular weight fits perfectly within range D.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    The hypothesis that A4 is TeF6 provides the most consistent explanation.\n    *   Y = Pu, A2 = PuF6.\n    *   A4 = TeF6, which is colorless.\n    *   The reaction Pu + TeF6 -> PuF6 + Te is 1:1 in reactants and produces A5 = PuF6.\n    *   A5 = PuF6 decomposes in water to two substances: PuO2F2 and HF.\n    *   The molecular weight of TeF6 is M(Te) + 6*M(F) ≈ 127.6 + 6*19 = 241.6 g/mol.\n    *   This molecular weight falls into the range 220-240.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<D>>>"
