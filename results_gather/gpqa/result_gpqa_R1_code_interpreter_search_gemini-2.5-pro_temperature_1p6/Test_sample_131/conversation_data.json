    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Information Provided**\n\n1.  **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two aromatic compounds.\n2.  **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds have the formula C10H14.\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals, both singlets, at ~6.7 ppm with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Three signals, all singlets, at ~2.2 ppm with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Structure and Expected ¹H NMR Spectra of Each Option**\n\nAll four options (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene) have the molecular formula C10H14. Let's predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Less symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons (at C4 and C6). Their chemical environments are different. H4 is between two methyl groups, while H6 is next to a methyl group and another proton. They are not equivalent and have no adjacent protons, so they will produce **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically non-equivalent. However, in practice, due to very similar chemical environments, the methyl groups at C1 and C3 often show accidental equivalence. Therefore, the spectrum typically shows **three singlets** with integrals of **6H** (for Me-1 and Me-3), **3H** (for Me-2), and **3H** (for Me-5). The ratio is 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry passing between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent by symmetry. However, they are adjacent to each other. They will couple and split each other's signals, producing a pattern of **two doublets** (an AX system), not singlets.\n    *   **This compound can be eliminated** because the problem specifies the aromatic signals are singlets.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons on the ethyl groups will show splitting. The two equivalent -CH₂- groups (4H total) will be split by the adjacent -CH₃ groups into a **quartet**. The two equivalent -CH₃ groups (6H total) will be split by the adjacent -CH₂- groups into a **triplet**.\n    *   **This compound can be eliminated** because the problem states the aliphatic signals are all singlets.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Options Based on Eliminations**\n\n*   Options C and D include 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which is ruled out because its aromatic signals would not be singlets.\n*   Option B includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is ruled out because its aliphatic signals would be a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n\nThis leaves only **Option A** as the possible answer: a mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n### **Step 4: Verify that a 1:1 Mixture of Compounds in Option A Matches the Spectrum**\n\nLet's check if a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)** can produce the observed spectrum. We need to sum the signals from both compounds and account for possible overlaps (accidental equivalence).\n\n**Total Protons in a 1:1 Mixture:**\n*   Aromatic: 2H (from Durene) + 2H (from Isodurene) = 4H\n*   Aliphatic: 12H (from Durene) + 12H (from Isodurene) = 24H\n\n**Observed Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **Aromatic:** Two signals in a 1:1 ratio. Since the total is 4H, the two signals must integrate to **2H** and **2H**.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. Since the total is 24H, the integrals are (2/4)*24H = **12H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**, and (1/4)*24H = **6H**.\n\n**Matching Individual Signals to Observed Mixture Signals:**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene provides one singlet for **2H**. This can be one of the two observed signals.\n    *   Isodurene provides two singlets, each for 1H. If these two signals have a very similar chemical shift (which is common), they can overlap to form a single peak that integrates to 1H + 1H = **2H**.\n    *   Result: Two signals, each integrating to 2H. This matches the observed 1:1 ratio. **This is a match.**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Durene provides one singlet for **12H**. This can be the \"2\" part of the 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   Isodurene provides three singlets with integrals of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   Let's assume the 6H signal from Isodurene is one of the \"1\" parts of the 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   This leaves two 3H singlets from Isodurene. If these two signals overlap (accidental equivalence), they will form a single peak integrating to 3H + 3H = **6H**. This can be the other \"1\" part of the ratio.\n    *   Result: Three signals with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This corresponds to a 2:1:1 ratio. **This is a match.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nA 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene perfectly explains the described ¹H NMR spectrum, assuming plausible overlaps of signals with similar chemical shifts.\n\n<<<A>>>"
