    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics**: The problem involves the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. This method relies on the Doppler effect. An orbiting planet causes its host star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble induces a periodic shift in the wavelength of light from the star as it moves towards and away from us.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity**: The observed periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$). The formula is:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{K}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    This means that the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum observed wavelength shifts.\n    Given:\n    $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom (mÅ)\n    $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom (mÅ)\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n3.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (P)**: We need to find the relationship between the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) and the planet's orbital period ($P$). The formula for $K$ for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    (where we use the approximation $M_{star} + m_p \\approx M_{star}$, which is valid here as a star is much more massive than a Neptune-sized planet).\n    In this formula:\n    -   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    -   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    -   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    -   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Conditions**: The problem states that:\n    -   The star masses are the same ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n    -   The planet masses are similar ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n    -   The problem is solvable with a unique answer, which implies we can assume other factors, like the orbital inclination $i$, are the same for both systems ($i_1 \\approx i_2$).\n\n    Under these conditions, most terms in the formula for $K$ are constant for both systems: $(2\\pi G)^{1/3}$, $m_p \\sin i$, and $M_{star}^{2/3}$.\n    This leaves us with the proportionality:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**: We can write the proportionality as a ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(P_2)^{-1/3}}{(P_1)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We are looking for the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n    Now, substitute the known ratio of $K_1/K_2$:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value**:\n    To get the numerical answer, we compute the value of $(5/7)^3$.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods (P2/P1)\n# P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3\nresult = (5/7)**3\nprint(result)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.36443148688046645\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.364. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Reasoning Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics**: The problem utilizes the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. The key principle is that an orbiting planet gravitationally tugs on its host star, causing the star to move in a small orbit around the system's common center of mass. This motion creates a Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines, which we observe as a periodic change in wavelength.\n\n2.  **Relate Observables to Physical Quantities**:\n    *   The observed quantity is the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$).\n    *   This shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), which is the maximum speed of the star along our line of sight. The relationship is given by the Doppler formula: $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{K}{c}$, where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   From this, we can establish a ratio:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1}$\n    *   Given $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom and $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom, we have:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n3.  **Find the Relationship between Radial Velocity (K) and Orbital Period (P)**:\n    *   The formula for the stellar radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit (and assuming the planet's mass $m_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$) is:\n        $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    *   Here, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n4.  **Simplify Based on Problem's Conditions**:\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n    *   Since the problem expects a definite answer, we must assume that other unknown factors are the same for both systems. This is a common practice in physics problems of this type. Therefore, we assume the orbital inclination is the same ($ \\sin i_1 \\approx \\sin i_2 $).\n    *   With these assumptions, most terms in the equation for $K$ are constant for both systems: $m_p$, $M_{star}$, $\\sin i$, and the physical constants $G$ and $2\\pi$.\n    *   This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n        $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Form a Ratio and Solve for the Period Ratio**:\n    *   From the proportionality $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write a ratio:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(P_2)^{-1/3}}{(P_1)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n    *   We want to find the ratio of the orbital periods, $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. We need to rearrange the equation to solve for it.\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^{3}$\n    *   We know that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, which means $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    *   Now, substitute this value into our equation:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value**:\n    *   The final step is to compute the numerical value of $(5/7)^3$.\n    *   Using the provided code output: $(5/7)^3 \\approx 0.3644$.\n\n7.  **Match with Options**:\n    *   The calculated value, 0.3644, is closest to option B, which is ~0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>"
