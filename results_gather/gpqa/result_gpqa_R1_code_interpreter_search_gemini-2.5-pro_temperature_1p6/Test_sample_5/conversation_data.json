    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n    The given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\n    To solve this problem, it is best to convert the potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    *   x = r * cos(θ)\n    *   y = r * sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    From these relationships, we can see that x^2 = (r * cos(θ))^2 = r^2 * cos^2(θ).\n\n    Now substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * x^2\n    Combine the terms with x^2 and y^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n2.  **Separate the Hamiltonian**\n    The potential V(x, y) is a sum of two independent functions, one that depends only on x and one that depends only on y:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where:\n    *   V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n    *   V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n    This means the two-dimensional Schrödinger equation is separable. The Hamiltonian H can be written as the sum of two independent one-dimensional Hamiltonians, H_x and H_y:\n    H = H_x + H_y\n    H_x = (p_x^2 / 2m) + V_x(x)\n    H_y = (p_y^2 / 2m) + V_y(y)\n\n    The total energy E of the system will be the sum of the energy eigenvalues of the two independent systems:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n\n3.  **Solve the 1D Harmonic Oscillator Problems**\n    Both V_x(x) and V_y(y) are potentials for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). The standard form of the QHO potential is V(q) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * q^2, and its energy eigenvalues are E_n = (n + 1/2) * ℏ * ω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n    **For the x-direction:**\n    V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2. We set this equal to the standard form:\n    1/2 * m * ω_x^2 * x^2 = 2 * k * x^2\n    ω_x^2 = 4k / m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k / m))\n\n    **For the y-direction:**\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2. We set this equal to the standard form:\n    1/2 * m * ω_y^2 * y^2 = 1/2 * k * y^2\n    ω_y^2 = k / m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k / m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ * ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n4.  **Find the Total Energy Spectrum**\n    The total energy E is the sum of E_{n_x} and E_{n_y}:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k / m)) + (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    Let's factor out the common term ℏ * sqrt(k / m):\n    E = [ 2 * (n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = ( 2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2 ) * ℏ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = ( 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) * ℏ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    This expression represents the energy spectrum of the particle. Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Our derived energy spectrum matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
