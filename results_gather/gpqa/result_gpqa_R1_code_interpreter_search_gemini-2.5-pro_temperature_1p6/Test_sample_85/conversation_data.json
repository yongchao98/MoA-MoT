    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product for both reactions, after workup, is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name:\n*   **-2-one**: Indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2.\n*   **-2H-pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom. The \"2H\" specifies the position of the necessary saturated carbon in the parent pyran ring, and combined with \"tetrahydro\", it confirms a saturated ring.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: All carbons in the ring are sp3 hybridized (saturated), except for the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the carbon at position 4.\n*   **lactone**: The suffix \"-one\" with a heteroatom in the ring indicates a lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The numbering for lactones starts with the heteroatom (Oxygen) as position 1, and the adjacent carbonyl carbon as position 2.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups (H, ethyl group, C3, and C5). The product names specify either the (R) or (S) configuration at this center.\n\n**Structure of the product:**\n```\n      O        // Lactone ring O is position 1\n     / \\\n  (C6)--(C2)=O   // Carbonyl C is position 2\n   |     |\n (C5)---(C3)\n     \\   /\n      (C4)-CH2CH3 // Chiral center with an ethyl group\n```\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provide starting materials of the form \"(R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's determine its structure:\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A 5-carbon carboxylic acid. The COOH group is at C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This is a way to describe an isobutyl ester at the end of the chain. C5 has a carbonyl group (=O) and is also bonded to an isobutoxy group (-O-iBu).\n*   **Chiral Center**: The carbon at C3, bearing the ethyl group, is the chiral center.\n\n**Structure of the starting material:**\n```\n        Et\n        |\nHOOC - CH2 - CH - CH2 - C(=O) - O-iBu\n  1      2    3    4       5\n```\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl-containing functional groups: a carboxylic acid (at C1) and an isobutyl ester (at C5).\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3.\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is a milder reducing agent than LiAlH4.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\nThe chiral center at C3 is not directly involved in the reduction of the functional groups at C1 or C5. Therefore, its stereochemistry will be retained throughout both reaction sequences.\n\n**Reaction A: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reduction Step**: LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged.\n    ```\n            Et\n            |\n    HOOC - CH2 - CH - CH2 - C(=O) - O-iBu  --LiBH4-->  HOOC - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH2OH\n      A        Et                                      Intermediate\n             |\n    ```\n2.  **Lactonization Step**: The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The newly formed hydroxyl group (-OH at C5) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid (at C1) to form a stable six-membered ring, eliminating a molecule of water.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: Since the C3 chiral center's configuration is retained, the C4 chiral center of the resulting lactone will have the same configuration as the C3 of the starting material.\n    *   (R)-starting material → (R)-lactone\n    *   (S)-starting material → (S)-lactone\n4.  **Conclusion for A**: The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Therefore, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B: B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reduction Step**: BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    ```\n            Et\n            |\n    HOOC - CH2 - CH - CH2 - C(=O) - O-iBu  --BH3-->  HOCH2 - CH2 - CH - CH2 - C(=O) - O-iBu\n      B        Et                                   Intermediate\n             |\n    ```\n2.  **Lactonization Step**: The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group (-OH at the former C1 position) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester (at C5) to form the same six-membered lactone ring, eliminating a molecule of isobutanol (HO-iBu).\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: Again, the configuration of the C3 chiral center is retained. The C4 chiral center of the lactone product will have the same configuration as the C3 of the starting material.\n    *   (R)-starting material → (R)-lactone\n    *   (S)-starting material → (S)-lactone\n4.  **Conclusion for B**: The product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Therefore, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
