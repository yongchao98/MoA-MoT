    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Normalization of the State Vector |α⟩**\n\nThe given state is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. Let's write it as:\n|α⟩ = C * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]\n\nTo be a valid quantum state, the state vector must be normalized, meaning the inner product ⟨α|α⟩ must equal 1. The bra ⟨α| is the conjugate transpose of the ket |α⟩:\n⟨α| = C* * [(1-i)⟨up| + (2+i)⟨down|]\n\nNow, we calculate the inner product, remembering that ⟨up|up⟩ = 1, ⟨down|down⟩ = 1, and ⟨up|down⟩ = ⟨down|up⟩ = 0:\n⟨α|α⟩ = |C|² * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)]\n⟨α|α⟩ = |C|² * [(1² - i²) + (2² - i²)]\n⟨α|α⟩ = |C|² * [(1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1))]\n⟨α|α⟩ = |C|² * [2 + 5] = 7|C|²\n\nFor normalization, we set ⟨α|α⟩ = 1:\n7|C|² = 1  => |C|² = 1/7  => C = 1/√7 (we can choose the real, positive root for simplicity).\n\nSo, the normalized state is:\n|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]\nIn vector notation, using the basis {|up⟩=[1,0]ᵀ, |down⟩=[0,1]ᵀ}, this is:\n|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ\n\n**2. The Operator A and its Eigenstates/Eigenvalues**\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements Aij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j, and Aij = 0 for i = j. In the {|up⟩, |down⟩} basis, this gives the matrix:\nA = [[A₁₁, A₁₂], [A₂₁, A₂₂]] = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]\nA = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nThis is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix, σₓ.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ) and eigenstates, we solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0:\ndet( [[-λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]] ) = 0\n(-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = 0\nλ² - (ħ²/4) = 0\nλ² = ħ²/4\nλ = ± ħ/2\n\nSo, the two eigenvalues are λ₁ = +ħ/2 and λ₂ = -ħ/2.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding eigenstates (eigenvectors):\n*   For λ₁ = +ħ/2:\n    (A - λ₁I)|v₁⟩ = 0\n    [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]] * [a, b]ᵀ = 0\n    This gives the equation -a(ħ/2) + b(ħ/2) = 0, which simplifies to a = b.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is [1, 1]ᵀ. Normalizing it gives (1/√2)[1, 1]ᵀ.\n    So, |v₁⟩ = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ + |down⟩).\n\n*   For λ₂ = -ħ/2:\n    (A - λ₂I)|v₂⟩ = 0\n    [[ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, ħ/2]] * [a, b]ᵀ = 0\n    This gives the equation a(ħ/2) + b(ħ/2) = 0, which simplifies to a = -b.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is [1, -1]ᵀ. Normalizing it gives (1/√2)[1, -1]ᵀ.\n    So, |v₂⟩ = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ - |down⟩).\n\n**3. Probabilities of Measurement**\n\nThe probability of measuring the particle in a specific eigenstate |v_i⟩ is given by P_i = |⟨v_i|α⟩|².\n\n*   Probability of measuring λ₁ = +ħ/2 (i.e., finding the state |v₁⟩):\n    P₁ = |⟨v₁|α⟩|²\n    ⟨v₁|α⟩ = [(1/√2) * (⟨up| + ⟨down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩)]\n    ⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [(1 * (1+i)) + (1 * (2-i))]\n    ⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [1 + i + 2 - i] = 3/√14\n    P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428\n\n*   Probability of measuring λ₂ = -ħ/2 (i.e., finding the state |v₂⟩):\n    P₂ = |⟨v₂|α⟩|²\n    ⟨v₂|α⟩ = [(1/√2) * (⟨up| - ⟨down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩)]\n    ⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [(1 * (1+i)) - (1 * (2-i))]\n    ⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [1 + i - 2 + i] = (-1 + 2i)/√14\n    P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**4. Average (Expectation) Value of A**\n\nThe average value ⟨A⟩ can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   Method 1: Using probabilities and eigenvalues\n    ⟨A⟩ = Σ P_i * λ_i = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂\n    ⟨A⟩ = (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)\n    ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7\n\n*   Method 2: Using the definition ⟨A⟩ = ⟨α|A|α⟩\n    First, calculate A|α⟩:\n    A|α⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ\n    A|α⟩ = (ħ/(2√7)) * [2-i, 1+i]ᵀ\n    Now, calculate ⟨α|A|α⟩:\n    ⟨A⟩ = [(1/√7) * (1-i, 2+i)] * [(ħ/(2√7)) * (2-i, 1+i)ᵀ]\n    ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]\n    ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [(2 - i - 2i - 1) + (2 + 2i + i - 1)]\n    ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)]\n    ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [2] = ħ/7\n\nBoth methods yield ⟨A⟩ = ħ/7.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated probabilities are ~0.64 and ~0.36, and the average value is ħ/7. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
