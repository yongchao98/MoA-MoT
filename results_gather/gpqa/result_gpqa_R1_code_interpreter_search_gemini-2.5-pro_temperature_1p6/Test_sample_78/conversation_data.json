    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product's Structure from NMR Data**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the reaction product using the provided 1H and 13C NMR data. The molecular formula of the reactant X is C11H12O. Since the reaction is an isomerization (a rearrangement), the product will have the same molecular formula.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C11H12O\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6. This indicates a combination of rings and pi bonds. A benzene ring accounts for 4 DoU.\n\n**Analysis of 13C NMR Data:**\n*   There are 9 signals for 11 carbons, which implies some symmetry in the molecule.\n*   **δ 197.7 ppm:** This high chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), most likely a ketone since there is no aldehyde proton in the 1H NMR. This accounts for one oxygen atom and one degree of unsaturation.\n*   **δ 126.9 (2C) and 129.1 (2C) ppm:** The signals in the aromatic region, with intensities corresponding to 2 carbons each, strongly suggest a symmetrically substituted benzene ring, specifically a 1,4- (para-) disubstituted ring. This accounts for the C6H4 part of the aromatic ring and its 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n*   **δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm:** These are aliphatic carbon signals, characteristic of methyl groups (CH3).\n*   **δ 127.1, 130.3, 141.5, 144.1 ppm:** These are sp2-hybridized carbons (alkene or aromatic). Given we've identified the C6H4 ring, these must account for the two substituted (quaternary) carbons of the ring and the two carbons of a C=C double bond.\n\n**Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and δ 7.08 (2H, d):** This pattern is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The integration of 2H for each doublet confirms the symmetry.\n*   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This indicates two methyl (CH3) groups that are not adjacent to any protons (i.e., they are attached to quaternary carbons or carbons without protons).\n*   **δ 7.68 (1H, d) and δ 6.75 (1H, d):** These are two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton. They are coupled to each other, which is characteristic of a disubstituted carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The large chemical shifts indicate that this double bond is part of a conjugated system.\n\n**Assembling the Product Structure:**\nBased on the fragments identified from the NMR data, we can assemble the structure:\n1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  One substituent is a methyl group (-CH3). The chemical shift of its protons (δ 2.28) and carbon (δ 21.3) are typical for a methyl group on an aromatic ring (a tolyl group).\n3.  The other substituent on the ring is a larger group containing the remaining atoms.\n4.  We have another methyl group (-CH3), a ketone (C=O), and a vinyl group (-CH=CH-).\n5.  Let's assemble these remaining parts: -CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3. This is a but-3-en-2-one moiety.\n6.  Connecting the two main fragments gives the full structure: **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\nLet's check if this structure is consistent with all data:\n*   **Formula:** (CH3-C6H4)-(CH=CH)-(CO-CH3) -> C7H7 + C2H2 + C2H3O = **C11H12O**. Correct.\n*   **NMR Assignment:**\n    *   Ar-CH3: δ 2.28 (s, 3H)\n    *   -CO-CH3: δ 2.31 (s, 3H)\n    *   -CH=CH-CO-: The proton α to the carbonyl (δ 6.75) is upfield from the proton β to the carbonyl (δ 7.68). This fits the known trends for α,β-unsaturated ketones.\n    *   p-Tolyl ring protons: The two doublets at δ 7.08 and δ 7.71 correspond to the four protons on the ring. The structure is fully consistent with the NMR data.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction to Identify Compound X**\n\nThe reaction involves heating (403 K) an epoxide (all options are epoxides) with a base, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), which catalyzes a rearrangement. We need to find which starting material (Compound X) would rearrange to form **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\nThis type of reaction is a known isomerization of vinyl epoxides. Specifically, terminal epoxides adjacent to a double bond can rearrange to form conjugated methyl ketones. The transformation involves the epoxide moiety `-CH(O)CH2` becoming a methyl ketone moiety `-C(=O)CH3`.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:**\n    *   Structure: `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`\n    *   This is a terminal vinyl epoxide. It has a `p-tolyl` group (`p-CH3-C6H4-`) and a conjugated `-CH=CH-` group.\n    *   The rearrangement of its terminal epoxide part (`-CH(O)CH2`) would lead to a methyl ketone (`-CO-CH3`).\n    *   Product: `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CO-CH3`, which is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    *   This exactly matches the product we deduced from the NMR data.\n\n*   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:**\n    *   Structure: `C6H5-CH=C(CH3)-CH(O)CH2`\n    *   This would rearrange to `C6H5-CH=C(CH3)-CO-CH3`.\n    *   This product has a phenyl group (not p-tolyl) and a `-CH=C(CH3)-` vinyl system (not `-CH=CH-`). This contradicts the NMR data.\n\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:**\n    *   Structure: `C6H5-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`\n    *   Formula is C10H10O, which is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:**\n    *   Structure: `C6H5-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH3`\n    *   Formula is C11H12O. This is an internal, not terminal, epoxide.\n    *   Rearrangement would lead to an ethyl ketone (`...-CO-CH2CH3`) or an aldehyde (`...-CH(CH3)CHO`). Neither is a methyl ketone. Furthermore, it has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. This contradicts the NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly compound A, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, rearranges to the product whose spectroscopic data is provided. Therefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<A>>>"
