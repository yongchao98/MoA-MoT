    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars, let's call it `N`, varies with parallax (`plx`) according to the relation:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n    In astronomy, when \"number of stars\" is given as a function of parallax like this, it typically refers to the *cumulative number of stars* that have a parallax greater than or equal to a certain value, `plx`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:**\n    Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to a star. The fundamental relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This means a larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and a smaller parallax corresponds to a larger distance.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:**\n    We can substitute the parallax-distance relationship into the given formula for the number of stars.\n    Since `plx = 1/r`, we have `1/plx = r`.\n    Substituting this into the given relation:\n    `N ∝ (1/plx)^5`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n\n4.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    This result, `N ∝ r^5`, means that the *cumulative number of stars* within a sphere of radius `r` is proportional to `r^5`. We can write this as `N(r) = k * r^5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality and `N(r)` is the total number of stars up to distance `r`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    The question asks for how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This is asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN/dr`. This quantity represents the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `r`.\n    We need to differentiate our expression for `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation, `d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`, we get:\n    `dN/dr = k * (5 * r^(5-1))`\n    `dN/dr = 5k * r^4`\n\n6.  **State the Final Proportionality:**\n    From the derivative, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n7.  **Match with the Options:**\n    Comparing our result with the given options:\n    A) ~ r^5 (This is the cumulative number, not the number per unit distance)\n    B) ~ r^2\n    C) ~ r^3\n    D) ~ r^4 (This matches our result)\n\n<<<D>>>"
