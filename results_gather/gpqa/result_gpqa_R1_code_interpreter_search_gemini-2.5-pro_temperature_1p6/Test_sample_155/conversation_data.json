    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze the Chemical Reactions**\n\nThe overall transformation in both reactions involves two steps:\n1.  **Epoxidation:** Treatment with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA). This is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond to form an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene (E or Z) is preserved in the epoxide.\n2.  **Hydrolysis:** Treatment with aqueous acid (H3O+). This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack), leading to an anti-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n\nThe combination of these two steps (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-opening) results in a net **anti-dihydroxylation** of the starting alkene.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** It undergoes anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two groups to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso** compound. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers, due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol. This molecule has the configuration (4R, 5S) or equivalently (4S, 5R). Let's call this **Product M**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** It undergoes anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two groups to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these enantiomers **Product E1** and **Product E2**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **Product M:** meso-(4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n2.  **Product E1:** (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n3.  **Product E2:** (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nLet's examine the stereochemical relationships between these three compounds:\n*   **E1 and E2** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are **enantiomers**.\n*   **M and E1** have the same molecular formula and connectivity, but they are not mirror images. They are **diastereomers**. (Comparing (4R, 5S) to (4R, 5R)).\n*   **M and E2** are also **diastereomers**. (Comparing (4R, 5S) to (4S, 5S)).\n\n### **Part 3: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe product mixture (containing M, E1, and E2) is analyzed using two different HPLC techniques.\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like E1 and E2) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column. They will have the same retention time and elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like M vs. the E1/E2 pair) have different physical properties. They will interact differently with the stationary phase and will be separated, eluting at different retention times.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: The co-eluting enantiomers (E1 + E2).\n    *   Peak 2: The meso diastereomer (M).\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. The chiral environment allows for differential interaction with enantiomers.\n*   **Enantiomers** (E1 and E2) will bind with different strengths to the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times. Thus, they will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n*   The meso compound (M), being a diastereomer to both E1 and E2, will also have a unique retention time and will be separated from them.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **three peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: Enantiomer E1, (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Peak 2: Enantiomer E2, (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Peak 3: Meso compound M, (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The standard (achiral) HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n*   The chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
