    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3 or -OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents have the following relative positions:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: A strong activating group, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: A weak activating group, ortho-, para-directing. Due to its bulkiness, it often favors substitution at the para position.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: A strong deactivating group, meta-directing.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: A strong activating group, ortho-, para-directing. In strong acid, it forms the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n**3. Propose a Retrosynthetic Strategy**\n\nA common strategy is to work backward from the final product (retrosynthesis).\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group (-OEt) is typically formed from a phenol (-OH) via a Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., using NaOH and ethyl bromide, EtBr). So, the immediate precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **Phenol Formation:** A phenol group (-OH) can be introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (-N2+). A diazonium salt is formed from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization (using NaNO2 and HCl). Therefore, a plausible precursor to the phenol is **1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene** (systematic name: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline).\n\nSo, a key challenge is to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze each sequence to see if it can produce this key intermediate and then convert it to the final product. (Note: The formatting of the options in the prompt appears flawed with extraneous numbers and steps. We will evaluate the chemical logic of the main proposed sequence in each option.)\n\n*   **Option A: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr**\n    *   **i)** Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n    *   **ii)** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is ortho-, para-directing. Due to sterics, the major product is the para isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene), but the ortho isomer (**1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, this step is not ideal, but let's proceed with the ortho isomer.\n    *   **iii)** Reduction of the nitro group. 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Standard reduction).\n    *   **iv)** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial and most problematic step. In the strong acid medium (HNO3/H2SO4), the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). Both the -tBu group (at C1) and the -NH3+ group (at C2) direct incoming electrophiles to positions 4 and 6. They do *not* direct to position 3. Therefore, this step would not produce the required 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline in high yield.\n    *   **However, if we assume for a moment that this step *did* yield the desired 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**, the remaining steps are perfectly logical:\n    *   **v)** Diazotization: Amine → diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi)** Hydrolysis: Diazonium salt → phenol.\n    *   **vii)** Etherification: Phenol → ethoxy ether.\n    This sequence would correctly convert the key intermediate into the final product. The sequence's overall logic is sound, despite the severe regiochemical issue in step (iv).\n\n*   **Option B: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    *   After step iii (sulfonation), the intermediate would be 1-tert-butyl-2-nitro-benzenesulfonic acid. This molecule does not have an amino group.\n    *   **iv)** The reagent NaNO2/HCl is for diazotization of an amine. Using it on the product from step (iii) is chemically incorrect. This option is invalid.\n\n*   **Option C: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    *   **i-iii)** This sequence creates 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. The substituent pattern is 1, 3, 4.\n    *   The goal is a 1, 2, 3 substitution pattern. It is difficult to see how the 1,3,4-patterned intermediate can be converted to the 1,2,3-patterned product. Furthermore, step (vi) in the full list (reacting a diazonium salt with HNO3/H2SO4) is not a standard, productive reaction. This option is invalid.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   **i-ii)** Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   **iii)** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and directing meta. So, this step would produce m-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   **iv)** Nitration of m-tert-butylaniline. The directing effects of the -NH3+ (meta-directing) and -tBu (ortho-, para-directing) groups are in conflict, leading to a mixture of products. It's very unlikely to cleanly produce the required intermediate. This option is invalid.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain definitive chemical errors (e.g., impossible reactions, incorrect starting materials for a step) or lead to intermediates that do not have the correct substitution pattern to form the final product.\n\nOption A presents a sequence where each transformation (e.g., reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) is standard and logically connects the intermediates. The entire plan hinges on the nitration in step (iv), which, according to standard directing rules, should not give the desired product in high yield. However, among the given choices, it is the only one that presents a structurally coherent pathway. In multiple-choice questions of this nature, one often has to select the \"best\" option, even if it contains a flaw. The flaws in B, C, and D are more fundamental than the regiochemical issue in A. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
