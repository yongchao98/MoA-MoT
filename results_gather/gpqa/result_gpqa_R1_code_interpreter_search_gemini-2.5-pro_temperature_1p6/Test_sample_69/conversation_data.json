    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the identity of the compounds and the molecular symmetry of E.\n\n**Step 1: Decode the chemical reactions.**\n\nThe problem provides four chemical reactions:\n1.  **A(s) + 8B(g) -> C (bright red)**\n2.  **C + 2D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)**\n3.  **C + H₂O -> A + F(aq) + G(aq)**, where F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid.\n4.  **D(g) + B(g) -> H (solvent)**, in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Step 2: Identify compounds based on the reaction clues.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4: D(g) + B(g) -> H (solvent)**\n    This is a 1:1 reaction between two gases to form a liquid solvent. A very common and fitting reaction is the synthesis of sulfuryl chloride:\n    SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) -> SO₂Cl₂(l)\n    Sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) is a liquid at room temperature and used as a solvent.\n    Therefore, we can tentatively identify:\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine gas)\n    *   **D = SO₂** (Sulfur dioxide gas)\n    *   **H = SO₂Cl₂** (Sulfuryl chloride)\n\n*   **Reaction 3: C + H₂O -> A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)**\n    This hydrolysis reaction is the most revealing clue. The solid 'A' is reformed, which is characteristic of a disproportionation or comproportionation reaction. Since B is Cl₂, 'C' must be a chloride of some element, and the strong acid 'F' is almost certainly hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n    Let's consider the hydrolysis of an interhalogen compound, iodine monochloride (ICl):\n    5ICl + 3H₂O -> 2I₂(s) + HIO₃(aq) + 5HCl(aq)\n    Let's check if this fits the description:\n    *   'A' is reformed: **A = I₂** (Iodine), which is a solid at room temperature.\n    *   'F' is a strong acid: **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid).\n    *   'G' is a weak acid: **G = HIO₃** (Iodic acid, which is a weaker acid than HCl).\n    *   'C' must therefore be **C = ICl** (Iodine monochloride).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: A(s) + 8B(g) -> C (bright red)**\n    Let's check our identified compounds with this reaction:\n    I₂(s) + 8Cl₂(g) -> ICl (bright red)\n    Iodine monochloride (ICl) is described as a ruby-red or brown-red solid, which fits the \"bright red\" description. However, the known synthesis is I₂ + Cl₂ -> 2ICl, which has a 1:1 stoichiometry, not 1:8. The \"8 equivalents\" is likely a distractor or an error in the problem statement. Given that all other clues fit the iodine-based hypothesis perfectly, we will proceed by assuming A=I₂, B=Cl₂, and C=ICl.\n\n**Step 3: Identify compound E.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: C + 2D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)**\n    Substituting our identified compounds:\n    **ICl + 2SO₂ -> E**\n    The product 'E' is described as extremely hazardous. This reaction involves the Lewis acid ICl and two molecules of the Lewis base SO₂. It is plausible that an adduct is formed: E = ICl(SO₂)₂. Many such adducts of interhalogens are known to be unstable or highly reactive (hazardous).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\nTo find the symmetry of E = ICl(SO₂)₂, we use the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory.\n1.  **Central Atom**: Iodine (I) is the central atom.\n2.  **Valence Electrons of Central Atom**: Iodine is in Group 17, so it has 7 valence electrons.\n3.  **Ligands**: The iodine atom is bonded to one chlorine atom (Cl) and coordinated by two sulfur dioxide molecules (SO₂). The SO₂ molecules act as ligands, donating a lone pair from the sulfur atom to the iodine.\n4.  **Electron Domains**: The central iodine atom has three ligands (one Cl, two SO₂) and must accommodate its own non-bonding valence electrons. The total number of electron domains around the iodine is the sum of its lone pairs and the number of atoms it's bonded to.\n    Let's count the electron pairs: Iodine has 7 valence electrons. Let's assume it forms a single bond to Cl and coordinate bonds with two SO₂. Its original valence shell had 7 electrons. After bonding, it has 3 ligands. Let's count the electron pairs around Iodine to determine the geometry. The total number of electron domains around Iodine will be (number of bonded atoms) + (number of lone pairs).\n    The Iodine atom has 7 valence electrons. It forms a single bond with Cl, leaving 6 electrons (3 lone pairs). The two SO₂ molecules act as Lewis bases and form coordinate bonds to the iodine atom. A more modern view considers all bonds. Let's use the AXE notation.\n    The central atom is I (A). It's bonded to three other groups (X₃). The number of lone pairs (E) is calculated from the valence electrons: (7 - 1 (for Cl bond))/2 = 3 lone pairs. But upon adduct formation with Lewis bases, the electron count is better viewed as hypervalent. The total number of electron pairs around the central atom is 5 (a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement): one pair for the I-Cl bond, one pair for each I-SO₂ bond, and two lone pairs. Total domains = 1 (Cl) + 2 (SO₂) + 2 (lone pairs) = 5.\n5.  **Molecular Geometry**: With 5 electron domains (AX₃E₂ system), the electron geometry is trigonal bipyramidal. To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy equatorial positions. The three ligands (Cl, SO₂, SO₂) are arranged with two in axial positions and one in an equatorial position, or one axial and two equatorial. The most stable arrangement for an AX₃E₂ system places the lone pairs in the equatorial positions, leading to a **T-shaped** molecular geometry.\n6.  **Point Group**: A T-shaped molecule (like ClF₃) has a C₂ axis of rotation and two vertical mirror planes (one of which is the plane of the molecule itself). This corresponds to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   A = I₂\n*   B = Cl₂\n*   C = ICl\n*   D = SO₂\n*   E = ICl(SO₂)₂\n*   F = HCl\n*   G = HIO₃\n*   H = SO₂Cl₂\n\nThe molecule E, which is likely the adduct ICl(SO₂)₂, has a T-shaped geometry, and its molecular symmetry group is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<C>>>"
