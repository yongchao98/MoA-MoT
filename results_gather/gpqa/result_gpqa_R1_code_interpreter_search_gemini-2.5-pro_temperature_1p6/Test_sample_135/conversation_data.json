    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Problem and Define the Vector Field**\n\n*   We are given a vector field `f(r)` that is directed radially outward from the origin.\n*   The magnitude of the field is given by `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the distance from the origin.\n*   In spherical coordinates, a purely radial vector field can be written as `f(r) = |f(r)| * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   Therefore, the vector field is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`.\n*   We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, where `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n### **2. Choose a Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the surface integral of the vector field over the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume `V`.\n\nMathematically: `∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∬_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nThis theorem is particularly useful here because the vector field `f(r)` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), which would make the direct calculation of `∇ ⋅ f` problematic at that point. The Divergence Theorem allows us to bypass this issue by only considering the field on the boundary surface.\n\n### **3. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\n1.  **Identify the surface S:** The surface `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n2.  **Define the surface element dS:** For a sphere, the differential surface element vector `dS` points in the radially outward direction. So, `dS = dS * r̂`. In spherical coordinates, the magnitude of the surface element is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`. Therefore, the vector is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂`.\n3.  **Evaluate the vector field f on the surface S:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, we substitute `r=R` into the expression for `f(r)`:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n4.  **Calculate the dot product f ⋅ dS:**\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂]`\n    Since the dot product of a unit vector with itself is 1 (`r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`), the expression simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n5.  **Set up and evaluate the surface integral:** The integral is taken over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the spherical coordinates `θ` (polar angle) are from `0` to `π`, and for `φ` (azimuthal angle) are from `0` to `2π`.\n\n    `∬_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    Let's evaluate the integral in parts:\n    *   **Inner integral (with respect to θ):**\n        `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   **Outer integral (with respect to φ):**\n        `∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]_0^(2π) = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe result of the surface integral is `4π`. According to the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of the field.\n\n`∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe most appropriate answer is `4π`.\n\n### **(Alternative Method: Direct Calculation with Dirac Delta Function)**\nFor completeness, it's worth noting that the divergence of the field `f(r) = r̂ / r^2` is a special function. For `r ≠ 0`, `∇ ⋅ f = 0`. However, at the singularity `r = 0`, the divergence is undefined in the standard sense and is described by the Dirac delta function: `∇ ⋅ (r̂ / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`.\nThe volume integral then becomes `∫∫∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`. Since the volume (a sphere of radius R) contains the origin (`r=0`), the integral evaluates to `4π`. This confirms the result from the Divergence Theorem.\n\n<<<A>>>"
