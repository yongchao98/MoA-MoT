    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical reaction and equilibrium:**\n    The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$) from calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$) is represented by the following equilibrium:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n\n2.  **Define the formation constant ($K_f$):**\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the formation constant, $K_f$ (also given as KCa-EDTA).\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Consider the dissociation of the complex:**\n    Since we start with the complex, it's easier to consider its dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n    The equilibrium constant for this dissociation ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:**\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $CaY^{2-}$      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n5.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation:**\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[CaY^{2-}]}$\n    Substituting the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\n6.  **Simplify and solve for x:**\n    Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n    Now the equation becomes:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n    Solving for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    Solving for x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n    This value matches option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the initial concentration of the complex and the formation constant\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\nKf = 5e10  # Formation constant\n\n# The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant\nKd = 1 / Kf\n\n# We need to solve the equation: Kd = x^2 / (initial_complex_conc - x)\n# Using the approximation: Kd = x^2 / initial_complex_conc\n# x^2 = Kd * initial_complex_conc\nx_squared = Kd * initial_complex_conc\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The concentration of Ca2+ ions is x\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($[Ca^{2+}]$) in a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant chemical equilibrium.**\n    The Ca-EDTA complex ($[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$) is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($EDTA^{4-}$). Since we start with the complex, we should consider its dissociation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate the formation constant ($K_f$) to the dissociation constant ($K_d$).**\n    The problem gives the formation constant, $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$, which is for the forward reaction ($Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$).\n    The dissociation constant, $K_d$, for the reverse reaction is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n\n    | Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    | :------------------ | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n    | $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n    | $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n    | $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression using the dissociation constant.**\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n    Substituting the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x.**\n    Since $K_d$ is extremely small ($2 \\times 10^{-11}$), the extent of dissociation 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying approximation that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Now, solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Take the square root of both sides to find x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n6.  **Final concentration.**\n    The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
