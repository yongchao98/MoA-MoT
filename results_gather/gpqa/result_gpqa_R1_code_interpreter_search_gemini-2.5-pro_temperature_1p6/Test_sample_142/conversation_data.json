    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the starting materials and products of the given Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Determining Starting Material A**\n\n*   **Product:** `2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one`\n*   **Reaction Type:** Pinacol-Pinacolone Rearrangement. This reaction starts with a 1,2-diol (a di-alcohol where the -OH groups are on adjacent carbons) and, under acidic conditions (H2SO4), rearranges to form a ketone. A key feature of this rearrangement is the possible migration of alkyl or aryl groups, which can include ring expansion or contraction.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product Structure:** The product is a ketone within a six-membered ring (cyclohexanone). There are two `p-tolyl` groups attached to the carbon (C2) adjacent to the carbonyl carbon (C1).\n\n2.  **Work Backwards (Retro-synthesis):**\n    *   The ketone group (C=O) at C1 in the product must have come from an alcohol group (-OH) in the starting material.\n    *   The rearrangement involves a 1,2-shift. The fact that the product has a six-membered ring, and two p-tolyl groups are on C2, suggests a possible ring-expansion from a five-membered ring.\n    *   Let's hypothesize a starting material with a five-membered ring and the necessary groups, as seen in the options: `1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol`.\n\n3.  **Test the Hypothesis (Forward Reaction):**\n    *   **Starting Material A:** `1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol`. This molecule has a cyclopentane ring. At C1 of the ring, there's an -OH group and a `-C(OH)(p-tolyl)2` group. The two alcohol groups are on adjacent carbons, fulfilling the requirement for a pinacol rearrangement.\n        *   The two carbons are: C1 of the cyclopentane ring and the external carbon (`C_alpha`) bearing the two p-tolyl groups.\n    *   **Step 1: Protonation and Carbocation Formation.** The acid (H2SO4) will protonate one of the -OH groups, which then leaves as a water molecule to form a carbocation. The most stable carbocation will be formed preferentially.\n        *   Protonating the -OH on C1 of the cyclopentane ring would form a tertiary carbocation.\n        *   Protonating the -OH on the external carbon (`C_alpha`) would form a tertiary carbocation that is also stabilized by resonance with two `p-tolyl` (aromatic) rings. This benzylic-type carbocation is significantly more stable.\n        *   Therefore, the reaction proceeds by forming the carbocation on the external carbon: `(cyclopentyl)-C1(OH)-C_alpha+(p-tolyl)2`.\n    *   **Step 2: 1,2-Shift (Ring Expansion).** A group from the adjacent carbon (C1) must migrate to the carbocation center (`C_alpha`). The migrating group will be part of the cyclopentane ring (an alkyl shift). This leads to a ring expansion. The five-membered ring incorporates `C_alpha` to become a six-membered ring. The positive charge shifts to C1.\n    *   **Step 3: Deprotonation.** The resulting intermediate has a positive charge on a carbon (the original C1) that also bears an -OH group. This is a resonance-stabilized oxonium ion. Loss of a proton (H+) from the oxygen atom forms a stable ketone (C=O) double bond.\n    *   **Final Product:** The ketone is formed at the original C1 position. The adjacent carbon (the original `C_alpha`) is now part of the six-membered ring and has two `p-tolyl` groups attached. This perfectly matches the product, `2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The starting material A is `1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol`. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n### **Reaction 2: Determining Product B**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** `methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate`\n*   **Reaction Type:** Pinacol-Pinacolone Rearrangement.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material Structure:**\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH(OH)-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-C(=O)OCH3`.\n    *   The 1,2-diol is located at carbons C2 and C3 of the butanoate chain.\n\n2.  **Follow the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Protonation and Carbocation Formation.** The acid protonates an -OH group. We compare the stability of the potential carbocations.\n        *   Option (a): Removing the -OH from C3 creates a secondary carbocation (`CH3-C+H-...`).\n        *   Option (b): Removing the -OH from C2 creates a tertiary carbocation that is also stabilized by the adjacent `p-tolyl` ring (`...-C+(p-tolyl)-...`).\n        *   The tertiary, benzylic carbocation at C2 is more stable than the secondary carbocation at C3. Thus, the reaction proceeds through the C2 carbocation.\n    *   **Step 2: 1,2-Shift.** A group from the adjacent carbon (C3) migrates to the carbocation at C2. The groups on C3 are a hydrogen atom (-H) and a methyl group (-CH3).\n        *   The migratory aptitude follows the order: H > alkyl > aryl. Therefore, the hydrogen atom will preferentially migrate (a 1,2-hydride shift).\n    *   **Step 3: Deprotonation.** The hydrogen moves from C3 to C2. The positive charge effectively moves to C3, which still has its -OH group. This forms a protonated ketone (an oxonium ion). Deprotonation of this oxygen yields the final ketone product.\n    *   **Final Product Structure:** The ketone group (C=O) is now at the C3 position. The `p-tolyl` group remains on C2, which has also gained a hydrogen. The structure is: `CH3-C(=O)-CH(p-tolyl)-C(=O)OCH3`.\n\n3.  **Name the Product (B):**\n    *   Following IUPAC nomenclature, the ester has priority, so the main chain is a butanoate.\n    *   Numbering starts from the ester's carbonyl carbon as C1.\n    *   `C1`: Ester carbonyl (`-C(=O)OCH3`)\n    *   `C2`: Has the `p-tolyl` group attached.\n    *   `C3`: Is the new ketone carbonyl (`-C(=O)-`).\n    *   `C4`: Is the terminal methyl group (`-CH3`).\n    *   The systematic name is **`methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate`**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The product B is `methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate`. This eliminates option C.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is `1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol`.\n*   Product **B** is `methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate`.\n\nComparing this with the given choices:\n*   A) A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate\n*   B) A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate\n*   C) A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate\n*   D) A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate\n\nThe only option that matches both conclusions is **A**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
