    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:**\n    The problem involves a harmonic oscillator at relativistic speeds. The key principle to use is the conservation of energy. In a relativistic system, we must use the relativistic expression for kinetic energy.\n\n2.  **Define the states of the system:**\n    The problem asks for the maximum speed ($v_{max}$). For a harmonic oscillator, the speed is maximum when the mass passes through the equilibrium position ($x=0$), and the speed is zero at the points of maximum displacement (the amplitude, $x = \\pm A$). We will compare the total energy of the system at these two points.\n\n    *   **State 1: At maximum displacement, $x=A$.**\n        *   The position is $x=A$.\n        *   The speed is $v=0$.\n        *   The potential energy, given by Hooke's Law ($F=-kx$), is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. At $x=A$, the potential energy is $U_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   The relativistic kinetic energy is $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   At $v=0$, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$. So the kinetic energy is $K = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        *   The total energy in this state is $E_1 = K + U = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **State 2: At the equilibrium position, $x=0$.**\n        *   The position is $x=0$.\n        *   The speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        *   The potential energy is $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The kinetic energy is at its maximum, $K_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n        *   The total energy in this state is $E_2 = K + U = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy:**\n    The total energy of the isolated oscillator system is conserved. Therefore, the total energy in State 1 must equal the total energy in State 2.\n    $E_1 = E_2$\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n4.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$:**\n    We need to rearrange the equation to isolate $v_{max}$. First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$.\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Next, square both sides to remove the square root:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to solve for $v_{max}^2/c^2$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This matches option B exactly.\n\n*   Option A is incorrect because it would imply $v_{max}>c$.\n*   Option C is the non-relativistic (classical) answer, which is an approximation valid only for low speeds.\n*   Option D is dimensionally inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
