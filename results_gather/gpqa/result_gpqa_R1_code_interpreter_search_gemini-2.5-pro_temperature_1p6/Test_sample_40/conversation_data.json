    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference, which is considered stationary.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference moving along with the piece of glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **v:** This is the velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, so we can take this velocity as `+v`.\n    *   **u':** This is the velocity of the light beam relative to the glass frame (S'). By definition, the speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since the problem specifies `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass (as measured in the glass's own rest frame) is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **u:** This is the velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory frame (S). This is the quantity we need to calculate.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Law:**\n    Since the problem involves velocities that can be a fraction of the speed of light (`c`), we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation (also known as the relativistic velocity addition formula), not the classical Galilean transformation (`u = u' + v`).\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities along the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute the values we identified in step 2 into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    The formula becomes:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Algebraic Expression:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both the top and bottom of the main fraction by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    Distribute the `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n\n    Simplify the terms:\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived result is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Comparing this with the given choices:\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n+v) - This matches our result.\n    B) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    D) 1\n\n    The correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
