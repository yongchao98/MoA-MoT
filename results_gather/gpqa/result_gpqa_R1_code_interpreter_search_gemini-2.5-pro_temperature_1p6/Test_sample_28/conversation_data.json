    "Here is the thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to identify a mutation that will most likely eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to inactivate the protein. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a mutation that prevents a functional protein from being made.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:**\n    *   The sequence starts with `5’-ATG...`. `ATG` is the universal start codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine (Met) and initiates protein synthesis (translation).\n    *   The DNA sequence is read in groups of three called codons.\n    *   Intact gene codons: `ATG` (Met) - `TTT` (Phe) - `CTC` (Leu) - `GCT` (Ala) - `GGT` (Gly) - ...\n    *   This initial part of the protein sequence is Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-...\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Mutant Mutation's Effect:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCT...`\n        *   Codons: `ATG` (Met) - `TTC` (Phe) - `TAC` (Tyr) - `GCT` (Ala) - ...\n        *   Comparison to Intact:\n            *   The second codon `TTT` has become `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**; it has no effect on the protein sequence.\n            *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has become `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, meaning it changes one amino acid for another.\n        *   **Impact:** A single amino acid change might disrupt protein function, but it could also have little or no effect. It is not a guaranteed way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT...`\n        *   Codons: `ATG` (Met) - `TTC` (Phe) - `TAA` (Stop) - ...\n        *   Comparison to Intact:\n            *   Similar to Mutant 1, the second codon has a silent mutation (`TTT` -> `TTC`).\n            *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has become `TAA`. **`TAA` is a stop codon.**\n        *   **Impact:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The stop codon signals the ribosome to terminate translation. The resulting protein will be extremely short (only Met-Phe) and is almost certain to be completely non-functional. This is a very effective way to \"knock out\" a gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCT...`\n        *   Codons: `ATG` (Met) - `TTT` (Phe) - `TAC` (Tyr) - `GCT` (Ala) - ...\n        *   Comparison to Intact:\n            *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   **Impact:** This is a **missense mutation**, identical in effect to the main change in Mutant 1. It is not guaranteed to eliminate protein function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...`\n        *   Comparison to Intact (`...GCT-GGT-ACT...`): This sequence has had the codon `GGT` deleted. It also contains the same missense mutation as Mutant 3 (`CTC` -> `TAC`).\n        *   **Impact:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases, which is one full codon) combined with a missense mutation. While deleting an amino acid is more disruptive than just changing one, the reading frame of the rest of the gene remains intact. The resulting protein might be non-functional, but it's less certain than the effect of a premature stop codon.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We are looking for the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the compound.\n    *   Missense mutations (Mutant 1, Mutant 3) and in-frame deletions (Mutant 4) might inactivate the protein, but they are not guaranteed to do so.\n    *   A nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most reliable and direct way among the choices to ensure the gene product is eliminated.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
