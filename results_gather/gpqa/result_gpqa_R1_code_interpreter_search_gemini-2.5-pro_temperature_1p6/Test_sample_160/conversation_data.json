    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions:**\n    *   **Mean Free Path (MFP):** This is the average distance a particle travels between collisions with other particles.\n    *   **λ1:** The mean free path of gas molecules colliding with *each other*.\n    *   **λ2:** The mean free path of electrons from the TEM beam colliding with the *gas molecules*.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Formula for Mean Free Path:**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that one particle presents to another for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Compare the Scenarios:**\n    *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collision):**\n        *   The \"projectiles\" are gas molecules.\n        *   The \"targets\" are also gas molecules.\n        *   The number density of targets is `n`.\n        *   The collision is essentially a \"billiard ball\" type interaction, governed by the physical size of the molecules. Let's call this cross-section `σ_gas-gas` (σ1). It is proportional to the square of the molecular diameter.\n        *   So, `λ1 ≈ 1 / (n * σ_gas-gas)` (A more precise formula includes a √2 factor to account for the movement of target molecules, but we only need a relative comparison).\n\n    *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collision):**\n        *   The \"projectiles\" are high-energy electrons.\n        *   The \"targets\" are the gas molecules.\n        *   The number density of targets is the *same* `n`, as the gas conditions (pressure, temperature) have not changed.\n        *   The collision is fundamentally different. An electron is a charged particle. A gas molecule, though neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a negatively charged electron cloud. The fast-moving electron from the beam interacts with the molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. It doesn't need to physically \"hit\" the nucleus; it can be significantly deflected (scattered) by the molecule's electric field even from a considerable distance.\n        *   This means the effective target area for an electron scattering event (`σ_electron-gas`, which is σ2) is much larger than the physical cross-section of the molecule (`σ_gas-gas`, which is σ1).\n        *   So, `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_electron-gas)`.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   We have established that the number density of target gas molecules, `n`, is the same for both calculations.\n    *   We have reasoned that the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule is larger than for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule: `σ_electron-gas > σ_gas-gas`, or `σ2 > σ1`.\n    *   Now let's look at the formulas:\n        *   λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1)\n        *   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)\n    *   Since `σ2` is larger than `σ1`, and it is in the denominator, the resulting value for `λ2` must be smaller than `λ1`.\n    *   An intuitive way to think about it: A larger \"target area\" (cross-section) means a collision is more likely to happen. If collisions are more frequent, the average distance traveled between them (the mean free path) must be shorter.\n\nTherefore, the mean free path of electrons scattering off gas molecules (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path of gas molecules scattering off each other (λ1).\n\n<<<C>>>"
