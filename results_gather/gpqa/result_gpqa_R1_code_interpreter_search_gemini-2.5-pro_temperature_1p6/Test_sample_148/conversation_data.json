    "This problem requires an analysis of spectroscopic and chromatographic data for a synthesized peptide. Let's break down the observations to determine the most likely explanation.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Observations:**\n\n*   **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. This indicates the proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   The peaks have similar chemical shifts, suggesting the two environments are structurally very similar.\n    *   The integrals are roughly equal and sum to one proton, which means the two species containing these different protons are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the splitting is not due to adjacent protons.\n\n*   **LC-MS Data:**\n    *   There are two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram, confirming the presence of two different chemical species that can be separated. The equal intensities of the peaks corroborate the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n    *   Crucially, both species give the *same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected product. This tells us the two species are **isomers** of each other – they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass.\n    *   The observation at \"elevated temperature\" is also a clue. For some types of isomers (like conformers), temperature can affect the rate of interconversion and their separability.\n\n**2. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and have identical NMR spectra. Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would show only *one* peak for the alpha-proton, not two. Similarly, they cannot be separated by standard (achiral) LC. This option is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereoisomers will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that the alpha-proton in two different diastereomers would have a different chemical shift, leading to two separate peaks.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography.\n    *   **Isomerism:** Diastereomers are isomers, so they have the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Source in Peptides:** In peptide chemistry, diastereomers can arise in two common ways:\n        1.  **Epimerization:** One of the chiral centers (an alpha-carbon) may have partially or fully inverted its stereochemistry during a harsh synthesis step (e.g., L-amino acid becomes a mixture of L and D). If the peptide has other chiral centers, this creates a mixture of diastereomers (e.g., an L-L-L peptide contaminated with D-L-L).\n        2.  **Cis/Trans Isomerism:** The peptide (amide) bond has a high degree of double-bond character, restricting rotation. While most peptide bonds strongly favor the *trans* conformation, the bond preceding a proline residue (the X-Pro bond) has a much lower energy difference between *cis* and *trans* forms. This rotation is slow on the NMR timescale, leading to two distinct populations of molecules (*cis* and *trans* conformers) at room temperature. These conformers are a form of diastereomerism (specifically, they are atropisomers) and give two full sets of NMR signals and can often be separated by LC. The observation of two species in a ~1:1 ratio is very common for X-Pro bonds.\n    This explanation perfectly fits all the observations.\n\n*   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor molecule from the synthesis would have a different chemical formula and therefore a different molecular weight. This is directly contradicted by the LC-MS data, which shows that both peaks have the same mass spectrum as the target molecule.\n\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This side reaction would create a product with a different structure and a different molecular formula (it would contain an extra amino acid residue). Like the precursor, this would result in a different mass, which is contradicted by the LC-MS data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to the presence of two isomers that are not enantiomers. They have different physical properties (separable by LC) and are chemically distinct (giving different NMR signals), but have the same mass. This is the definition of diastereomers. The phenomenon described is a classic textbook example of diastereomers (most likely *cis/trans* isomers around a proline residue) being observed in peptide analysis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
