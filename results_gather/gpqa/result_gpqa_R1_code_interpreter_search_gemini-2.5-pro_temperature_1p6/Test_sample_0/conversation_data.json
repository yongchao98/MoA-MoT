    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem involves distinguishing two energy levels that have finite lifetimes. This immediately points to the Heisenberg Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **State the Uncertainty Principle:** The principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's energy (ΔE) to its lifetime (Δt). A common form of the relation is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ\n    where ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant. A finite lifetime (Δt) means that the energy of the state is not perfectly defined; it has an inherent \"width\" or uncertainty (ΔE).\n\n3.  **Define the Resolvability Condition:** For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their central energies (|E1 - E2|) must be significantly larger than the sum of their individual energy widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2). At a minimum, the energy difference should be on the order of the larger energy width.\n\n4.  **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1, Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2, Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units that are convenient for this problem, which is electron-volts times seconds (eV·s).\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State:**\n    *   We can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty using the formula ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n6.  **Determine the Minimum Required Energy Separation:**\n    *   The two energy levels have widths of roughly 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV and 6.6 × 10⁻⁸ eV. The first state has a shorter lifetime, so it has a larger energy uncertainty. This larger uncertainty is the dominant factor.\n    *   For the levels to be resolved, the energy separation |E1 - E2| must be significantly greater than the larger of these two widths. Let's say |E1 - E2| > ΔE1.\n    *   So, the required energy difference must be significantly greater than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A more stringent condition is that the separation should be larger than the sum of the widths:\n        *   Sum of widths = ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   In either case, the required separation is on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV or greater.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Let's compare the required separation (~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV) with the given options:\n        *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than the uncertainty. The levels would overlap completely.\n        *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than the uncertainty. The levels would overlap completely.\n        *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is about 1000 times larger than the uncertainty (10⁻⁴ >> 7 × 10⁻⁷). The levels would be very clearly resolved.\n        *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than the uncertainty. The levels would overlap completely.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The only energy difference large enough to allow the two energy levels to be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\nTo verify the calculation precisely, I will use a Python script.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_ev_s = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two quantum states\nlifetime1 = 1e-9  # seconds\nlifetime2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using the formula Delta_E ~ hbar / Delta_t\ndelta_E1 = hbar_ev_s / lifetime1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_ev_s / lifetime2\n\n# To clearly resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be significantly\n# larger than their energy widths.

    "This problem is governed by the **Heisenberg Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle**, which relates the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) to its lifetime (Δt). The relationship is approximately:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nThis principle means that a state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly defined energy; its energy level has an inherent \"width\" or uncertainty (ΔE). For two such energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. A good criterion for this is that the energy difference |E₁ - E₂| should be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂).\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy width (uncertainty) for each state:**\n    We can approximate the minimum energy width using ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n2.  **Determine the condition for resolvability:**\n    The energy level with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁). This larger width is the dominant factor. To clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them should be much larger than this width. At a minimum, the difference should be larger than the sum of the widths:\n\n    Total width ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 × 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    So, the required energy difference must be significantly greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n3.  **Compare with the given options:**\n\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than the required separation.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is also much smaller than the required separation.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than the required separation (10⁻⁴ is over 100 times larger than 7 × 10⁻⁷).\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than the required separation.\n\nOnly the energy difference in option C is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished, as it far exceeds the combined energy widths of the states.\n\n<<<C>>>"
