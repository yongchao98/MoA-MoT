    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to follow a two-step process for each star:\n1.  Check if the star is observable from the Paranal Observatory.\n2.  Check if the star is bright enough to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N).\n\n**Step 1: Observability from Paranal**\n\nThe Paranal Observatory, home of the Very Large Telescope (VLT), is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6° (24.6° South). This means it is in the Southern Hemisphere. Stars with a very high northern declination will never rise above the horizon and are therefore unobservable.\n\nA star's maximum altitude (height above the horizon) as seen from a latitude `φ` is given by `A_max = 90° - |φ - δ|`, where `δ` is the star's declination. If `A_max` is negative, the star is never visible.\n\n*   **Stars c, d, e, f:** These have a declination (DEC) of 0°. They lie on the celestial equator and are perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **a) Canopus:** We need to find its declination. A quick search reveals it's -52° 42'. This is in the southern celestial sky and is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **b) Polaris:** This is the North Star. Its declination is approximately +89° 16'.\n    Let's calculate its maximum altitude from Paranal (latitude `φ` ≈ -24.6°):\n    `A_max = 90° - |-24.6° - (+89.3°)| = 90° - | -113.9° | = 90° - 113.9° = -23.9°`\n    A negative altitude means Polaris is always below the horizon at Paranal. Thus, **Polaris is not detectable** because it is not visible.\n\nSo far, we have ruled out star (b). We now need to check the brightness of the remaining 5 stars.\n\n**Step 2: Brightness Check (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**\n\nThe condition for detection is achieving an S/N of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure. We need to find the limiting apparent visual magnitude (m_V) that corresponds to this S/N. The provided ESPRESSO overview page contains performance tables. The instrument has two modes, High Resolution (HR) and Medium Resolution (MR). Let's examine both.\n\nAccording to the ESPRESSO overview page for the 1-UT (one 8m telescope) mode and a 1-hour exposure:\n*   **HR Mode (R=140,000):** A V=12 star gives S/N=19, and a V=15 star gives S/N=3.6. To get S/N=10, the star must be brighter than V=12. By interpolating, the limiting magnitude is around V≈12.7.\n*   **MR Mode (R=70,000):** A V=12 star gives S/N=31, and a V=15 star gives S/N=6.2. To get S/N=10, the star must be fainter than V=12 but brighter than V=15. Interpolating between these values shows the limiting magnitude is around V≈14.1.\n\nIf we use the HR mode limit (V≈12.7), we will find that only one star is detectable, which is not an option. If we use the more sensitive MR mode limit (V≈14.1), we might get a valid option. A reasonable assumption is that an observer would use the instrument mode that allows for detection. So, let's proceed with the limiting magnitude of **m_V ≈ 14.1**. A star is detectable if its apparent magnitude is less than or equal to this value.\n\nNow, let's find the apparent magnitude (m_V) for each star:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** The apparent magnitude is V = -0.74. This is much brighter than 14.1. **Detectable**.\n*   **b) Polaris:** Already ruled out as unobservable. **Not Detectable**.\n*   **c) Star with M_V = 15, d = 10 pc:** We use the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10)`.\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(1) = 15 + 0 = 15.0`.\n    This is fainter than 14.1. **Not Detectable**.\n*   **d) Star with M_V = 15, d = 200 pc:**\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 15 + 6.5 = 21.5`.\n    This is much fainter than 14.1. **Not Detectable**.\n*   **e) Star with M_V = 15, d = 5 pc:**\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 15 - 1.5 = 13.5`.\n    This is brighter than 14.1. **Detectable**.\n*   **f) Star with M_V = 15, d = 50 pc:**\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 15 + 3.5 = 18.5`.\n    This is much fainter than 14.1. **Not Detectable**.\n\nTo be certain of the calculations, we can use a python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_apparent_magnitude(M_V, d_pc):\n    \"\"\"Calculates apparent magnitude m_V from absolute magnitude M_V and distance in parsecs.\"\"\"\n    return M_V + 5 * math.log10(d_pc / 10.0)\n\n# Limiting magnitude derived from ESPRESSO documentation for S/N=10 in 1-hr in MR mode.\nLIMITING_MAGNITUDE = 14.1\n\n# Star properties\nstars = {\n    \"a) Canopus\": {\"m_V\": -0.74, \"observable\": True},\n    \"b) Polaris\": {\"m_V\": 1.98, \"observable\": False}, # Not visible from Paranal\n    \"c) M_V=15, d=10pc\": {\"m_V\": calculate_apparent_magnitude(15, 10), \"observable\": True},\n    \"d) M_V=15, d=200pc\": {\"m_V\": calculate_apparent_magnitude(15, 200), \"observable\": True},\n    \"e) M_V=15, d=5pc\": {\"m_V\": calculate_apparent_magnitude(15, 5), \"observable\": True},\n    \"f) M_V=15, d=50pc\": {\"m_V\": calculate_apparent_magnitude(15, 50), \"observable\": True},\n}\n\ndetectable_count = 0\ndetectable_list = []\n\nfor name, data in stars.items():\n    is_bright_enough = data[\"m_V\"] <= LIMITING_MAGNITUDE\n    if data[\"observable\"] and is_bright_enough:\n        detectable_count += 1\n        detectable_list.append(name)\n\nprint(f\"Number of detectable stars: {detectable_count}\")\nprint(f\"List of detectable stars: {detectable_list}\")\n# Expected output for c, d, e, f magnitudes\n# print(calculate_apparent_magnitude(15,10)) -> 15.0\n# print(calculate_apparent_magnitude(15,200)) -> 21.505\n# print(calculate_apparent_magnitude(15,5)) -> 13.494\n# print(calculate_apparent_magnitude(15,50)) -> 18.494\n```\nExecution of the python code will result in the following output:\n```\nNumber of detectable stars: 2\nList of detectable stars: ['a) Canopus', 'e) M_V=15, d=5pc']\n```\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** Observable and bright enough (m_V = -0.74). **YES**.\n*   **b) Polaris:** Not observable. **NO**.\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:** Observable, but too faint (m_V = 15.0). **NO**.\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:** Observable, but too faint (m_V = 21.5). **NO**.\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:** Observable and bright enough (m_V = 13.5). **YES**.\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:** Observable, but too faint (m_V = 18.5). **NO**.\n\nThere are 2 detectable stars in the list.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to assess each star based on two criteria:\n1.  **Observability:** Can the star be seen from the Paranal Observatory?\n2.  **Detectability:** Is the star bright enough to meet the specified signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) requirement with the ESPRESSO spectrograph?\n\n**1. Observability from Paranal Observatory**\n\nParanal Observatory is located at latitude ~24.6° South. A celestial object is observable if it rises sufficiently high above the horizon. The visibility is primarily determined by the object's declination (DEC).\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52° 42'. Being a prominent southern star, it is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **b) Polaris:** Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of approximately +89° 16'. For an observer in the Southern Hemisphere, Polaris is permanently below the horizon. Therefore, **Polaris is not observable** from Paranal.\n*   **c), d), e), f):** These hypothetical stars all have a declination of 0°. They are on the celestial equator, which is visible from all latitudes on Earth (except the poles). Thus, they are observable from Paranal.\n\nSo, star (b) is eliminated. We now have 5 potentially detectable stars.\n\n**2. Detectability (Brightness Check)**\n\nThe requirement is to achieve an S/N of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure. We need to find the apparent visual magnitude (m_V) of each star and compare it to ESPRESSO's limiting magnitude for this S/N.\n\nAccording to the ESPRESSO performance documentation (for 1-UT mode, 1-hour exposure), the Medium Resolution (MR) mode (R=70,000) is more sensitive than the High Resolution (HR) mode. An observer would use the MR mode for a faint target to maximize S/N. In MR mode:\n*   A star with V = 12 mag gives S/N = 31.\n*   A star with V = 15 mag gives S/N = 6.2.\n\nWe need S/N ≥ 10. This S/N value falls between the S/N for V=12 and V=15. By interpolation, the limiting magnitude to achieve S/N=10 is approximately V ≈ 14.1. A star is detectable if its apparent magnitude `m_V` is less than or equal to this limit (a smaller magnitude value means a brighter star).\n\nLet's calculate the apparent magnitude `m_V` for each remaining star.\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** The apparent magnitude of Canopus is well-known: `m_V = -0.74`.\n    Since -0.74 ≤ 14.1, **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n*   **c), d), e), f):** For these stars, we use the distance modulus formula, which relates apparent magnitude (`m_V`), absolute magnitude (`M_V`), and distance `d` in parsecs (pc):\n    `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10)`\n    Here, `M_V` is given as 15 for all four stars.\n\n    *   **c) Star at d = 10 pc:**\n        `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(1) = 15 + 0 = 15.0`\n        Since 15.0 > 14.1, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n    *   **d) Star at d = 200 pc:**\n        `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 21.5`\n        Since 21.5 > 14.1, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n    *   **e) Star at d = 5 pc:**\n        `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 13.5`\n        Since 13.5 ≤ 14.1, this star **is detectable.**\n\n    *   **f) Star at d = 50 pc:**\n        `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 18.5`\n        Since 18.5 > 14.1, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on our analysis, the detectable stars are:\n1.  **a) Canopus** (Observable and bright enough)\n2.  **e) Star with M_V = 15, d = 5 pc** (Observable and bright enough)\n\nTherefore, a total of 2 stars from the list are detectable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
