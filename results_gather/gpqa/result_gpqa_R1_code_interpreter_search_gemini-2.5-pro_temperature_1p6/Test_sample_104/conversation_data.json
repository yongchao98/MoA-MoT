    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the source of brightness variation**\n\nThe star's brightness varies because of its rotation. It has two distinct hemispheres:\n*   An unspotted hemisphere.\n*   A hemisphere covered 20% by dark spots.\n\nWhen the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, the star is at its maximum brightness (F_max).\nWhen the spotty hemisphere faces the observer, the star is at its minimum brightness (F_min).\n\nThe amplitude of the variation in the light curve is given by `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n\n**2. Model the flux from the star**\n\nAccording to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the flux (energy radiated per unit area) from a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T⁴). We can model the total observed flux by considering the projected area of the star's disk.\n\n*   **F_max:** The entire visible disk has the star's effective temperature, T_star = 6000 K.\n    Let F_star be the flux from this unspotted disk. We can write `F_max = F_star ∝ A_disk * T_star⁴`, where `A_disk` is the area of the projected disk.\n\n*   **F_min:** The spotty hemisphere is facing the observer. We assume the spots are uniformly distributed over that hemisphere. This means that when this hemisphere is viewed face-on, the spots cover a fraction of the projected disk's area equal to the filling factor, `f_spot = 0.20`.\n    *   The fraction of the disk at T_star is `(1 - f_spot) = 0.80`.\n    *   The fraction of the disk at the spot temperature, T_spot, is `f_spot = 0.20`.\n    *   The spot temperature is `T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n\n    The minimum flux is the sum of the contributions from the hot and cool parts of the disk:\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * A_disk * T_star⁴ + f_spot * A_disk * T_spot⁴`\n\n**3. Calculate the amplitude due to spots**\n\nNow we can calculate the relative amplitude of the light curve:\n`Amplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nLet's substitute the expressions for flux (the proportionality constants and `A_disk` will cancel out):\n`Amplitude_spot = (T_star⁴ - [(1 - f_spot) * T_star⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = (T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f_spot * T_star⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = (f_spot * T_star⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n`f_spot = 0.20`\n`T_star = 6000 K`\n`T_spot = 5000 K`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴) = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n\n**4. Model the exoplanet transit**\n\nThe problem asks for the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal on a non-spotty star. The signal from a transiting exoplanet is a dip in brightness called the transit depth. Assuming no limb darkening, this depth is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n`Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\nwhere `R_pl` is the planet's radius and `R_star` is the star's radius.\n\n**5. Equate the amplitudes and solve**\n\nTo find the required planet size, we set the two amplitudes equal:\n`Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spot`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n\nNow, we solve for the ratio `R_pl / R_star`:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴))`\n\nLet's perform the final calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nT_star = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_diff = 1000.0  # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\nf_spot = 0.20    # Filling factor of the spots on one hemisphere\n\n# Calculate spot temperature\nT_spot = T_star - T_diff\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the light curve variation due to spots.\n# Amplitude_spot = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\namplitude_spot = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\n\n# The amplitude of the signal from an exoplanet transit is (R_pl / R_star)**2.\n# We set this equal to the amplitude from the spots and solve for the radius ratio.\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(Amplitude_spot)\nrpl_rstar_ratio = math.sqrt(amplitude_spot)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated radius ratio R_pl/R_star is: {rpl_rstar_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n<<<\nThe calculated radius ratio R_pl/R_star is: 0.3218\n>>>\nThe calculation shows that the required ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to equate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots with the transit depth caused by a hypothetical exoplanet.\n\n**1. Calculate the brightness variation due to starspots.**\n\nThe variation in the star's flux is due to its rotation, which alternatively shows a fully bright hemisphere and a partially spotted hemisphere.\n\n*   Let `F_max` be the flux when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, flux is proportional to `A * T⁴`, where `A` is the radiating area and `T` is the effective temperature. We can normalize the flux from the unspotted star to 1.\n    `F_max ∝ T_star⁴` where `T_star = 6000 K`.\n\n*   Let `F_min` be the flux when the hemisphere with spots faces the observer. This hemisphere has a fraction `f_spot = 0.20` of its area covered by cooler spots.\n    *   The temperature of the spots is `T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The flux from this hemisphere is a combination of the flux from the unspotted part (`1 - f_spot`) and the spotted part (`f_spot`).\n    *   `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_star⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`\n\n*   The relative amplitude of the variation caused by the spots is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    *   `Amplitude_spot = (T_star⁴ - [(1 - f_spot) * T_star⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴`\n    *   `Amplitude_spot = (T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f_spot * T_star⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n    *   `Amplitude_spot = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n\n*   Plugging in the values:\n    *   `Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n    *   `Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n    *   `Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)`\n    *   `Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * 0.51775 = 0.10355`\n\n**2. Calculate the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.**\n\nThe signal from a transiting exoplanet, which is the drop in brightness, is equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n*   `Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n    where `R_pl` is the planet's radius and `R_star` is the star's radius.\n\n**3. Equate the two amplitudes and solve.**\n\nWe need the signal from the planet to have the same amplitude as the signal from the spots.\n\n*   `Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spot`\n*   `(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n*   `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThe result `~0.32` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
