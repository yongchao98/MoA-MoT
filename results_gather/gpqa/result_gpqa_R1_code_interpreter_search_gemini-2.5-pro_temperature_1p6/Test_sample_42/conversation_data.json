    "This problem requires us to determine the correct IUPAC name for a complex substituted benzene molecule. We must follow a systematic approach based on IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule\nThe molecule contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), a cyano (-CN), a hydroxyl (-OH), a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and a methoxy (-OCH3) group. According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n### Step 2: Decode the Positional Information to Build the Structure\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description:\n\n1.  **-COOH is at C1.**\n2.  **Groups meta to one another:** Carboxylic acid (at C1), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) are all meta to each other. This means they must occupy positions 1, 3, and 5. So, the -CHO and -CN groups are at C3 and C5. We don't yet know which is which.\n3.  **Group para to -COOH:** The methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the C1, so it is at **C4**.\n4.  **Groups ortho to -COOH:** The hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are ortho to C1, so they are at C2 and C6. We don't yet know which is which.\n5.  **Final Clues:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" The methoxy group is at C4. The alcohol is the hydroxyl group (-OH). The nitrile is the cyano group (-CN). This statement allows us to resolve the ambiguities.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the position of the cyano group:\n\n*   **Possibility A: Cyano group is at C3.**\n    *   The methoxy group at C4 is ortho to C3. This fits.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the cyano group at C3. This means the -OH group must be at C2 or C4. Since C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group, the **-OH group must be at C2**.\n    *   This forces the **dimethylamino group to be at C6** (the other ortho position to C1).\n    *   This forces the **carbaldehyde (-CHO) group to be at C5** (the other meta position).\n    *   **Structure A:** C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH3)2).\n\n*   **Possibility C: Cyano group is at C5.**\n    *   The methoxy group at C4 is ortho to C5. This fits.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the cyano group at C5. This means the -OH group must be at C4 or C6. Since C4 is already occupied, the **-OH group must be at C6**.\n    *   This forces the **dimethylamino group to be at C2**.\n    *   This forces the **carbaldehyde (-CHO) group to be at C3**.\n    *   **Structure C:** C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH3)2), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CN), C6(-OH).\n\nBoth structures satisfy all the positional descriptions in the question.\n\n### Step 3: Apply IUPAC Rules for Numbering\nWe have two valid numbering schemes that result from placing the substituents. To decide which one is correct, we apply the IUPAC rule for numbering:\n\n1.  Assign the lowest possible locants (numbers) to the substituents.\n    *   For Structure A, the locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   For Structure C, the locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   Since the locant sets are identical, this rule results in a tie.\n\n2.  When the locant sets are identical, the tie is broken by giving the lower number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n    *   First, let's list all the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order:\n        *   **c**yano\n        *   **d**imethylamino\n        *   **f**ormyl\n        *   **h**ydroxy\n        *   **m**ethoxy\n    *   The first substituent in alphabetical order is \"cyano\".\n    *   In Structure A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Structure C, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme for **Structure A is the correct one**.\n\n### Step 4: Construct the Final Name\nWe use the numbering from Structure A and arrange the substituents in alphabetical order.\n\n*   **Correct Structure (A):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n*   **Substituents with locants:**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\n*   **Assemble the name alphabetically:**\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
