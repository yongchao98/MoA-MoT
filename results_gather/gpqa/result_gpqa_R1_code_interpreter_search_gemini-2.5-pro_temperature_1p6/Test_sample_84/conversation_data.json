    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its host star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) / (4) )^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / a)\n(A more common form is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4). Both are proportional to 1/sqrt(a) so the ratio remains the same)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 = T_star * ((1 - A_1) / 4)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / a_1)\nT_eq2 = T_star * ((1 - A_2) / 4)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / a_2)\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, all terms cancel out except for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / a_1) / sqrt(R_star / a_2)\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt( (R_star / a_1) * (a_2 / R_star) )\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**4. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe information about the Doppler shift (Δλ) allows us to determine the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K). For a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem) and an observation angle close to edge-on (i ≈ 90°, which is a valid assumption for planets detected by both transit and RV methods), the formula for K is:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p\n\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and v_p is the planet's orbital velocity.\n\nThe orbital velocity (v_p) for a circular orbit is given by:\nv_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nSubstituting v_p into the formula for K:\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nK = (M_p * sqrt(G)) / sqrt(M_star * a)\n\nNow, we solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\nK^2 = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1 using the formula derived above:\n\na_2 / a_1 = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant G and the star's mass M_star are the same for both systems and cancel out:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\n**6. Determine the Ratios of Mass and Velocity**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Radial Velocity Ratio:**\n    The radial velocity K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift Δλ (since K = c * Δλ / λ_0, where c and λ_0 are constants).\n    Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n    K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**7. Substitute the Ratios and Calculate**\n\nNow, plug these ratios back into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\na_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, calculate the temperature ratio using the result from Step 3:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nNow, we compute the final numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes\n# a2_over_a1 = (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K_1/K_2)^2\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = 5 / 7\nrv_ratio_1_over_2 = 3 / 4\n\na2_over_a1 = (mass_ratio_2_over_1**2) * (rv_ratio_1_over_2**2)\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the square root of a2_over_a1\ntemp_ratio_1_over_2 = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(temp_ratio_1_over_2)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields approximately 0.5357. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>",
