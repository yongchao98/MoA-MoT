    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the System and Principles\n\n*   **Particles:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. \"Identical\" means they are indistinguishable. \"Spin-1/2\" means they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, these particles must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for \"spin up\" or -1/2 for \"spin down\").\n*   **Consequence:** For each energy level `n`, there are two distinct quantum states: (n, spin up) and (n, spin down). Therefore, each energy level `n` can be occupied by a maximum of two particles, and they must have opposite spins.\n*   **Energy Levels of the Well:** For a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L`, the allowed energy levels are given by:\n    `E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)` where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem conveniently defines a base unit of energy `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`. So, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n    `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the System Energies\n\nWe need to find the total energy of the system for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state by placing the four particles into the single-particle energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n#### Ground State Energy (E_ground)\n\nTo find the ground state, we must fill the available energy levels from the bottom up to achieve the minimum possible total energy.\n*   The lowest energy level is `n=1` (`E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`). It can hold two particles (one spin up, one spin down). We place our first two particles here.\n    *   Energy contribution from these two particles = `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1E) = 2E`.\n*   The next lowest energy level is `n=2` (`E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`). It can also hold two particles. We place the remaining two particles here.\n    *   Energy contribution from these two particles = `2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E`.\n*   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles.\n    *   `E_ground = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n#### First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy that is higher than the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   Ground state configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`.\n*   Highest Occupied Level: `n=2`.\n*   Lowest Unoccupied Level: `n=3`.\n*   We move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level. The new configuration is:\n    *   2 particles in `n=1` (Energy = `2 * 1E = 2E`)\n    *   1 particle in `n=2` (Energy = `1 * 4E = 4E`)\n    *   1 particle in `n=3` (Energy = `1 * E_3 = 1 * 3^2 * E = 9E`)\n*   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n    *   `E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to check the few lowest-energy possibilities for excitations from the ground state.\n*   **Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in `n=1`, 2 in `n=2`, 1 in `n=3`.\n    *   Total Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Possibility B: Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 2 in `n=3`.\n    *   Total Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n*   **Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 in `n=2`, 1 in `n=4`.\n    *   Total Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the possible energies for states above the ground state {15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...}:\n*   The ground state energy is 10E.\n*   The lowest excited state (first excited state) has energy 15E.\n*   The next lowest excited state (second excited state) has energy 18E.\n\n### Summary of Results\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThese values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
