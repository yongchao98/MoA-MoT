    "This problem asks for the uncertainty in the operator $P_z$ for a system in a given quantum state.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Quantum State:** The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The corresponding bra vector is the conjugate transpose:\n    $\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The state is normalized since $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = (-1/2)^2 + (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$.\n\n*   **Operator $P_z$:** The matrix for the operator $P_z$ is given as:\n    $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Uncertainty Formula:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$, denoted by $\\Delta A$, is defined by the formula:\n    $(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$.\n\nOur goal is to calculate $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\nThe expectation value of $P_z$ in the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nFirst, we apply the operator $P_z$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\cdot (1/\\sqrt{2}) \\\\ -\\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|(P_z|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n**3. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\nFirst, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-\\hbar)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nFirst, apply $P_z^2$ to $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\cdot (1/\\sqrt{2}) \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|(P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $\\hbar^2/2$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n\nNow we can plug our results into the uncertainty formula:\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\nTaking the square root gives the uncertainty:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nFinal answer is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
