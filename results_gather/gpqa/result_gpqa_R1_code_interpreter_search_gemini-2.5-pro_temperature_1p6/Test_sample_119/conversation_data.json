    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   `ρ = Number of Stars / Volume = Constant`\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to distance:** Let's consider the number of stars within a certain volume of space. It's easiest to work with spherical shells centered on the observer (Earth).\n    *   The volume of a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd` is given by its surface area times its thickness: `dV = 4πd² dd`.\n    *   The number of stars, `dN`, within this thin shell is the density `ρ` multiplied by the volume of the shell `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n3.  **Establish the relationship between distance and parallax:** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star.\n    *   `plx = 1/d` (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    *   This means we can also write the distance as `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Transform the relationship to be in terms of parallax:** The goal is to find how the number of stars `dN` changes with a small range of parallax `d(plx)`, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. To do this, we need to express all the variables in our `dN` equation in terms of `plx`.\n    *   We have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We also need to relate the small range of distance `dd` to the small range of parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d(d)/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   Therefore, `dd = (-1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   When we are counting stars, we are concerned with the magnitude of the range, not the direction. The negative sign just indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. So, we can use the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute the parallax expressions into the number of stars equation:** Now, we replace `d` and `dd` in the equation `dN = ρ * 4πd² dd` with their parallax equivalents.\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is precisely the term `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing both sides of the equation by `d(plx)`:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Determine the proportionality:** Since `4`, `π`, and the stellar density `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality relationship:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse of the parallax to the fourth power.\n\n<<<C>>>"
