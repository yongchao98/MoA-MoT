    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible constitutional isomers, known as tautomers. The most common form is **keto-enol tautomerism**, which requires the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen** (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4). Let's examine the carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups. These are the carbons involved in the C=C double bonds. They are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, keto-enol tautomerism cannot occur. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This structure consists of a saturated six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these alpha-carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning it has two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows this compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists in equilibrium with its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. Let's analyze the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n        *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n        *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   Group 3: -CH₃ (methyl)\n        *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        Since this carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the double bond. This molecule contains a double bond, not a carbon with four single bonds that could be a chiral center. Furthermore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. It is an achiral molecule. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
