    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis is a cyclohexanone derivative.\n*   The ring has a ketone group (=O) at position C1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is at position C3.\n*   An isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is at position C5.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n\n*   **Reagent 1: Sodium Hydride (NaH)**. NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The starting material has a hydroxyl proton (-OH) and α-protons to the ketone. The hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻ Na⁺).\n*   **Reagent 2: Benzyl Bromide (BnBr or C6H5CH2Br)**. This is an electrophilic alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The nucleophilic alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. The -CH2OH group is converted into a benzyl ether, -CH2-O-CH2-C6H5 (abbreviated as -CH2OBn). This step serves to protect the alcohol functional group from the strong base used in a later step.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Product 1 contains a ketone. p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is a hydrazine derivative.\n*   **Reaction:** Ketones react with hydrazines under acidic catalysis to form hydrazones. The nitrogen of the primary amine (-NH2) in TsNHNH2 attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated to form a C=N bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (=N-NH-Ts).\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Product 2 is a tosylhydrazone. n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong organometallic base.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    1.  n-BuLi is a strong enough base to remove two protons. The first proton removed is from the -NH- of the tosylhydrazone.\n    2.  A second equivalent of n-BuLi removes an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). There are two such carbons, C2 and C6. Deprotonation occurs at the less sterically hindered position, which is C6 (C2 is adjacent to the bulky -CH2OBn group at C3).\n    3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as p-toluenesulfinate anion, a good leaving group). This generates a vinyllithium intermediate, with a double bond between C1 and C6 and a lithium atom on C1.\n    4.  **Workup:** The final addition of aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), a mild proton source, quenches the vinyllithium intermediate by protonating C1.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The ketone is effectively reduced to an alkene, with the double bond formed at the less substituted side.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Treatment of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Product 3 contains two carbon-carbon double bonds (one in the cyclohexene ring and one in the isopropenyl side chain) and a benzyl ether. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas is a standard catalyst system for hydrogenation.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, which will reduce several functional groups:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, making the ring a cyclohexane.\n    2.  **Alkene Reduction:** The C=C double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (-C(CH3)=CH2) is reduced to a C-C single bond, converting it to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H2/Pd-C is a standard and very effective method for cleaving benzyl ethers (debenzylation). The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken, and the group is converted back to an alcohol (-OH). Toluene is formed as a byproduct. This step serves to remove the protecting group installed in Step 1.\n*   **Product 4:** All reductions occur. The product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative positions of these groups are 1,3 on the ring (derived from the original C3 and C5 positions). The IUPAC name for this structure would prioritize the alcohol function. The carbon bearing the -CH2OH group would be C1, making the isopropyl group at C3. The name is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's trace the transformations and compare with the given options:\n*   Starting Material: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropenylcyclohexanone\n*   Product 1: 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-isopropenylcyclohexanone\n*   Product 2: Tosylhydrazone of Product 1\n*   Product 3: 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-isopropenylcyclohexene\n*   Product 4: (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nNow checking the options:\nA) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Results from an incorrect reaction pathway (addition of butyl, not Shapiro elimination).\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This is the final product after hydrogenation of both alkenes and hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\nC) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved (incomplete reaction). Given the standard conditions (H2/Pd-C), cleavage is expected.\nD) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The Shapiro reaction (Step 3) was not performed.\n\nTherefore, the final structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
