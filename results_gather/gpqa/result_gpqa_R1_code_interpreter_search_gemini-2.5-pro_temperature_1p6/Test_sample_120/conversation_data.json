    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Starting Material\n\n*   **Name:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Structure:** This name describes an epoxide fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n    *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` indicates a six-membered ring fused to a three-membered ring.\n    *   `7-oxa` means atom 7, the single-atom bridge, is an oxygen. This makes the structure a cyclohexene oxide. The epoxide is formed across the C1-C6 bond.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The prefixes (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S) define the absolute configuration at these four chiral centers.\n\nLet's visualize the molecule. It's best to draw it in a 2D projection with wedges and dashes to represent its 3D structure. By convention for fused ring systems like this (formed from epoxidation of a cyclohexene), the epoxide ring is formed on one face of the molecule, which we'll assume is the \"up\" (wedge) face.\n\n*   **Epoxide:** The C1-O and C6-O bonds are pointing up (wedge).\n*   **C1 configuration (1R):** C1 is attached to the epoxide Oxygen (up), a Methyl group, C2, and C6. To satisfy the R configuration, the methyl group must be pointing down (dash), trans to the epoxide ring.\n    *   Priorities: O(1) > C6(2) > C2(3) > Me(4). Path 1->2->3 is clockwise. With Me(4) in the back (dash), the configuration is R.\n*   **C6 configuration (6S):** C6 is attached to the epoxide Oxygen (up), a Hydrogen atom, C1, and C5. To satisfy the S configuration, the Hydrogen must be pointing up (wedge), cis to the epoxide ring.\n    *   Priorities: O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). Path 1->2->3 is clockwise. With H(4) in the front (wedge), the configuration is S.\n*   **C3 configuration (3R):** C3 has a methyl group. To be R, the methyl group must be down (dash).\n    *   Priorities: C4(1) > C2(2) > Me(3) > H(4). Assume H is up (wedge). Path 1->2->3 is counter-clockwise. With H(4) in front, the configuration is R.\n*   **C4 configuration (4R):** C4 has a methyl group. To be R, the methyl group must be up (wedge).\n    *   Priorities: C3(1) > C5(2) > Me(3) > H(4). Assume H is down (dash). Path 1->2->3 is clockwise. With H(4) in back, the configuration is R.\n\nSummary of the starting material's stereochemistry in a flat projection:\n*   Epoxide: up (wedge)\n*   C1-Me: down (dash)\n*   C6-H: up (wedge)\n*   C3-Me: down (dash)\n*   C4-Me: up (wedge)\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). This provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that organocuprates attack the *less hindered* carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   C1 is a *quaternary* carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a *tertiary* carbon (bonded to C1, C5, O, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Clearly, **C6 is the less hindered carbon** and will be the site of nucleophilic attack.\n*   **Stereospecificity:** The attack occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which results in *inversion of configuration* at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide is \"up\" (wedge), the methyl group will attack from \"down\" (dash).\n\n### 3. Determine the Product Structure\n\n1.  **Attack:** The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6 from the \"down\" side.\n2.  **Bond Breaking:** The C6-O bond breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide intermediate (O⁻).\n3.  **Inversion:** The configuration at C6 inverts. The original configuration was S, so the new configuration at this carbon will be R. The incoming methyl group will be \"down\" (dash), and the hydrogen that was \"up\" (wedge) remains \"up\" (wedge).\n4.  **Workup:** An acidic or aqueous workup protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. The stereochemistry at C1 is unchanged, and the OH group will be \"up\" (wedge), where the epoxide oxygen was.\n5.  **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations remain R.\n\n### 4. Name the Product\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexanol. We need to name it according to IUPAC rules.\n\n*   **Parent:** The principal functional group is the alcohol, so it's a cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n*   **Numbering:** We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Clockwise numbering from C1: The methyl groups are at C1, C2 (the old C6), C4 (the old C4), and C5 (the old C3). The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Counter-clockwise numbering from C1: The methyl groups are at C1, C3 (the old C3), C4 (the old C4), and C6 (the old C6). The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   Comparing the sets {1,2,4,5} and {1,3,4,6}, the first set is lower at the first point of difference (2 vs 3). So, the correct numbering is clockwise.\n*   **Base Name:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This matches options A and B.\n\n### 5. Determine the Product Stereochemistry\n\nNow we determine the R/S configuration for each stereocenter in the product using the new numbering.\n\n*   **new C1 (old C1):** The reaction did not occur at this center. Its configuration remains **R**. (A change in substituent priorities could theoretically flip the R/S designator, but in this case, a careful check shows the priority order of the four attached groups does not change. So, R stays R).\n*   **new C2 (old C6):** This was the site of the Sₙ2 attack. Its configuration inverts from S to **R**.\n*   **new C4 (old C4):** This center was not involved in the reaction. Its configuration remains **R**.\n*   **new C5 (old C3):** This center was not involved in the reaction. Its configuration remains **R**.\n\nTherefore, the absolute configuration of the product is (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
