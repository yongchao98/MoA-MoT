    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a ¹H NMR spectrum with a single peak at 7 ppm and a ¹³C NMR spectrum with two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single peak in the ¹H NMR at 7 ppm (vinylic region) implies two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond.\n        *   Two peaks in the ¹³C NMR (137 ppm for C=C, 165 ppm for C=O) confirm the symmetry, with two equivalent vinylic carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid).\n        *   Maleic anhydride formula: C₄H₂O₃.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring where all four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) are substituted with methyl groups. The remaining carbon (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n        *   Diene formula: C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   **Product Formula:** C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) → C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the molecular formula given for the products.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n        *   The **endo rule** predicts that the kinetic product (usually the major product formed at lower temperatures) is the *endo* adduct. This stereoisomer is favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the diene and the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile.\n        *   The **exo adduct** is typically the more thermodynamically stable product but is formed more slowly (the minor product under kinetic control).\n        *   Therefore, we can confidently assign the **major product as the *endo* adduct** and the **minor product as the *exo* adduct**.\n\n3.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n    *   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Due to a plane of symmetry passing through the C7 bridge and bisecting the C2=C3 and C5-C6 bonds, several groups of protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   Let's analyze the expected signals and assign them to the shifts given in the options:\n        *   **Protons from the anhydride (H_A):** There are two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are on carbons adjacent to a bridgehead and alpha to a carbonyl. A chemical shift around **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable. They are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a **2H singlet**. This matches parts of options C and D.\n        *   **Methyl groups:** There are two sets of methyl groups.\n            *   **Vinylic methyls (Me_vinyl):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (at C2 and C3). Vinylic methyls typically appear around 1.7-2.0 ppm. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** in options B and C.\n            *   **Bridgehead methyls (Me_bridgehead):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These are tertiary alkyl methyls and should be more shielded (at a lower ppm) than the vinylic methyls. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm** in options A and B.\n        *   **Methylene bridge protons (C7):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent). One points *syn* (towards the C=C double bond) and the other points *anti* (away from the C=C double bond). They would typically appear as two distinct signals, likely a pair of doublets due to geminal coupling. The option mentions a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. We can assign this to one of the bridge protons, most likely the *anti* proton (H_anti), which is generally more shielded in this type of system.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Cross-Peak**\n    *   A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find this unique spatial relationship.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):**\n        *   The anhydride ring is tucked *under* the main bicyclic framework, on the opposite side of the C7 bridge.\n        *   The protons from the anhydride (H_A, ~3.5 ppm) are pointing \"downwards\".\n        *   The *anti* proton on the C7 bridge (H_anti, which we assigned to ~1.5 ppm) is also pointing \"downwards\".\n        *   Therefore, H_A and H_anti are close in space. **An NOE cross-peak between H_A (~3.5 ppm) and H_anti (~1.5 ppm) is expected.**\n        *   Conversely, H_A is far from the vinylic methyls (Me_vinyl).\n\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):**\n        *   The anhydride ring is positioned *above* the main framework, on the same side as the C7 bridge.\n        *   The protons H_A (~3.5 ppm) are pointing \"upwards\".\n        *   The *anti* proton H_anti (~1.5 ppm) is pointing \"downwards\".\n        *   Therefore, H_A and H_anti are far apart. **The NOE cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.**\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The NOE cross-peak between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the *anti*-bridge proton (H_anti) is a unique feature of the *endo* (major) product. This corresponds to an interaction between:\n    *   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_A)\n    *   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H_anti)\n\n    This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
