As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the phenotypes of the single mutants:**\n    *   Wild-type (WT) has 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n    *   `g1` mutant has 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function causes a partial (25%) loss of resistance.\n    *   `g2` mutant has 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function causes a complete loss of resistance. This means G2 is an essential gene for this trait.\n    *   `g3` mutant has 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function causes a significant (50%) loss of resistance.\n\n2.  **Analyze the phenotypes of the double mutants to determine epistasis:**\n    *   **Epistasis** is a genetic interaction where the effect of one gene masks the effect of another. If a double mutant `ab` shows the same phenotype as a single mutant `a`, we say that gene `a` is epistatic to gene `b`.\n    *   `g1g2` double mutant: Resistance is 0%. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g1` single mutant (75%). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   `g2g3` double mutant: Resistance is 0%. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g3` single mutant (50%). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\n3.  **Interpret the role of G2:**\n    *   We know from the problem description that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of others.\n    *   Since the `g2` mutation masks the effects of both `g1` and `g3` mutations, G2 is likely in the same biological pathway as G1 and G3.\n    *   The epistatic gene is typically the one that acts upstream in a regulatory pathway or downstream in a metabolic pathway. Given the prompt about an upstream TF, the most logical model is that G2 is a transcription factor required to activate the expression of both G1 and G3.\n    *   Pathway model: G2 --(activates)--> G1 and G3 --(contribute to)--> Resistance.\n    *   This model fits the data: If G2 is knocked out (`g2` mutant), G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance, which is what we observe. This also explains why the `g1g2` and `g2g3` mutants look identical to the `g2` mutant.\n\n4.  **Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    *   `g1` single mutant loses 25% resistance.\n    *   `g3` single mutant loses 50% resistance.\n    *   If their effects were purely additive and independent, the double mutant `g1g3` would be expected to lose 25% + 50% = 75% resistance, resulting in 25% resistance.\n    *   However, the `g1g3` double mutant has only 10% resistance, meaning a 90% loss.\n    *   This much stronger effect in the double mutant compared to the sum of the single mutants is a classic example of a synergistic interaction, also known as **gene redundancy** (in this case, partial redundancy). It implies that G1 and G3 function in parallel or have overlapping roles, and the organism can compensate for the loss of one but not both.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options based on the conclusions:**\n    *   **Conclusion 1: G2 is a transcription factor.** This is supported by the epistasis data. Options A, B, and D include this. Option C claims G1 is the TF, which is incorrect because the `g1` mutant has a milder phenotype than the `g2` mutant. So, C is wrong.\n    *   **Conclusion 2: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.** This is supported by the synergistic effect seen in the `g1g3` double mutant. Only option D mentions \"gene redundancy\". Option A mentions \"pleiotropy\", for which we have no evidence as only one trait was measured.\n    *   **Conclusion 3: Check for epistasis between G1 and G3.** The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%) or the `g3` phenotype (50%). Therefore, neither G1 nor G3 is epistatic to the other in the classical sense. Options A, B, and D all make a claim about epistasis between G1 and G3, and these claims are technically incorrect based on the data.\n    *   **Overall Comparison:**\n        *   A) G2 is TF (Correct), Pleiotropy (No evidence), G1 epistatic to G3 (Incorrect).\n        *   B) G2 is TF (Correct), Same promoter (No evidence), G3 epistatic to G1 (Incorrect).\n        *   C) G1 is TF (Incorrect).\n        *   D) **G2 is a transcription factor (Correct)**, **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (Correct)**, G1 is epistatic towards G3 (Incorrect).\n\n    *   Option D has two strongly supported conclusions drawn directly from the data, whereas the other options have only one correct conclusion and another that is either incorrect or cannot be determined. Despite the error in its third clause (likely a mistake in the question itself), option D provides the most accurate overall description of the genetic interactions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
