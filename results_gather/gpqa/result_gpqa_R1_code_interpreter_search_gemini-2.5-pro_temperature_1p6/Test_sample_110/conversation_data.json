    "*   **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n    1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate will then act as a nucleophile and attack the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n\n    2.  **Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons, C2 and C6.\n        *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has no α-protons.\n        *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group) and has one α-proton.\n        Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only deprotonate the ketone at the C6 position to form the enolate.\n\n         \n\n    3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion at C6 is nucleophilic and attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n\n         \n\n    4.  **Product A Structure and Naming:** After the attack, the intermediate enolate is protonated (by abstracting a proton from t-butanol, formed in the first step), yielding the final product. The product has the ethyl acrylate chain attached to C6 of the original cyclohexanone.\n        *   Let's analyze the structure of the product: It's a cyclohexanone ring with a C=O at C1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, a methyl group at C6, and a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` chain also at C6.\n        *   To match the IUPAC names given in the options, we need to name this compound as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. In this naming system, the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent.\n        *   The propanoate chain is attached to the ring. We designate the attachment carbon on the ring as C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, we number the ring such that the ketone's carbonyl group gets the next lowest number. This means numbering towards the most substituted side.\n        *   The new numbering is:\n            *   C1: The carbon where the propanoate chain is attached (originally C6). It also has a methyl group.\n            *   C2: The carbonyl carbon (originally C1). It is an \"oxo\" group.\n            *   C3: The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (originally C2).\n        *   Following this numbering, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n        *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name given in options C and D.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH**\n\n    1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction. The protons on the α-carbon of a nitroalkane are acidic (pKa ≈ 10) and can be removed by a strong base like KOH. The resulting nitronate anion is a good nucleophile.\n\n    2.  **Nitronate Formation:** KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form the nitronate anion: CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂.\n\n    3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n        *   Nucleophile: CH₃CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂\n        *   Michael Acceptor: CH₃-C(β)H=C(α)H-CN\n        *   The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n\n         \n\n    4.  **Product B Structure and Naming:** An intermediate carbanion is formed at the α-position of the nitrile, which is then protonated by water in the reaction mixture.\n        *   The resulting product is: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n        *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. The chain is 6 carbons long (`NC-C-C-C-C-C`). So, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon (C1).\n            *   `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n        *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n        *   The full IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given in options A and C.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Product A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n    *   Product B is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n    *   Both of these correct products are listed in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
