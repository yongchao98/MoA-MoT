    "This is a problem about radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key property of the exponential distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an event happening in the future does not depend on how much time has already passed.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the decay process:** The probability of a single atom *not* decaying (surviving) up to a time `t` is given by the formula P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. The probability of it decaying within time `t` is 1 - P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).\n\n2.  **Calculate the decay constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find λ.\n    *   P(decay in 100 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n    *   This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is: e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n3.  **Formulate the question:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   Let T be the time of decay. We want to find the conditional probability: P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50).\n    *   This is P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50).\n\n4.  **Apply the memoryless property:** Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its future decay probability. The probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in any 150-minute interval.\n    *   Therefore, we just need to calculate the probability of decay within 150 minutes: P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n\n5.  **Calculate the final probability:** We need to find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)`. We can use the information from step 2.\n    *   From step 2, we know: e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n    *   We can rewrite this as: (e^(-λ))^100 = 0.68\n    *   Taking the 100th root of both sides: e^(-λ) = 0.68^(1/100)\n    *   Now substitute this into the expression for the probability of survival for 150 minutes:\n        e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ))^150 = (0.68^(1/100))^150\n    *   Using the rule of exponents (x^a)^b = x^(a*b):\n        e^(-λ * 150) = 0.68^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5\n    *   This is the probability the atom *survives* for 150 minutes.\n\n6.  **Compute the decay probability:** The probability of decay is 1 minus the probability of survival.\n    *   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (probability of survival for 150 min)\n    *   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\nWe can calculate this value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the probability of survival for 150 minutes\nprob_survival_150_min = 0.68**1.5\n\n# The probability of decay is 1 minus the probability of survival\nprob_decay_150_min = 1 - prob_survival_150_min\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"The probability of decay is: {prob_decay_150_min * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\nThe result of the calculation `1 - 0.68**1.5` is approximately 0.441.\n0.441 corresponds to 44.1%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem deals with radioactive decay, which is characterized by the exponential distribution. A fundamental feature of this distribution is its \"memoryless\" property. This means the probability of an event (in this case, decay) occurring in the future is independent of how long we have already been waiting.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Model the decay process:** The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability that it decays within time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the given information to find the decay constant (λ):** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   From this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n    *   `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Apply the memoryless property:** The question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. Because decay is a memoryless process, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant to the future probability.\n    *   Therefore, the problem reduces to simply finding the probability that a new atom would decay within a 150-minute interval.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes:** We need to calculate `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` from the survival probability we found in step 2:\n    *   We know `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   Let's find the base of the exponent, `e^(-λ)`: `e^(-λ) = (0.68)^(1/100)`.\n    *   Now we can calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes, `S(150)`:\n    *   `S(150) = e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ))^150 = ((0.68)^(1/100))^150`\n    *   `S(150) = (0.68)^(150/100) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Compute the final value:**\n    *   The probability of survival for 150 minutes is `S(150) = 0.68^1.5`.\n    *   The probability of decay within 150 minutes is `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n\nThe Python code calculated this value:\n`1 - 0.68**1.5 ≈ 0.4393`\n\nThis probability, `0.4393`, is equivalent to `43.93%`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 52%\nB) 48%\nC) 44%\nD) 40%\n\nThe closest answer is 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
