    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The position is consistent with the C=O of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of a broad O-H peak, a C=O peak, and a C=C peak strongly suggests that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly bonded to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The observation of these peaks in the NMR spectrum confirms the presence of the alkene group, which was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group itself, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass of C = 12\n    *   Mass of O = 16\n    *   Mass of H = 1\n    *   Total mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45\n*   The presence of this fragment provides strong confirmation for the carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Molecular Formula Options**\n\n*   **Requirement for Oxygen:** Since the compound is a carboxylic acid (-COOH), it must contain **two** oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C) C6H10O and D) C6H12O. We are left with A) C6H10O2 and B) C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Requirement for Unsaturation:** The FTIR and NMR data confirm the presence of a C=C double bond in addition to the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid. This means the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O, and one for the C=C).\n\n*   **Calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU formula for a compound CₓHᵧO₂ is: `DoU = x - y/2 + 1`\n\n    *   **For B) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n        A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid. This formula represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) and would not have a C=C bond. This contradicts the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n    *   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n        A DoU of 2 accounts for both the C=O double bond and the C=C double bond. This is perfectly consistent with all the provided spectral data for an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the combined evidence from FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry, the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the chemical formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
