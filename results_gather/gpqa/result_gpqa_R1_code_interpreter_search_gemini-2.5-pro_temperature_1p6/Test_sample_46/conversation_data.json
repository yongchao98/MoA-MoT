    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   The remaining degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) typically corresponds to a double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a primary amide would also have two bands but its C=O stretch would be different.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch of an ester group (~1715-1735 cm-1). An amide C=O stretch (Amide I band) would appear at a lower frequency (typically 1650-1690 cm-1). This strongly suggests the presence of an ester, not an amide.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and an ester group (-COO-).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), as indicated by the triplet splitting (n+1=3, so n=2). This is part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3), as indicated by the quartet splitting (n+1=4, so n=3). The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, specifically an ester oxygen (-O-CH2-). Together with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl: -CO-O-CH2CH3 (an ethyl ester).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to quadropolar relaxation from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid/water.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are electronically different. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to protons ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOR). The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to protons ortho to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH2).\n\n*   **Structure Determination and Evaluation of Options**\n    *   The spectroscopic data consistently points to a structure containing a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   Assembling these pieces leads to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n    *   Let's verify this against the options:\n        *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: formula C9H11NO2, IR bands for -NH2 and ester C=O, and all 1H NMR signals (para-substituted ring, ethyl ester, and primary amine).\n        *   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. The IR would show one N-H peak and an amide C=O peak (~1670 cm-1), which contradicts the data.\n        *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, so the C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm-1). Also, it is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets.\n        *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer of A. Here, the ester linkage is Ar-O-CO-R. The propionate group would show a quartet around 2.5 ppm (-CO-CH2-) and a triplet. The given spectrum shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which can only be from an -O-CH2- group, as in an ethyl ester.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the provided data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
