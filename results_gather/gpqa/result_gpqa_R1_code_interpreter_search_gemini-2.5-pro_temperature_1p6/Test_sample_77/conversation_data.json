    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) produced by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's break down the problem and derive the solution.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   **Point charge:** We have a single charge `q`.\n*   **Motion:** The charge follows a trajectory `s(t)`. Its velocity at any time `t` is `v(t) = d s(t) / dt`.\n*   **Observer:** The potentials are measured at a position `r` and time `t`.\n*   **Retardation:** Electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light `c`. The field measured at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier position `s(tr)` and an earlier time `tr`, called the **retarded time**.\n*   **Retarded Time Condition:** The time difference `t - tr` must be equal to the time it takes for light to travel from the source `s(tr)` to the observer `r`.\n    *   Distance = `|r - s(tr)|`\n    *   Time = Distance / `c`\n    *   Therefore, `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n### 2. Defining the Key Vectors\n\nThe problem defines these vectors, which are standard in the derivation of Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n\n*   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `v = v(tr)`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `d = r - s(tr)`: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`: The magnitude of this vector, which is the distance the field has traveled.\n\nUsing these definitions, the retarded time condition can be written as:\n`c(t - tr) = d`\n\n### 3. Deriving the Potentials\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a point charge. The standard, general solutions for potentials are the \"retarded potentials\":\n\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nFor a point charge `q` at position `s(t')`, the charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are:\n\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n*   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time `tr` inside the integrand also depends on the integration variable `r'`. Performing the integration correctly (which involves a change of variables and calculating a Jacobian) yields a specific correction factor in the denominator.\n\nThe result of this integration is:\n\n`∫ [ ... / |r - r'| ] d³r' = [ ... / ( |r - s(tr)| - (r - s(tr)) ⋅ v(tr) / c ) ]`\n\nApplying this result to our case:\n\n#### Scalar Potential (V)\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [ q / ( |r - s(tr)| - (r - s(tr)) ⋅ v(tr) / c ) ]`\n\nNow, let's substitute our defined vectors `d` and `v`:\n\n*   `|r - s(tr)| = d`\n*   `r - s(tr) = d`\n*   `v(tr) = v`\n\nSo, `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [ q / (d - d ⋅ v / c) ]`\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [ qc / (dc - d ⋅ v) ]`\n`V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n#### Vector Potential (A)\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential:\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [ q * v(tr) / ( |r - s(tr)| - (r - s(tr)) ⋅ v(tr) / c ) ]`\n\nSubstituting `d` and `v`:\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [ qv / (d - d ⋅ v / c) ]`\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [ qcv / (dc - d ⋅ v) ]`\n`A(r, t) = μ₀qcv / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n### 4. Comparing with Options\n\nLet's check the given options against our derived expressions.\n\n*   **V(r,t) = `qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`**\n*   **A(r,t) = `μ₀qcv / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`**\n\n*   **A) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(r,t) = v/c² V(r,t)`**: Incorrect. This is the static potential, not for a moving charge.\n*   **B) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`, `A(r,t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (d c - d ⋅ v))`**: This matches our derived expressions perfectly.\n*   **C) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(r,t) = v²/c² V(r,t)`**: Incorrect potential and incorrect relation for A.\n*   **D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d ⋅ v))`, `A(r,t) = (μ qc v) / (4π (d c + d ⋅ v))`**: Incorrect sign in the denominator. The sign must be negative.\n\nThe correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in option B.\n\nAs a final check, we can verify the relationship between `A` and `V`.\n`A/V = [μ₀qcv / (4π (dc - d⋅v))] / [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d⋅v))]`\n`A/V = (μ₀ / 4π) * (4πε₀) * v = μ₀ε₀ v`\nSince `c² = 1 / (μ₀ε₀)`, it follows that `μ₀ε₀ = 1/c²`.\nTherefore, `A/V = v / c²`, or `A = (v / c²) V`.\nThe potentials in option B satisfy this relationship, providing further confirmation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
