    "Here is my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the user's prompt into individual chemical clues to identify the unknown substances (X, Y, W, G, B).\n\n2.  **Clue 1: Melting Point of B.** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   I'll convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   However, it is very close to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a strong indication that **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n3.  **Clue 2: Substance X and its Isotope.** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"\n    *   Since we've identified D₂O (heavy water), it's highly probable that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned is Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen (H).\n    *   Therefore, Substance X must contain Deuterium.\n\n4.  **Clue 3: Gas W.** \"...release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"\n    *   The reaction involves deuterated compounds. A very likely gaseous product is Deuterium gas, D₂.\n    *   Let's check its composition:\n        *   A Deuterium (D or ²H) atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n        *   A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n        *   The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This fits the clue perfectly.\n    *   So, it's very likely that **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n5.  **Clue 4: Substance X as a Reagent.** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   This points towards a common reducing agent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is an extremely common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n    *   Its \"very close analog\" that incorporates a \"heavier isotope\" (Deuterium) would be Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis (X = LiAlD₄) with the keto acid clue. A keto acid has the structure R-C(=O)-COOH. It has both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reagent to reduce *both* of these functional groups to alcohols.\n    *   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ → (followed by workup) → R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH) (with deuterium incorporated at specific sites). The final product is a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   This confirms that **Substance X is very likely LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Clue 5: The Violent Reaction.** \"Substance X...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"\n    *   We have identified: X = LiAlD₄, W = D₂, B = D₂O. Let's see if we can find a liquid Y that makes the reaction work.\n    *   LiAlH₄ is known to react violently with water. Similarly, LiAlD₄ would react violently with water or heavy water.\n    *   Let's assume Y is heavy water (D₂O), since that fits the isotopic context.\n    *   The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   Let's check if this matches the clues:\n        *   **Violent reaction?** Yes.\n        *   **Releases gas W (D₂)?** Yes, it produces 4 molecules of D₂.\n        *   **Forms a precipitate G?** Yes, Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide) is the analog of Al(OH)₃, which is a precipitate. So **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n        *   **G, when heated, releases B (D₂O)?** The decomposition of a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) typically yields the metal oxide and water (or heavy water). 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O (Substance B).\n    *   All clues align perfectly. The identification of **X as LiAlD₄** is solid.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The note clarifies to sum the masses of *all atoms* of these elements.\n    *   Substance X = **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   We need their atomic masses (mass numbers for the specific isotopes):\n        *   Deuterium (D or ²H): Mass number = 2\n        *   Lithium (⁷Li, the most common isotope): Mass number = 7\n        *   Aluminum (²⁷Al, the only stable isotope): Mass number = 27\n    *   Ranking the elements by mass: D (2) < Li (7) < Al (27).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al).\n    *   Calculate the total mass contributed by all atoms of the lightest element: There are four D atoms. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Calculate the total mass contributed by all atoms of the heaviest element: There is one Al atom. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Calculate the cumulative (summed) mass: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nI will use a short Python script to confirm this simple arithmetic.\n```python\n# The identified substance X is LiAlD4.\n# We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n# The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n# We use the mass numbers of the relevant isotopes.\nmass_D = 2  # Deuterium is 2H\nmass_Li = 7  # Most common isotope of Lithium is 7Li\nmass_Al = 27 # Only stable isotope of Aluminum is 27Al\n\n# The lightest element is Deuterium (mass=2).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminum (mass=27).\n\n# The formula is LiAlD4.\n# There is 1 atom of Al and 4 atoms of D.\n\n# Cumulative mass of the lightest element's atoms (4 * Deuterium):\ntotal_mass_lightest = 4 * mass_D\n\n# Cumulative mass of the heaviest element's atoms (1 * Aluminum):\ntotal_mass_heaviest = 1 * mass_Al\n\n# The final sum is:\nfinal_answer = total_mass_lightest + total_mass_heaviest\nprint(final_answer)\n```\n>>>\n35\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I will break down the problem statement into individual chemical clues to identify the unknown substances, especially Substance X.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance B:** The first key clue is \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   However, the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is a very close match.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Isotope in Substance X:** The prompt states, \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\" Since we've identified D₂O, the heavier isotope is almost certainly Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen. This means Substance X contains Deuterium.\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W:** The reaction releases \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Let's consider the deuterated analog of hydrogen gas, which is Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single Deuterium atom (²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A molecule of D₂ therefore contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n5.  **Identify Substance X:** The prompt gives several clues about X:\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common reagent.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. A reagent that reduces both of these would produce a diol (a molecule with two alcohol, -OH, groups), which contains 2 oxygen atoms. A very powerful reducing agent is needed for this.\n    *   Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous, powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry that fits this description. Its \"very close analog\" containing the heavy isotope (Deuterium) would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Verify the Reaction:** The prompt describes the reaction: \"Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"\n    *   Let's assume our identifications are correct: X = LiAlD₄, Y = D₂O (heavy water is a plausible \"liquid Y\" in this context), W = D₂, G = Precipitate, B = D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction is known to be **violent**. It releases **D₂ gas (W)**. It forms **Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a precipitate (G)**.\n    *   When the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases **D₂O (B)**.\n    *   All clues align, confirming that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** The question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   We use the mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved:\n        *   Deuterium (D, or ²H): Mass number = 2\n        *   Lithium (Li, most common isotope ⁷Li): Mass number = 7\n        *   Aluminum (Al, only stable isotope ²⁷Al): Mass number = 27\n    *   The **lightest** element is Deuterium (mass 2).\n    *   The **heaviest** element is Aluminum (mass 27).\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains **four** atoms of the lightest element (D) and **one** atom of the heaviest element (Al).\n    *   Sum the mass of all atoms of the lightest element: 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Sum the mass of all atoms of the heaviest element: 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (total) mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option B. The calculation can be confirmed with a simple script.\n\n```python\n# The identified substance X is LiAlD4.\n# The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n# The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n# We use the integer mass numbers of the relevant isotopes.\nmass_D = 2      # Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen, 2H\nmass_Li = 7     # The most common isotope of Lithium is 7Li\nmass_Al = 27    # The only stable isotope of Aluminum is 27Al\n\n# In the molecule LiAlD4:\n# Lightest element: Deuterium (mass = 2)\n# Heaviest element: Aluminum (mass = 27)\n\n# Number of atoms of the lightest element (D) is 4.\n# Number of atoms of the heaviest element (Al) is 1.\n\n# Cumulative mass of the lightest element's atoms:\ntotal_mass_of_D = 4 * mass_D\n\n# Cumulative mass of the heaviest element's atoms:\ntotal_mass_of_Al = 1 * mass_Al\n\n# The final answer is the sum of these two cumulative masses.\nfinal_answer = total_mass_of_D + total_mass_of_Al\n\nprint(final_answer)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
