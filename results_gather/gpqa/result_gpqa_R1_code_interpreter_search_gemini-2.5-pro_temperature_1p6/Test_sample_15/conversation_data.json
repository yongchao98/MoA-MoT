    "This problem asks us to determine the number of optically active compounds from a given list. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (such molecules are called meso compounds).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   The atoms of the double bond (C1 and C2) are sp2 hybridized and planar. A stereocenter is typically an sp3 hybridized carbon bonded to four different groups.\n    *   This molecule has no chiral centers.\n    *   It does not possess any other type of chirality like axial or planar chirality.\n    *   The molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex molecule, but we don't need to draw its exact structure to determine its optical activity.\n    *   The name includes stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS,E)`. The `R` and `S` designators indicate the absolute configuration at specific chiral centers (3a and 7a). The `E` designator refers to the stereochemistry of the double bond.\n    *   When a compound's name specifies a single set of absolute configurations (e.g., R, S), it refers to a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer is by definition chiral.\n    *   Only in very rare and specific cases of meso compounds could an R/S notation be misleading, but standard IUPAC nomenclature for a specific enantiomer implies chirality.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 (`H`, `CH3`, `COOH`, and `CH(CH3)COOH`) are identical to the substituents on C3.\n    *   For a molecule with two identical chiral centers, the stereoisomer with an `(R,S)` configuration (or `(S,R)`) is a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Drawing the Fischer projection for (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid confirms the presence of a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n    *   Since it is a meso compound, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` forms are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at C1. C1 is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  `-OH`\n        2.  `-H`\n        3.  `-CH2-CH=` (path C1-C2-C3)\n        4.  `-CH2-CH2-CH=` (path C1-C6-C5-C4)\n    *   Since the two paths around the ring from C1 are different, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single, specific chiral molecule.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at the 1, 3, and 5 positions.\n    *   The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` refers to the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's check for chirality at C1. C1 is bonded to `H`, `OH`, and two ring segments: `-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-` and `-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-`. These two pathways are identical. Therefore, C1 is not a true chiral center (it's a pseudoasymmetric center, as indicated by the 's' notation). The same applies to C3 and C5.\n    *   This all-cis isomer is highly symmetrical. It possesses a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry (each plane passes through one `C-OH` group and the opposite `CH2` group).\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure can be determined from the IUPAC name. The parent chain is butan-1-one. A methyl group is at C3, and a cyclopentyl group is attached to C1 (the carbonyl carbon).\n    *   Structure: `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers (sp3 carbon with four different groups).\n    *   The `CH` carbon (C3 of the butane chain) is bonded to: `-H`, `-CH3` (from C4), another `-CH3` (the substituent), and `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the cyclopentyl ring, as the two paths from the point of attachment are identical.\n    *   The molecule has no other elements of chirality. It is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
