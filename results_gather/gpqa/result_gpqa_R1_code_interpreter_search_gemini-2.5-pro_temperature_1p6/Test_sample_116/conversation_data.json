    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Understanding Optical Isomerism**\nA compound shows optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are:\n1.  **Chiral Center (Stereocenter):** A carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Axial Chirality:** Chirality resulting from hindered rotation about a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (atropisomerism) or allenes.\n3.  **Planar Chirality:** Chirality arising from a plane in the molecule.\nA molecule that has a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i) is achiral and will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. Two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. There are substituents at the positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   At positions 2 and 2': methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃)\n    *   At positions 6 and 6': nitro groups (-NO₂)\n*   **Analysis:** The methoxycarbonyl and nitro groups are large and bulky. Their presence at all four ortho positions creates significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the free rotation of the two phenyl rings around the central C-C single bond. The rings are forced into a non-coplanar, twisted conformation.\n*   **Chirality:** We need to check if this stable, non-planar molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Any plane that cuts through the molecule will not have its two sides as mirror images due to the twisted nature and the substitution pattern.\n    *   The molecule also lacks a center of inversion.\n    *   Because rotation is restricted and the molecule lacks key symmetry elements (a plane of symmetry or center of inversion), it is chiral. This specific type of chirality is called atropisomerism (a form of axial chirality).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is an ester, also known as methyl lactate. Its structural formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's focus on the central carbon atom, C-2, which is bonded to the hydroxyl group (-OH). We need to identify the four groups attached to this carbon:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Chirality:** Since all four groups attached to the C-2 atom are different, this carbon is a chiral center (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes the molecule chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two enantiomers ((R)- and (S)-forms) and thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O. Two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The central carbonyl carbon is sp²-hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl rings). It cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   There are no other potential sources of chirality like axial or planar chirality.\n    *   The molecule has elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the C=O bond. More importantly, it is possible for the molecule to adopt a conformation that possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. The rotation around the C-Ph bonds is rapid at room temperature.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry (σ).\n    *   Furthermore, it has a center of inversion (i) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Inverting any atom through this point leads to an identical atom.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion means the molecule is achiral. It does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does have a geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate, but the question is about optical isomerism).\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct choice includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
