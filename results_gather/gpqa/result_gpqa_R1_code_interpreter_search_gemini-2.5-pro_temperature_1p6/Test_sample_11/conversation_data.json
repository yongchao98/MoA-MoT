    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThis problem involves a particle decay at rest. The fundamental principles we need to apply are:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** Since the particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Define the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A positive pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n    *   Rest energy of Pion, `E_pi = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`.\n    *   Since it is stationary, its kinetic energy `KE_pi` is 0, and its momentum `p_pi` is 0.\n    *   Total initial energy = `139.6 MeV`.\n    *   Total initial momentum = `0`.\n\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n    *   Rest energy of Muon, `m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV`.\n    *   For this type of problem, the neutrino (nu) is assumed to be massless, so its rest energy `m_nu * c^2` is 0.\n    *   The muon and neutrino will move off in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Let their momenta be `p_mu` and `p_nu`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   `p_initial = p_final`\n*   `0 = p_mu + p_nu` (vector sum)\n*   This implies that the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n*   `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   `E_initial = E_final`\n*   `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\nWhere `E_mu` and `E_nu` are the total energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively. We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n*   For the muon: `E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n*   For the massless neutrino: `E_nu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + 0^2) = p*c`. The kinetic energy of a massless particle is equal to its total energy, so `KE_nu = E_nu = p*c`.\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\n`m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\n**5. Solve for the Momentum (p*c)**\n\nWe need to solve the equation above for `p*c`. Let's rearrange and square both sides:\n`m_pi * c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n`(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n`(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi*c^2) * (p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nThe `(p*c)^2` terms cancel out:\n`(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 = 2 * (m_pi*c^2) * (p*c)`\n\nNow, isolate `p*c`:\n`p*c = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi*c^2) ]`\n\n**6. Calculate the Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe can now calculate the numerical values using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Rest energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate p*c using the derived formula.\n# p*c is also the kinetic energy of the massless neutrino.\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total energy released as kinetic energy is the difference in rest masses.\n# Q_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n# This energy is shared between the two product particles: Q_value = KE_mu + KE_nu\n# So, KE_mu = Q_value - KE_nu\nKE_mu = (m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2) - KE_nu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>KE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of the muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.\n\nThese values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for the solution.\n\n### **1. Principles**\n\nThe decay must obey two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay equals the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay equals the total momentum after the decay.\n\n### **2. Initial State**\n\n*   The initial particle is a positive pion (Pi+), and it is stationary.\n*   **Initial Energy (E_i):** Since it's at rest, its energy is just its rest energy.\n    *   `E_i = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n*   **Initial Momentum (p_i):** Since it's at rest, its momentum is zero.\n    *   `p_i = 0`\n\n### **3. Final State**\n\n*   The final particles are a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n*   These particles will move in opposite directions to conserve momentum.\n*   **Final Energy (E_f):** The sum of the total energies of the muon (E_mu) and the neutrino (E_nu).\n    *   `E_f = E_mu + E_nu`\n*   **Final Momentum (p_f):** The sum of the momenta of the muon (p_mu) and the neutrino (p_nu).\n    *   `p_f = p_mu + p_nu`\n\n### **4. Applying Conservation Laws**\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**\n`p_i = p_f`\n`0 = p_mu + p_nu`\nThis means the muon and neutrino fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n`|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2`, where `m_0` is the rest mass.\n\n`E_i = E_f`\n`m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n*   For the **muon (mu+)**, which has mass:\n    `E_mu = sqrt( (p * c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2 )`\n*   For the **neutrino (nu)**, which is treated as massless (`m_nu = 0`):\n    `E_nu = sqrt( (p * c)^2 + 0 ) = p * c`\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\n`m_pi * c^2 = sqrt( (p * c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2 ) + p * c`\n\n### **5. Solving for the Unknowns**\n\nOur goal is to find the kinetic energies (KE) of the product particles.\n*   KE of neutrino: Since it's massless, its kinetic energy is its total energy, `KE_nu = E_nu = p * c`.\n*   KE of muon: `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2`.\n\nLet's first solve the energy equation for `p*c`.\n1.  Rearrange the equation:\n    `m_pi * c^2 - p * c = sqrt( (p * c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2 )`\n2.  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    `(m_pi * c^2 - p * c)^2 = (p * c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n3.  Expand the left side:\n    `(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi*c^2) * (p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n4.  The `(p*c)^2` terms cancel out. Rearrange to solve for `p*c`:\n    `(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 = 2 * (m_pi*c^2) * (p*c)`\n    `p*c = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi*c^2) ]`\n\n### **6. Calculation**\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   `m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n*   `m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV`\n\n**Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_nu):**\n`KE_nu = p*c = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n`KE_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n`KE_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n`KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n**Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_mu):**\nThe total kinetic energy released in the decay is the difference in the initial and final rest energies (this is called the Q-value).\n`KE_total = m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV`\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two products:\n`KE_total = KE_mu + KE_nu`\n`KE_mu = KE_total - KE_nu`\n`KE_mu = 33.9 - 29.8`\n`KE_mu ≈ 4.1 MeV`\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are **4.1 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
