    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (C8H9NO) from the given NMR data.**\n\n    1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n        The formula for DoU is `C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`.\n        DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n    2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Signals:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates that it is coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (2 protons on CH2 + 1 = 3 peaks, a triplet).\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. The splitting is a doublet (d), confirming its coupling to the single aldehyde proton (1 proton + 1 = 2 peaks, a doublet). This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment (an acetaldehyde group attached to something).\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region, which disappears on D2O shake, is indicative of a primary amine group (-NH2).\n\n    3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n        We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with `-NH2` and `-CH2-CHO` as substituents.\n        Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (benzene ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = **C8H9NO**. This matches the given formula.\n        The starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    The starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n    1.  **Reagents: NaNO2 + HCl (0-5 °C)**\n        This is a standard **diazotization** reaction. The primary aromatic amine (`-NH2`) is converted into a diazonium salt (`-N2+Cl-`).\n        The intermediate formed is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n    2.  **Reagent: H2O**\n        The diazonium salt is then treated with water. This causes **hydrolysis**, where the diazonium group (`-N2+`) is replaced by a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), evolving nitrogen gas (N2).\n        The intermediate formed is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    3.  **Reagents: aq. KOH, Heat**\n        This represents reaction conditions for an **aldol condensation**. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has an aldehyde group and acidic protons on the alpha-carbon (the `-CH2-` group).\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** The strong base (KOH) removes an alpha-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The product would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**.\n        *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The hydroxyl group at the β-position and a proton from the α-position are eliminated, creating a double bond between the α and β carbons. This results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\n    Let's trace the atoms during the aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (let's denote the 4-hydroxyphenyl group as `Ar`):\n\n    *   Two molecules of `Ar-CH2-CHO` react.\n    *   **Aldol Addition Product:** `Ar-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ar)-CHO`\n    *   **Dehydration:** This molecule loses H2O (the -OH from C3 and the -H from C2).\n    *   **Final Condensation Product:** `Ar-CH2-CH=C(Ar)-CHO`\n\n    Let's name this final product according to IUPAC rules:\n    *   The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons, aldehyde at C1, double bond at C2).\n    *   There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group at position C2 and another at position C4.\n    *   The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n    Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the aldol addition product, which is an intermediate before the heat-induced dehydration.\n    B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure and stoichiometry.\n    C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** - This perfectly matches our derived final product from the aldol condensation.\n    D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure; the hydroxyl groups from the phenol are missing.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
