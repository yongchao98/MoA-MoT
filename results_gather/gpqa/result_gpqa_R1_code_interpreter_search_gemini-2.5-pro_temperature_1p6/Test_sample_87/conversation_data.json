    "The user is describing a classic immunology experiment scenario. Let's break it down to identify the correct process.\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery and Uptake:** Rotavirus capsid proteins (the antigen) are delivered orally. They travel through the GI tract and are taken up in the Peyer's patches, which are a type of Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) and function as secondary lymphoid organs for the intestine. This is the site where the adaptive immune response to the gut antigen will be initiated.\n\n2.  **Cellular Proliferation:** The observation of a \"proliferating cell population\" in the Peyer's patches after antigen exposure indicates clonal selection. This means that lymphocytes (specifically B cells and T cells) that recognize the rotavirus protein antigen have been activated and are dividing rapidly. For B cells, this proliferation occurs in specialized structures called germinal centers.\n\n3.  **High Variability in the Variable Heavy Chain Gene:** The key finding is the \"high variability\" observed when sequencing the *variable heavy chain gene* from this proliferating population. The variable region of an antibody (encoded by the variable gene segments) is what binds to the antigen. An increase in variability *during* an active immune response is characteristic of a specific process aimed at improving antibody quality.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options in the context of this scenario:\n\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors (and T cell receptors) by randomly combining V, D, and J gene segments. However, this occurs in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they ever encounter an antigen. It does not happen again in proliferating B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n*   **B) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system (a cascade of proteins) that helps clear pathogens. It has no role in altering the genetic sequence of B cell receptor genes.\n*   **C) Class switching recombination:** This process occurs in activated B cells in the germinal center. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, which switches the antibody's isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG). This alters the effector function of the antibody but does *not* affect the *variable* region or the antigen-binding specificity. The question specifies variability in the variable region, not a change in the constant region.\n*   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs specifically in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). It introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the DNA encoding the variable regions of both the heavy and light chains. This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different B cell receptors. Through a process of selection called affinity maturation, B cells with mutations that lead to higher-affinity binding for the antigen are selected to survive and proliferate. This process is the direct cause of the observed \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene during an active immune response.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating cell population isolated from a secondary lymphoid organ after antigen exposure is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
