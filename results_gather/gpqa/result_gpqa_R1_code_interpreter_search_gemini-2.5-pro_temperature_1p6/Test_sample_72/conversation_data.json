    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed (`v_rel`) between them.\nb) The total energy (`E_total`) of the system.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n*   Mass of Astronaut 1 (`m1`): 2m\n*   Velocity of Astronaut 1 (`v1`): 0.6c in the positive x-direction\n*   Mass of Astronaut 2 (`m2`): 3m\n*   Velocity of Astronaut 2 (`v2`): 0.5c in the positive x-direction\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Part A: Calculate the Relative Speed (`v_rel`)**\n\n*   **Concept:** Since the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light (relativistic), we cannot simply subtract them (`0.6c - 0.5c`). We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for relative speed. For two objects moving in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Substitute the given velocities `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c`.\n    *   `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n    *   `v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n    *   `v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n    *   `v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n    *   `v_rel = (1/7)c`\n    *   `v_rel ≈ 0.142857 c`\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part A:** The relative speed is approximately `0.14c`. This narrows down the possible answers to options B and C.\n\n**4. Part B: Calculate the Total Energy (`E_total`)**\n\n*   **Concept:** The total energy of a system is the sum of the individual energies of its components. The total energy (`E`) of a single particle moving at relativistic speed is given by the formula `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the energy of Astronaut 1 (`E1`)**\n    *   First, find the Lorentz factor `γ1` for astronaut 1.\n        *   `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1^2/c^2)`\n        *   `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)`\n        *   `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n        *   `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n        *   `γ1 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   Now, calculate the energy `E1`.\n        *   `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2`\n        *   `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2`\n        *   `E1 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the energy of Astronaut 2 (`E2`)**\n    *   First, find the Lorentz factor `γ2` for astronaut 2.\n        *   `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v2^2/c^2)`\n        *   `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2)`\n        *   `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n        *   `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n        *   `γ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866025 ≈ 1.1547`\n    *   Now, calculate the energy `E2`.\n        *   `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2`\n        *   `E2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2`\n        *   `E2 ≈ 3.4641 mc^2`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the Total Energy (`E_total`)**\n    *   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n    *   `E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2`\n    *   `E_total ≈ 5.9641 mc^2`\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part B:** The total energy is approximately `5.96 mc^2`.\n\n**5. Final Comparison and Answer**\n*   Our calculated relative speed is `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n*   Our calculated total energy is `E ≈ 5.96 mc^2`.\n*   These values match option C.\n\nTo ensure precision, let's use a Python script for the calculations.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nm = 1 # We can use m=1 as a base unit for mass\nc = 1 # We can use c=1 as a base unit for speed\n\nm1 = 2 * m\nv1 = 0.6 * c\n\nm2 = 3 * m\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Part 1: Relative Speed ---\n# v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c**2)\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c**2)\nprint(f\"Relative speed in units of c: {v_rel:.3f}\")\n\n# --- Part 2: Total Energy ---\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n# E = gamma * m * c^2\n\n# Astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1**2 / c**2))\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * c**2\n\n# Astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2**2 / c**2))\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * c**2\n\n# Total Energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\nprint(f\"Total energy in units of mc^2: {E_total:.3f}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",
