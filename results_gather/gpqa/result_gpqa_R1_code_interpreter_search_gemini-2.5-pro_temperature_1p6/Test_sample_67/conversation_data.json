    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is spin 1/2. Its spin state can be described by a 2-component vector (a spinor).\n    *   The particle is initially in a magnetic field `B_z` along the `+z` direction and is \"aligned\" with it. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -μ · B = -γS_z B`.\n    *   The spin operator in the z-basis is `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z`, where `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up, `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (spin down, `|-z>`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`. For alignment (lowest energy), assuming `γ > 0`, the energy is minimized when the spin is `+ħ/2`. So, the initial state is the spin-up state along z.\n    *   In vector notation, the initial state at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian for t > 0:**\n    *   The magnetic field is switched to the `+y` direction with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian is `H = -μ · B = -γB S_y`.\n    *   The spin operator `S_y` in the z-basis is `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   So, `H = -γB(ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) = exp(iγBt S_y / ħ)`.\n    *   Let's substitute `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`. The operator becomes `U(t) = exp(iγBt (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(γBt/2) σ_y)`.\n    *   To compute this matrix exponential, we use the property `(σ_y)^2 = I` (the identity matrix). The Taylor series expansion gives the well-known result:\n        `exp(iθσ_y) = I·cos(θ) + iσ_y·sin(θ)`.\n    *   Here, `θ = γBt/2`.\n    *   So, `U(t) = I·cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y·sin(γBt/2)`.\n    *   `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), 0], [0, cos(γBt/2)]] + i·sin(γBt/2)·[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    *   `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), 0], [0, cos(γBt/2)]] + [[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]`\n    *   `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = [[1], [0]]`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] [[1], [0]]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   In terms of basis vectors, `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Observable:**\n    *   We need the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Let's calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n        *   `<ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)>`: `<ψ(t)| = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]`.\n        *   `S_z|ψ(t)> = (ħ/2)σ_z|ψ(t)> = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]] = (ħ/2)[[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n        *   `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] · (ħ/2) [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        *   `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`.\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we get:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This expression describes an oscillation of the form `A·cos(ωt)`.\n    *   By comparing the terms, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `ω`.\n    *   `ω = γB`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin's expectation value vector precesses around the new magnetic field axis (`y`-axis) at the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`. The z-component of this precessing vector oscillates sinusoidally with this frequency.\n\nThe calculated frequency is `γB`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
