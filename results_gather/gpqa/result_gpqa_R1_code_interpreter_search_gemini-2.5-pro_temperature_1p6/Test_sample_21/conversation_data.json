    "1.  **Analyze the first part of the statement: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"**\n    *   **Thermodynamics** in electrochemistry relates to the spontaneity of a reaction, which is quantified by the standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° value indicates a stronger tendency for the species to be reduced, meaning it is a stronger oxidizing agent.\n    *   We need to compare the oxidizing strength of oxygen in basic solution to its strength in acidic solution (which is the common reference).\n    *   The half-reaction for the reduction of oxygen in **acidic solution** is:\n        O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l), with a standard reduction potential E° = +1.23 V.\n    *   The half-reaction for the reduction of oxygen in **basic solution** is:\n        O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq), with a standard reduction potential E° = +0.40 V.\n    *   Comparing the two potentials: +0.40 V (basic) < +1.23 V (acidic).\n    *   Since the reduction potential of oxygen is significantly lower (less positive) in basic solution than in acidic solution, oxygen is thermodynamically a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second part of the statement: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"**\n    *   **Kinetics** deals with the rate of a reaction. A thermodynamically favorable reaction (positive E°cell) does not guarantee a fast reaction.\n    *   The reduction of oxygen (O₂) is a multi-electron transfer process (4 electrons) and involves the breaking of a strong O=O double bond. This bond has a high activation energy.\n    *   This high activation energy barrier makes the reduction of oxygen kinetically slow, a phenomenon often referred to as a high overpotential for oxygen reduction. This sluggishness is a well-known characteristic of oxygen electrochemistry and is a major challenge in technologies like fuel cells.\n    *   This kinetic limitation is present in both acidic and basic media. Therefore, even though oxygen is a strong oxidant thermodynamically in acidic solution, it reacts **slower** from a kinetic standpoint due to the high activation energy required to break the O=O bond and proceed through the multi-step electron transfer.\n\n3.  **Combine the findings.**\n    *   The first blank is **weaker**.\n    *   The second blank is **slower**.\n    *   This corresponds to the combination \"weaker - slower\".\n\n4.  **Match with the options.**\n    *   A) weaker – faster\n    *   B) stronger – faster\n    *   C) stronger – slower\n    *   D) weaker - slower\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
