    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Basic Structure**\n\n*   First, let's sum the integrations from the 1H NMR data: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n*   Now let's check the number of protons in the proposed molecules:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₃):** 3 (acetate) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (vinyl) + 3 (vinyl methyl) = 8 protons. This matches the data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate:** Common isomers like but-1-en-1-yl acetate (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₂CH₃) or but-2-en-1-yl acetate (CH₃COOCH₂CH=CHCH₃) have 10 protons (3+1+1+2+3=10 or 3+2+1+1+3=10). This does not match the data.\n*   Based on the total proton count, we can confidently eliminate Cis-butenyl acetate (A) and Trans-butenyl acetate (B). The compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Assign the 1H NMR Signals to Propenyl Acetate**\n\nLet's look at the structure of propenyl acetate: CH₃(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d).\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This is a singlet (s) integrating to 3 protons. This chemical shift and multiplicity are highly characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (CH₃(a)-COO-), which are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a doublet (d) integrating to 3 protons. This corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond (CH₃(d)). It is a doublet because it is split by the single proton on the adjacent carbon (CH(c)).\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:** These two signals, each integrating to 1H, belong to the two protons on the double bond, CH(b) and CH(c).\n    *   The proton CH(b) is directly attached to a carbon that is bonded to an oxygen atom (-O-CH=). This oxygen atom is strongly deshielding, which shifts the signal far downfield. Therefore, the **7.0 ppm (1H, d)** signal corresponds to CH(b). It is a doublet because it is only coupled to the other vinyl proton, CH(c).\n    *   The proton CH(c) is coupled to both CH(b) and the three protons of the CH₃(d) group. The coupling to CH(b) makes it a doublet, and the coupling to the CH₃(d) group makes it a quartet. The combined multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). This perfectly matches the signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe final piece of information needed to distinguish between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinyl protons, CH(b) and CH(c).\n\n*   The signal for CH(b) at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   A key rule in 1H NMR spectroscopy for alkenes is:\n    *   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans):** The coupling constant between two protons in a *trans* configuration across a double bond is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis):** The coupling constant between two protons in a *cis* configuration is smaller, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, which falls squarely in the range for trans-coupling, the double bond must have a **trans** geometry.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe data indicates the compound has 8 protons, an acetate group, and a propenyl group with a trans configuration. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
