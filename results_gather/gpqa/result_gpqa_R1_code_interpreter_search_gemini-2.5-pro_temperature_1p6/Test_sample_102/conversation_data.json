    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   The parent is acetophenone (a phenyl ring attached to an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The phenyl ring is substituted with:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent affects electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n\nThe main challenge is introducing the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group at a position that is *meta* to the other two groups.\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Routes**\n\nThe acetyl group must be introduced using a Friedel-Crafts acylation (e.g., CH3COCl/AlCl3). A critical rule for this reaction is that it fails on strongly deactivated rings, particularly those with a nitro group. Therefore, the Friedel-Crafts acylation must be one of the earlier steps, before nitration. This immediately raises flags for options that add the acetyl group late in the sequence.\n\nLet's consider two plausible direct sequences starting with acylation:\n\n*   **Path A: Acylation → Nitration → Bromination**\n    1.  **Benzene → Acetophenone:** (CH3COCl/AlCl3). Correct first step.\n    2.  **Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone:** (HNO3/H2SO4). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, so this step correctly places the nitro group at position 3.\n    3.  **3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** (Br2/FeBr3). The ring now has two *meta*-directing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2) at positions 1 and 3. Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to position 5. This provides excellent regiochemical control. The main drawback might be the slow reaction rate, as the ring is heavily deactivated by two groups.\n\n*   **Path B: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**\n    1.  **Benzene → Acetophenone:** (CH3COCl/AlCl3). Correct first step.\n    2.  **Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** (Br2/FeBr3). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, correctly placing the bromine at position 3.\n    3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** (HNO3/H2SO4). The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). Their directing effects are conflicting:\n        *   -COCH3 directs the new group to position 5.\n        *   -Br directs the new group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        Although the effects conflict, experimental evidence shows that the major product of this reaction is indeed the desired **3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**. The positions ortho/para to bromine are also heavily deactivated by the acetyl group, making position 5 kinetically favorable.\n\nBoth 3-step paths are chemically viable. Now let's analyze the given options.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options**\n\n*   **A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on *p*-bromonitrobenzene. This reaction will fail or give extremely low yield because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2 ...**\n    *   This sequence converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene (step iv). This is a useless loop and does not advance the synthesis. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on aniline. The lone pair on the aniline nitrogen coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the catalyst and making the ring strongly deactivated and meta-directing. This reaction is not a standard, high-yield procedure. Even if it worked to give 3-aminoacetophenone, the subsequent bromination (step iv) would be directed by the powerful amino group to its ortho/para positions (2, 4, 6), not the required position 5. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   The first three steps of this option correspond exactly to **Path B** described above:\n        *   i) **Acetophenone** is formed.\n        *   ii) **3-Bromoacetophenone** is formed.\n        *   iii) **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** (the target molecule) is formed as the major product.\n    *   This sequence of three steps is a valid, high-yield synthesis for the target molecule. The additional four steps listed (iv to vii) are nonsensical. If you were to perform them on the target molecule, you would reduce the nitro group (iv), then attempt a problematic nitration of an amine (v), and then remove an amine via diazotization (vi, vii), which would ultimately lead to a different product entirely.\n    *   Given that options A, B, and D are fundamentally flawed due to incorrect chemical principles, Option C is the only plausible choice. It contains a correct and efficient synthetic route within its first three steps. The remaining steps are likely an error in the question's formulation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence beginning with i) Acylation, ii) Bromination, and iii) Nitration successfully produces the target compound in high yield. This sequence is the start of option C. Despite the superfluous and incorrect subsequent steps listed, it is the only option that contains a valid synthetic pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>"
