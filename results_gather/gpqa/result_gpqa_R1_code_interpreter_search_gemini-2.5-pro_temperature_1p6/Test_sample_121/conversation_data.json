    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction introduces a bromine atom at the carbon alpha to the carboxyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The α-carbon in acetic acid is the methyl carbon. One of its hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: **Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH)**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid group reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The -OH of the carboxyl group is replaced by the ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) from ethanol.\n    *   Structure of Product 2: **Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile, and bromide (Br-) is a good leaving group. This is a classic nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Structure of Product 3: **Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process analogous to the malonic ester synthesis for ring formation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. This carbon is particularly acidic because it is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (the nitrile -CN and the ester -COOCH2CH3). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction, displacing a bromide ion.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH, indicating enough base is present for a second deprotonation. The α-proton of the newly alkylated product is still acidic. NaH removes this proton to form a new carbanion.\n        `(NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [(NC)(EtOOC)C-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n        This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This cyclization forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group.\n    *   Structure of Product 4: **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals. This means we need to identify all sets of protons that are not chemically equivalent. Two protons are chemically equivalent if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like rotation or reflection) or a rapid conformational change.\n\n*   **Structure:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n          CN\n          |\n      C1----COOCH2CH3\n     / \\\n    H2C--CH2\n    |    |\n    H2C--CH2\n      \\  /\n       CH2\n*   **Symmetry:**\n    *   The C1 carbon is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOCH2CH3, and the two different paths around the ring which originate from C1 (-C2- and -C6-). Because the substituents -CN and -COOCH2CH3 are different, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is chiral and has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It belongs to the C1 point group (no symmetry).\n*   **Signal Counting:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two protons of the methylene group are technically diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. However, in routine NMR analysis, especially when the chiral center is several bonds away, they are often observed as a single signal. We will count them as **1 signal**, which is a standard convention in such problems.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The ring consists of five -CH2- groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n        *   Because the molecule has no symmetry, none of these CH2 groups are equivalent. C2 is different from C6, C3 is different from C5, and C4 is unique. So we have 5 distinct CH2 groups.\n        *   Within each -CH2- group on the ring, the two geminal protons (e.g., the axial and equatorial protons in a chair conformation) are diastereotopic. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1 and cannot be interchanged by symmetry or chair-flipping. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and will produce separate signals.\n        *   So, each of the 5 non-equivalent CH2 groups will show 2 distinct proton signals.\n        *   Number of signals from the ring = 5 CH2 groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Total Signals = (Signals from Ethyl group) + (Signals from Ring)\n    *   Total Signals = (1 from -CH3 + 1 from -OCH2-) + (10 from ring)\n    *   Total Signals = 2 + 10 = **12 signals**.\n\nThe question explicitly asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, even if they are not practically distinguishable. Our analysis shows 10 distinct protons on the ring and 2 distinct sets of protons on the ethyl group (using the standard convention for the methylene part), leading to a total of 12. This matches one of the options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
