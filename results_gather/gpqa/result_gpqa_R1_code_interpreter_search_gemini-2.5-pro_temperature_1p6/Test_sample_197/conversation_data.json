    "This problem requires us to calculate the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify all cobalt-containing species:**\n    In a solution of `Co^2+` and `SCN-`, the following species will exist in equilibrium:\n    *   Free cobalt ion: `Co^2+`\n    *   Monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]+`\n    *   Dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)2]` (the species of interest, noted as being blue)\n    *   Trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)3]-`\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]`\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (βn) to relate the concentrations:**\n    The formation of each complex from the free metal ion and ligand is described by its overall stability constant:\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+` : `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2]` : `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]-`: `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]2-`: `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\n4.  **Express the concentration of each complex in terms of `[Co^2+]` and `[SCN-]`:**\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n5.  **Calculate the mole fraction (αn) of each species:**\n    The mole fraction of any species is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in `α2` for `[Co(SCN)2]`.\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    By substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 4, we get a general formula for the mole fractions:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Plug in the given values and calculate:**\n    *   `[SCN-] = 0.1` M (We assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the initial concentration because the total cobalt concentration is much smaller).\n    *   `β1=9`, `β2=40`, `β3=63`, `β4=16`.\n\n    To make the calculation cleaner, let's compute each term in the denominator of the mole fraction equation:\n    *   Term for `Co^2+` : 1\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]+` : `β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)2]` : `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)3]-`: `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)4]2-`: `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    The denominator (sum of all terms) is:\n    `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    The numerator for `α2` is the term corresponding to `[Co(SCN)2]`, which is `0.4`.\n\n    Now, calculate the mole fraction `α2`:\n    `α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n7.  **Convert the fraction to a percentage:**\n    Percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]` = `α2 * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value matches option C. To be completely sure, let's use a Python script to perform the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Given thiocyanate concentration\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The formula for the mole fraction of the nth complex is:\n# alpha_n = (beta_n * [L]^n) / (1 + sum(beta_i * [L]^i for i=1 to N))\n# We want to find alpha_2, which corresponds to the [Co(SCN)2] complex.\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator of the alpha formula\nterm0 = 1  # For the free Co^2+ ion (beta_0 is defined as 1)\nterm1 = beta1 * (scn_conc**1)\nterm2 = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\nterm3 = beta3 * (scn_conc**3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (scn_conc**4)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator for the [Co(SCN)2] complex is term2\nnumerator_2 = term2\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator_2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_2 = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The calculated percentage of [Co(SCN)2] is: {percentage_2:.1f}%\")\n```\n\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, among all cobalt-containing species in a solution.\n\nFirst, let's identify all the cobalt species present in the solution. In the presence of thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`), cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) can form a series of complexes:\n*   `Co^2+` (free ion)\n*   `[Co(SCN)]^+`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]^-`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)`\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]^- + [Co(SCN)4]^(2-)`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (βn):\n`βn = [Co(SCN)n] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^n)`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of `[Co^2+]`, `[SCN-]`, and the stability constants:\n*   `[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]^- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]^(2-) = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\nThe mole fraction (αn) of a specific complex `[Co(SCN)n]` is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`. We are interested in `α2` for the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex.\n`α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions for each species concentration into the equation for `c(Co)`, we can factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nNow, we can write the expression for `α2`:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation for the mole fraction:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1` M\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nLet's calculate the value of each term in the expression:\n*   `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4` (This is the numerator)\n*   The denominator is the sum of the following terms:\n    *   1 (for free `Co^2+`)\n    *   `β1 * [SCN-]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nSum of denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, we calculate the mole fraction `α2`:\n`α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of `[Co(SCN)2]` = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
