    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Normalization\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n|ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The norm squared of the state is ⟨ψ|ψ⟩, which is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of its components.\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nThe normalization constant is 1/√6. So, the normalized state vector, which we'll also call |ψ⟩ for simplicity, is:\n|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\n### 2. Operators\n\nThe operators for the observables P and Q are given by the matrices:\nP = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\nQ = `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n### 3. Measurement of P\n\nThe first step is the measurement of observable P, with the desired outcome being the eigenvalue 0.\n\n**a. Find the eigenvector of P for eigenvalue 0.**\nWe need to find the vector |p₀⟩ such that P|p₀⟩ = 0 * |p₀⟩ = 0.\nLet |p₀⟩ = `[[x], [y], [z]]`.\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]` * `[[x], [y], [z]]` = `[[0], [0], [0]]`\n\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1.  (1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0\n2.  (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0 => x + z = 0 => x = -z\n3.  (1/√2)y = 0 => y = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form `[[-z], [0], [z]]`. To normalize it, we set z=1 to get the unnormalized vector `[[-1], [0], [1]]`.\nThe norm squared is (-1)² + 0² + 1² = 2.\nThe normalized eigenvector |p₀⟩ for the eigenvalue 0 is:\n|p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[-1], [0], [1]]`\n\n**b. Calculate the probability of measuring P=0.**\nThe probability of obtaining the result 0 when measuring P is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state |ψ⟩ onto the eigenvector |p₀⟩.\nProb(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ⟩|²\n\n⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = [(1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]] * [(1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`]\n⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√12) * ((-1)*(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1)\n⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√12) * (1 + 0 + 1) = 2/√12 = 2/(2√3) = 1/√3\n\nProb(P=0) = (1/√3)² = 1/3\n\n**c. State collapse after measurement.**\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector |p₀⟩.\nThe new state of the system is |ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩.\n|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[-1], [0], [1]]`\n\n### 4. Measurement of Q\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q on the new state |ψ'⟩, with the desired outcome being the eigenvalue -1.\n\n**a. Find the eigenvector of Q for eigenvalue -1.**\nWe need to find the vector |q₋₁⟩ such that Q|q₋₁⟩ = -1 * |q₋₁⟩.\nLet |q₋₁⟩ = `[[a], [b], [c]]`.\n`[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]` * `[[a], [b], [c]]` = `[[-a], [-b], [-c]]`\n\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1.  a = -a => 2a = 0 => a = 0\n2.  0 = -b => b = 0\n3.  -c = -c => c can be any value.\n\nTo normalize, we set c=1. The vector is `[[0], [0], [1]]`.\nThe norm squared is 0² + 0² + 1² = 1, so it is already normalized.\nThe normalized eigenvector |q₋₁⟩ for the eigenvalue -1 is:\n|q₋₁⟩ = `[[0], [0], [1]]`\n\n**b. Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1.**\nThis probability is calculated on the collapsed state |ψ'⟩.\nProb(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²\n\n⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [[0, 0, 1]] * [(1/√2) * `[[-1], [0], [1]]`]\n⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2) * (0*(-1) + 0*0 + 1*1)\n⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = 1/√2\n\nProb(Q=-1 | P=0) = (1/√2)² = 1/2\n\n### 5. Combined Probability\n\nThe probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities.\nTotal Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)\nTotal Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6"
