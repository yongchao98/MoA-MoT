    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are:\n    1.  The presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n    2.  The presence of axial chirality, often due to restricted rotation about a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (atropisomerism).\n    A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a biphenyl derivative. It has two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond. On each ring, there are two bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). Specifically, a nitro group (-NO2) and a dimethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3) are on each ring in ortho positions relative to the inter-ring bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The four bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar. Because of the substitution pattern, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, a type of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This molecule is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. This carbon atom is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since the carbon atom is bonded to four different substituents, it is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon). A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** This molecule does not have any chiral centers. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a C2 axis of rotation passing through the C=O bond. It also has a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is achiral (superimposable on its mirror image), it will not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The key feature is the carbon-carbon double bond, with the two ester groups (-COOCH3) in a *trans* configuration.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C double bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Summary:**\n    *   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n    *   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
