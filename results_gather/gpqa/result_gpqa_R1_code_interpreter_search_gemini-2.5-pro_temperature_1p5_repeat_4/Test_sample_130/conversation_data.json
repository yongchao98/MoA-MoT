    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR of the anhydride: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. A signal at ~7 ppm is typical for vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are deshielded by adjacent electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   ¹³C NMR of the anhydride: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n        *   The simplest structure fitting this data is **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent vinylic protons (explaining the single ¹H peak) and two types of equivalent carbons (two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons), explaining the two ¹³C peaks. Maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid) is the corresponding *cis*-dicarboxylic acid.\n\n        ```\n             O\n            // \\\n           C   C=O\n          / \\ /\n        H--C=C--H\n        Maleic Anhydride\n        ```\n\n    *   **Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with four methyl groups on the conjugated double bond system (C1-C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n3.  **Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The stereochemistry of the addition can be either *endo* or *exo*.\n    *   The **endo rule** for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions states that the major product results from the orientation where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are positioned under the newly formed ring, allowing for stabilizing secondary orbital overlap. In this case, the anhydride part of the dienophile will be oriented towards the C=C double bond of the resulting bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   **Major product = *endo* adduct**\n        *   **Minor product = *exo* adduct**\n    *   The molecular formula of the products is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structures and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   The problem relies on a 2D NOESY NMR experiment. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The key information is: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product.\"\n    *   This means we must find a pair of protons that are spatially close in the *endo* isomer (major) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor).\n    *   Let's identify the proton signals based on the provided options and general chemical shift knowledge. Both isomers have a plane of symmetry, simplifying the spectra.\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride). They are on carbons C2 and C3 of the bicyclic system.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (the vinylic methyls on C5 and C6).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4).\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7).\n\n5.  **Correlate Structure with NOESY Data:**\n    *   Let's examine the spatial relationships in the two isomers.\n\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** The anhydride group (and its protons, H_anhydride) is oriented \"endo,\" meaning it points towards the C5=C6 double bond. This brings the H_anhydride protons very close to the vinylic methyl groups attached to C5 and C6. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two groups of protons.\n\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** The anhydride group (and H_anhydride) is oriented \"exo,\" meaning it points away from the C5=C6 double bond. The distance between the H_anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups is now significantly larger. The NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n    *   This analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem. The cross-peak that distinguishes the major from the minor product is the one between the H_anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   The H_anhydride protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The vinylic methyl protons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects these two signals.\n\n    Let's check the options again:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> Bridgehead Me and Bridge CH. Distances likely similar in both isomers.\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> Bridgehead Me and Vinyl Me. Distances are fixed by the rigid frame and are identical in both isomers.\n    C) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** -> Vinyl Me and H_anhydride. Close in endo, far in exo. This is the correct answer.\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Bridge CH and H_anhydride. These are actually closer in the *exo* (minor) isomer than in the *endo* isomer. This is the opposite of the observation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
