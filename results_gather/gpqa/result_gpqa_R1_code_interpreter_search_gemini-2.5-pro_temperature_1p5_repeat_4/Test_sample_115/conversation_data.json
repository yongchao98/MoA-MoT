    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound D.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   The problem provides the proton NMR data for Compound A:\n    *   A triplet at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H.\n    *   A quartet at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H.\n*   Let's analyze the signals:\n    *   **Triplet for 6H**: A triplet indicates that the protons are adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH₂ group), according to the n+1 rule (n+1=3, so n=2). An integration of 6H corresponds to two equivalent methyl (CH₃) groups. So, we have two CH₃ groups each adjacent to a CH₂ group.\n    *   **Quartet for 4H**: A quartet indicates that the protons are adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a CH₃ group) (n+1=4, so n=3). An integration of 4H corresponds to two equivalent methylene (CH₂) groups. So, we have two CH₂ groups each adjacent to a CH₃ group.\n*   Putting this together, the structure contains two equivalent ethyl groups (CH₃-CH₂-). For these two ethyl groups to be equivalent, they must be arranged symmetrically in the molecule. The simplest such alkane is n-butane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   In n-butane, the two terminal CH₃ groups are equivalent, and the two internal CH₂ groups are equivalent. The CH₃ protons (6H) are adjacent to a CH₂ group, so they appear as a triplet. The CH₂ protons (4H) are adjacent to a CH₃ group, so they appear as a quartet.\n*   The chemical shifts (0.9 ppm for methyl, 1.3 ppm for methylene) are characteristic for an alkane.\n*   Therefore, **Compound A is n-butane**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a free-radical halogenation reaction.\n    *   CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ + Br₂ → Compound B\n*   There are two possible positions for bromination: C1 (primary) and C2 (secondary).\n    *   Bromination at C1 gives 1-bromobutane.\n    *   Bromination at C2 gives 2-bromobutane.\n*   Free-radical bromination is highly selective, favoring the formation of the more stable radical intermediate. A secondary radical is more stable than a primary radical. Therefore, the major product will be 2-bromobutane.\n*   **Compound B is 2-bromobutane**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction that proceeds via an E2 elimination mechanism.\n    *   CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂-CH₃ + alc. KOH → Compound C\n*   The base removes a proton from a carbon adjacent (beta) to the carbon bearing the bromine. There are two different beta-protons:\n    *   Removal of a proton from C1 yields but-1-ene (CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   Removal of a proton from C3 yields but-2-ene (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃).\n*   According to Zaitsev's rule, the major product is the more substituted (more stable) alkene. But-2-ene is a disubstituted alkene, while but-1-ene is monosubstituted. So, but-2-ene is the major product.\n*   The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers. But-1-ene does not have geometrical isomers. But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene.\n*   Therefore, **Compound C is but-2-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound D**\n\n*   The *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol in a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **Diene**: (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol\n    *   **Dienophile**: *cis*-but-2-ene\n*   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction that forms a six-membered ring, which is a substituted cyclohexene. The product is named as a cyclohex-2-enol. The substituents are derived from the reactants:\n    *   The OH group from the diene is at C1.\n    *   The methyl group from the diene is at C4.\n    *   The two methyl groups from the dienophile are at C5 and C6.\n*   The product structure is **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Stereochemistry of Compound D**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the stereochemistry of the reactants and the geometry of the transition state. The endo rule predicts the major product.\n*   **Diene Stereochemistry**: For (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol in the required s-cis conformation, the OH group at C1 is \"outer\" and the H is \"inner\". The CH₃ group at C4 is \"inner\" and its H is \"outer\".\n*   **Dienophile Stereochemistry**: For *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups are on the same side of the double bond.\n*   **Endo Rule**: The reaction proceeds via the *endo* transition state, where the substituents of the dienophile (the two methyl groups) are oriented towards the π-system of the diene.\n*   This leads to the following relative stereochemistry in the product:\n    1.  The two methyl groups from the dienophile (at C5 and C6) are *cis* to each other.\n    2.  The \"inner\" substituents of the diene (H at C1, CH₃ at C4) are *cis* to the *endo* substituents of the dienophile (CH₃ at C5, CH₃ at C6).\n    3.  The \"outer\" substituents of the diene (OH at C1, H at C4) are *trans* to the *endo* substituents of the dienophile.\n*   From this, we can deduce the relative arrangement of all substituents. Let's define one enantiomer by setting the three methyl groups (at C4, C5, and C6) to be on the same face of the ring (e.g., \"up\" or wedge).\n    *   Me at C4 is wedge. Me at C5 is wedge. Me at C6 is wedge.\n    *   At C1, H is *cis* to the other methyls, so H is also wedge. The OH group must be dash (\"down\").\n*   **Assigning R/S Configuration**: Now we assign the absolute configuration for this specific enantiomer.\n    *   **C1**: The lowest priority group (H) is on a wedge. The sequence of other groups (OH → C2 → C6) is clockwise (R). Since H is wedged, we reverse the assignment to **S**. So, it is **1S**.\n    *   **C4**: The lowest priority group (H) is on a dash. The sequence of other groups (C3 → C5 → CH₃) is clockwise (R). We keep the assignment as **R**. So, it is **4R**.\n    *   **C5**: The lowest priority group (H) is on a dash. The sequence of other groups (C6 → C4 → CH₃) is counter-clockwise (S). We keep the assignment as **S**. So, it is **5S**.\n    *   **C6**: The lowest priority group (H) is on a dash. The sequence of other groups (C1 → C5 → CH₃) is clockwise (R). We keep the assignment as **R**. So, it is **6R**.\n*   The resulting configuration for this enantiomer is **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product, Compound D, is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
