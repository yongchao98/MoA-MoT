    "The user wants to know which fundamental symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT).\n\n1.  **Analyze Lorentz Symmetry:** The Standard Model (SM) is a quantum field theory built on the principle of Lorentz invariance. The SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant extension of the SM. All fields and derivatives are combined into operators that transform as Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Analyze Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a fundamental spacetime symmetry upon which the Standard Model and SMEFT are built. The Lagrangian, and thus all the operators within it, must be invariant under Poincare transformations.\n\n3.  **Analyze CP Symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model, specifically by the weak interaction via the complex phase in the CKM matrix. Since SMEFT is an effective theory that includes the Standard Model and parametrizes its possible extensions, it must allow for CP-violating operators. In fact, SMEFT is a tool used to search for new sources of CP violation beyond the SM. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.\n\n4.  **Analyze CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). SMEFT is formulated as such a theory. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must be CPT-invariant. A violation of CPT would imply a breakdown of the fundamental tenets of local quantum field theory.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Lorentz Symmetry (1) is required.\n*   Poincare Symmetry (2) is required.\n*   CP Symmetry (3) is *not* required.\n*   CPT Symmetry (4) is required.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
