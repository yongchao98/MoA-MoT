    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames:**\n    *   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled by the ejecta.\n    *   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   **Relative velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper time (Δt'):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the proper time because it's measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n    *   **Speed of light (c):** We will use the standard value `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Physics Principles:**\n    *   The distance traveled in any frame is given by `distance = speed × time`. In the Galaxy's frame, this is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, time is relative. The time measured in the stationary frame (S) is related to the proper time measured in the moving frame (S') by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`.\n    *   The term `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (β).**\n        `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n        This is the dilated time.\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the distance (d) traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n6.  **Perform the final calculation using Python.**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # Velocity in km/s\ndelta_t_prime = 50  # Proper time in seconds\nc = 300000  # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time in the Galaxy's reference frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t_galaxy = gamma * delta_t_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance_in_galaxy_frame = v * delta_t_galaxy\n\nprint(distance_in_galaxy_frame)\n```\n<execute_result>\n3061862.178478448\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer without considering relativistic effects: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option C, `3,060,000 km`.

    "The user wants me to solve a problem related to special relativity.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concepts:** The problem involves two different inertial frames of reference moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 60,000 km/s`, `c = 300,000 km/s`, so `v = 0.2c`). This indicates that the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, must be used.\n\n2.  **Define the Reference Frames:**\n    *   **Galaxy Reference Frame (let's call it S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from the perspective of which we need to calculate the distance.\n    *   **Ejecta Reference Frame (let's call it S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time measurement of 50 seconds is given in this frame.\n\n3.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity between frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (the moving frame), `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is stationary within the moving frame.\n    *   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n4.  **State the Goal:**\n    *   Calculate the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame (frame S).\n\n5.  **Formulate the Plan:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (frame S).\n    *   The time `Δt` in the Galaxy frame is not the same as the time `Δt'` in the ejecta's frame. We must use the time dilation formula to relate them:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   So, the full plan is:\n        a. Calculate `v/c`.\n        b. Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n        c. Use `γ` to find the dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame.\n        d. Use `Δt` to calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n6.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   **Step a: Calculate v/c (often denoted as β)**\n        `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   **Step b: Calculate the Lorentz factor γ**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   **Step c: Calculate the dilated time Δt**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   **Step d: Calculate the distance d**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n    *   Now, I will use the provided python code's output to get a precise numerical value. The code executes this exact calculation.\n\n7.  **Review the Code Output:**\n    *   The code calculated: `3061862.178478973`\n    *   This means the distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic answer, `60,000 km/s * 50 s`, which is incorrect).\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\n    The calculated value `3,061,862 km` is very close to option C `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the option choices. Therefore, C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
