    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars (ρ), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant everywhere.\n    *   ρ = constant\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:** Consider a thin spherical shell of space around the observer. Let the shell have a radius *d* and a small thickness *dd*. The volume of this shell (*dV*) can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of the sphere = 4πd²\n    *   Volume of the shell, dV = 4πd² * dd\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars (*dN*) within this thin shell is the density (ρ) multiplied by the volume of the shell (dV).\n    *   dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd\n\n4.  **Introducing Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance *d*. For simplicity in astronomical calculations, if *d* is in parsecs and parallax *plx* is in arcseconds, the relationship is:\n    *   plx = 1/d\n    *   This can be rearranged to express distance in terms of parallax: d = 1/plx\n\n5.  **Relating Distance Interval to Parallax Interval:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/d(plx)). To find this, we need to express the thickness of the shell (*dd*) in terms of a small change in parallax (*d(plx)*). We can do this by differentiating the expression for *d* with respect to *plx*.\n    *   d = 1/plx = plx⁻¹\n    *   dd/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²\n    *   So, dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)\n\n6.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Parallax Range:** Now we substitute the expressions for *d* and *dd* in terms of *plx* into our equation for *dN*.\n    *   dN = ρ * 4π * d² * dd\n    *   dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * [- (1/plx²) * d(plx)]\n    *   dN = - (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n7.  **Interpreting the Result:** The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax. This is the magnitude of the ratio dN/d(plx). The negative sign simply indicates that as distance *d* increases, parallax *plx* decreases. Since star counts must be positive, we take the absolute value.\n    *   |dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Since 4, π, and ρ are all constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n    *   Number of stars per unit range of plx ~ 1/plx⁴\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
