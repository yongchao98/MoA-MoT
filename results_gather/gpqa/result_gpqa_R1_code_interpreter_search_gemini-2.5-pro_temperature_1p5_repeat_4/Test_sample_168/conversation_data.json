    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Original Decay:**\n    *   The reaction is `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`.\n    *   The initial state consists of two heavy nucleons A. Let their total rest energy be `E_initial = 2 * m_A * c^2`.\n    *   The final state consists of six particles: two heavy nucleons B, two light particles E, and two light particles V.\n    *   The total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy.\n    *   `Q_original = E_initial - E_final_rest = (2m_A)c^2 - (2m_B + 2m_E + 2m_V)c^2`.\n    *   This Q-value is distributed as kinetic energy among the final particles (2B, 2E, 2V).\n    *   The problem states that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is *continuous*. This is a key piece of information. A continuous energy spectrum for a decay product is a hallmark of a multi-body final state (more than two particles). In this case, the kinetic energy `Q_original` is shared among at least three particles (e.g., the two E particles and the two V particles, ignoring the small recoil kinetic energy of the heavy B nucleons). Because the energy can be distributed among these particles in a continuous range of ways while still conserving energy and momentum, any single particle (or pair of particles like 2E) will have a continuous energy spectrum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Variant Decay:**\n    *   The reaction is `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`.\n    *   The initial state is the same as the original decay.\n    *   The final state consists of five particles: two B, two E, and one exotic, *massless* particle M.\n    *   Let's calculate the Q-value for this variant decay:\n    *   `Q_variant = E_initial - E_final_rest = (2m_A)c^2 - (2m_B + 2m_E + m_M)c^2`.\n    *   Since M is massless, `m_M = 0`. So, `Q_variant = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E)c^2`.\n    *   This decay also results in a multi-body final state (2B, 2E, M). Therefore, the kinetic energy `Q_variant` is shared among these particles, and the total energy spectrum of the E particles will also be *continuous*.\n    *   This eliminates options A and D, which claim the spectrum becomes discrete. A discrete spectrum (a sharp peak) would only occur if the two E particles were the *only* final products besides the recoiling nucleus B (e.g., in a decay like 2A -> 2B + 2E).\n\n3.  **Compare the Endpoints:**\n    *   The \"endpoint\" of the total energy spectrum for the E particles refers to the maximum possible total energy this pair of particles can have. This maximum is achieved when all other final particles (excluding the recoiling B nucleons) are emitted with the minimum possible kinetic energy (i.e., zero).\n    *   The maximum kinetic energy available to the E particles is, therefore, the Q-value of the reaction.\n    *   So, we need to compare `Q_original` and `Q_variant`.\n    *   `Q_original = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E)c^2 - 2m_V c^2`\n    *   `Q_variant = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E)c^2`\n    *   The problem describes V as a \"lighter particle\", which implies it can have a mass (`m_V â‰¥ 0`), while M is explicitly \"massless\" (`m_M = 0`). Standard examples of \"light\" particles in nuclear decay are neutrinos, which we now know have a very small but non-zero mass.\n    *   Assuming `m_V > 0`, the term `2m_V c^2` is a positive value that is subtracted to find `Q_original`. For `Q_variant`, we subtract nothing (since `m_M=0`).\n    *   Therefore, `Q_variant > Q_original`.\n    *   This means the endpoint of the energy spectrum for the variant decay is higher than for the original decay.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The spectrum remains continuous because the variant decay still has a multi-body final state (2E and M share the energy).\n    *   The endpoint of the spectrum increases because the total rest mass of the final particles is lower in the variant decay (a single massless M replaces two light-but-massive V particles), resulting in a larger release of kinetic energy (a higher Q-value).\n    *   This matches the description in option C. The shape of the spectrum is also \"adjusted\" because the energy is shared among a different number of final-state particles (3 light particles in the variant vs. 4 in the original), which changes the phase space distribution.\n\n<<<C>>>"
