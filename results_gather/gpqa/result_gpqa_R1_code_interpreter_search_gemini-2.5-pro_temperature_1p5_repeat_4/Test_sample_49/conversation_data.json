    "This problem requires an understanding of how loop calculations are performed in quantum field theory and how different parts of a mathematical expression relate to the properties of a Feynman diagram.\n\nHere's the expression given: `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`.\n\nLet's break it down and analyze each component:\n\n1.  **Coupling Constants (`alpha^3 * g^2`)**:\n    *   `alpha` is the fine-structure constant, related to the elementary charge `e` (`alpha` ~ `e^2`). It represents the strength of the electromagnetic interaction. `alpha^3` implies that the diagram involves a total of `3 * 2 = 6` powers of the charge `e`, which corresponds to 6 vertices of the electromagnetic type.\n    *   `g` is another coupling constant for a different type of interaction. `g^2` implies two vertices of this 'g' type.\n    *   Together, `alpha^3 * g^2` tells us about the number and type of interaction vertices in the diagram. While this constrains the diagram's structure, it doesn't directly give the number of loops.\n\n2.  **Numerical Factors (`sqrt(2) * 8`)**:\n    *   These are plain numbers that typically arise from symmetry factors of the diagram, traces over gamma matrices in fermion loops, or group theory factors associated with the vertices. They do not determine the loop number.\n\n3.  **Ratio of Scales (`(Q/M)^2`)**:\n    *   `Q` and `M` represent energy scales or masses. Loop calculations often result in functions (like logarithms) of ratios of scales, such as `log(Q^2/M^2)`. The presence of such a term is a hallmark of a loop calculation, but its specific form doesn't uniquely determine the number of loops.\n\n4.  **The Loop Factor (`1/(4pi)^6`)**:\n    *   This is the most crucial piece of information for determining the number of loops. In quantum field theory, every loop in a Feynman diagram corresponds to an integration over an undetermined four-momentum `k`. The standard formalism for evaluating these integrals in four-dimensional spacetime leads to a characteristic factor for each loop.\n    *   For a single loop, the calculation involves an integral of the form `∫ d^4k / (2π)^4`. After a mathematical procedure known as Wick rotation and integrating over the angular components in 4D Euclidean space, this integral contributes a factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the final expression for the amplitude.\n    *   Therefore, for a diagram with `L` loops, there will be `L` such integrations, leading to a combined factor of `(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\n**Applying this to the problem:**\n\nThe expression contains the factor `1/(4π)^6`. We can equate this to the general formula for an L-loop diagram:\n\n`1/(4π)^(2L) = 1/(4π)^6`\n\nBy comparing the exponents, we get:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L`, the number of loops:\n\n`L = 6 / 2 = 3`\n\nThus, the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops. The other factors in the expression (`alpha^3 * g^2`, etc.) are consistent with a 3-loop diagram but the power of `4π` is the definitive clue.\n\n<<<D>>>"
