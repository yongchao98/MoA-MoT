As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Role of Each Gene from Single Mutants:**\n    *   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% resistance (our baseline).\n    *   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This means the G1 gene product is responsible for some part of the resistance. Its loss leads to a 25% reduction in resistance (100% - 75% = 25%).\n    *   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of the G2 gene product completely eliminates resistance. This is a very strong effect, suggesting G2 is essential and likely acts early or as a master regulator in the resistance pathway.\n    *   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The G3 gene product is also crucial. Its loss leads to a 50% reduction in resistance (100% - 50% = 50%).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Gene Interactions from Double Mutants (Epistasis Analysis):**\n    *   Epistasis is a phenomenon where the effect of one gene's mutation is masked by the mutation of another gene. The phenotype of the double mutant will resemble the phenotype of one of the single mutants. The gene whose phenotype is expressed is called \"epistatic\".\n\n    *   **g1g2 double mutant:** Resistance is 0%.\n        *   The g1 single mutant has 75% resistance.\n        *   The g2 single mutant has 0% resistance.\n        *   The double mutant's phenotype (0%) is identical to the g2 single mutant's phenotype.\n        *   **Conclusion:** G2 is epistatic to G1. This means G2 acts upstream of G1 in the genetic pathway. When G2 is non-functional, it doesn't matter whether G1 is functional or not; the pathway is already broken.\n\n    *   **g2g3 double mutant:** Resistance is 0%.\n        *   The g2 single mutant has 0% resistance.\n        *   The g3 single mutant has 50% resistance.\n        *   The double mutant's phenotype (0%) is identical to the g2 single mutant's phenotype.\n        *   **Conclusion:** G2 is epistatic to G3. This means G2 also acts upstream of G3.\n\n    *   **Combined Conclusion for G2:** Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and the problem states one gene is a transcription factor, G2 is the prime candidate. A transcription factor often acts as a master switch, activating multiple downstream genes. The pathway likely looks like this:\n        ```\n             G2 (Transcription Factor)\n              /   \\\n             v     v\n            G1    G3\n             \\   /\n              v v\n           Resistance\n        ```\n\n3.  **Analyze the g1g3 Interaction:**\n    *   **g1g3 double mutant:** Resistance is 10%.\n    *   This phenotype (10%) is different from both the g1 phenotype (75%) and the g3 phenotype (50%). Therefore, there is no simple epistasis between G1 and G3.\n    *   Let's predict the outcome if their effects were simply additive. The loss from g1 is 25%, and the loss from g3 is 50%. An additive loss would be 25% + 50% = 75%. This would leave 100% - 75% = 25% resistance.\n    *   The observed resistance (10%) is much lower than the expected additive result (25%). This is called a **synergistic interaction** (or synthetic enhancement). The combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects.\n    *   Synergistic interactions often point to **gene redundancy**. This means G1 and G3 have partially overlapping or cooperative functions in the same overall process (creating resistance). When one is lost, the other can partially compensate, but when both are lost, the function collapses more severely than expected.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.** Our analysis strongly supports this.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: **Correct.** This is the best description for the observed synergistic interaction in the g1g3 mutant.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **Incorrect.** The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g1 phenotype (75%).\n\n    *   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: **Incorrect.** G2 is the clear candidate for the TF.\n        *   This option is immediately ruled out.\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.**\n        *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a possible molecular mechanism, but \"gene redundancy\" is a better description of the functional genetic interaction we observe.\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: **Incorrect.** The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g3 phenotype (50%).\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.**\n        *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: **Incorrect terminology.** Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits. Here, multiple genes affect one trait. \"Gene redundancy\" or \"synergism\" is the correct term.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **Incorrect.**\n\n5.  **Final Choice:**\n    All options contain a flaw regarding the epistasis between G1 and G3. However, we must choose the *best* possible conclusion. Option A correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and provides the most accurate functional description of the G1-G3 interaction (\"gene redundancy\"). Despite the incorrect final clause, it has the most correct information derived directly from the experimental data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
