    "Here's my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2 ($L_1 / L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:**\n    *   **Luminosity of a Black Body:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n        $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n        where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Peak Wavelength of a Black Body:** The relationship between the peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{max}$) and the temperature (T) of a black body is given by Wien's Displacement Law:\n        $\\lambda_{max} = b / T$\n        where b is Wien's displacement constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** When a light source is moving relative to an observer, the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) changes compared to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$). For non-relativistic speeds, this is given by:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} \\approx \\lambda_{em} (1 + v_r/c)$\n        where $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive for moving away, negative for moving closer) and c is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 * R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$. This gives $(R_1/R_2)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25$.\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** $M_1 = 1.5 * M_2$. This information is not directly used in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, so it's likely extraneous.\n    *   **Radial Velocities:** $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. This is crucial because it affects the *observed* wavelengths.\n    *   **Peak Wavelength:** \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest...are the same.\" This means the *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$.\n\n5.  **Connect Wavelengths, Temperatures, and Velocities:**\n    *   Luminosity is an intrinsic property of a star and depends on its true (emitted) temperature, not the apparent temperature derived from Doppler-shifted light. Therefore, in the luminosity ratio formula, $T_1$ and $T_2$ must be the true surface temperatures of the stars.\n    *   We need to find the ratio of these true temperatures, $T_1/T_2$. We can do this by relating the observed wavelengths back to the emitted wavelengths and then to the true temperatures.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Relationship Between True Temperatures:**\n    *   From Wien's Law, the true temperature is related to the emitted peak wavelength: $T = b / \\lambda_{max,em}$.\n    *   Let's relate the observed peak wavelengths to the emitted ones using the Doppler formula:\n        *   For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,em,1} (1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{max,em,1}$.\n        *   For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s, so $\\lambda_{max,obs,2} = \\lambda_{max,em,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Since we are given $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{max,em,1} = \\lambda_{max,em,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Now substitute Wien's Law ($ \\lambda_{max,em} = b/T $) into this equation:\n        $b/T_1 = (b/T_2) * (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    *   Cancel out b and rearrange to find the ratio of true temperatures:\n        $1/T_1 = (1/T_2) * (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n        $T_2 / T_1 = 1 + v_{r2}/c$\n        $T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Now substitute the expressions for the radius ratio and temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n        $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n        $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c))^4$\n        $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)^4$\n    *   Use a Python script to compute the final numerical value accurately. The speed of light c is approximately 299792.458 km/s.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nR_ratio = 1.5\nv_r2 = 700  # in km/s\nc = 299792.458  # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the squared radius ratio\nR_ratio_sq = R_ratio**2\n\n# Calculate the Doppler factor\ndoppler_factor = 1 + v_r2 / c\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\n# L_ratio = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = R_ratio_sq * (1 / doppler_factor)^4\nL_ratio = R_ratio_sq / (doppler_factor**4)\n\nprint(L_ratio)\n```\n2.229156681285375\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~2.35\n    B) ~2.32\n    C) ~2.25\n    D) ~2.23\nThe calculated value is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the luminosity ratio of the two stars.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to the luminosity of Star_2 ($L_2$), which is $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Physical Laws**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a perfect black body is determined by its radius ($R$) and its surface temperature ($T$). The formula is:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects the true surface temperature ($T$) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{em}$). This is the *emitted* peak wavelength, not necessarily the observed one.\n    $\\lambda_{em} = b / T$\n    where $b$ is Wien's displacement constant.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** When a light source is moving relative to an observer with a radial velocity ($v_r$), the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) differs from the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$). For speeds much less than the speed of light ($c$), the non-relativistic formula is a very good approximation:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1 + v_r/c)$\n    A positive $v_r$ indicates the object is moving away (redshift), and a negative $v_r$ indicates it's moving closer (blueshift).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars, we can write the ratio of their luminosities:\n$L_1/L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n\nThe constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n$L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n**4. Use the Given Information to Find the Ratios**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 * R_2$. Therefore, the ratio $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$, and its square is $(R_1/R_2)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25$.\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the tricky part. We need the ratio of the true surface temperatures ($T_1/T_2$), but we are only given information about the *observed* peak wavelengths. We must relate the observed wavelengths back to the true temperatures.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   Let's apply the Doppler formula to each star to find its *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$).\n        *   For Star_1, $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1}(1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n        *   For Star_2, $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can equate the expressions for the emitted wavelengths:\n        $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    *   Now, we use Wien's Law ($T = b/\\lambda_{em}$) to relate the temperatures. From this, we can see that $T$ is inversely proportional to $\\lambda_{em}$. Therefore:\n        $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{em,2}/\\lambda_{em,1}$\n    *   From our Doppler-derived equation, we can find the ratio $\\lambda_{em,2}/\\lambda_{em,1}$:\n        $\\lambda_{em,2}/\\lambda_{em,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    *   Thus, the temperature ratio is:\n        $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Equation and Calculate**\nNow substitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio formula:\n$L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c))^4$\n$L_1/L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)^4$\n\nLet's plug in the numerical values and compute the result.\n*   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n*   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 299792.458$ km/s\n\n```python\n# Given values\nR_ratio = 1.5\nv_r2 = 700  # in km/s\nc = 299792.458  # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio using the derived formula\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 / (1 + v_r2/c)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R_ratio**2) / ((1 + v_r2 / c)**4)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\nThe calculation shows that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.229. Comparing this result with the given options, the closest value is 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>",
