    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Chemical Equilibrium:**\n    The problem describes a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. This complex is in equilibrium with its constituent ions. The formation reaction is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$\n    The problem asks for the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions, which are formed when the complex dissociates. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation:\n    $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Use the Formation Constant (K_f):**\n    The problem provides the formation constant (also called the stability constant) for the complex, $K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$. The expression for this constant is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:**\n    We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :-------------: |\n| $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$    |    0.02     |     -x     |     0.02 - x      |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           |      0      |     +x     |        x        |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         |      0      |     +x     |        x        |\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression:**\n    Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve:**\n    Because the formation constant $K_f$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium lies far to the side of the complex. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make a simplifying assumption:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation now becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we can solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nLet's use a Python script for a more precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant for Ca-EDTA\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # Initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_f = (initial_complex_conc - x) / x^2\n# We approximate initial_complex_conc - x ≈ initial_complex_conc because K_f is large.\n# So, K_f ≈ initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# This means x^2 ≈ initial_complex_conc / K_f\n# x represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca^2+ ions.\n\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation to match the options\nprint(f\"{x:.1e}\")\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation matches the manual derivation. The concentration of Ca²⁺ is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\n\n`[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻`\n\nThe formation constant, $K_f$, is given for the reverse reaction:\n\n`Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻`\n\nThe expression for the formation constant is:\n\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nWe can set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to find the concentration of the dissociated ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ at equilibrium.\n\n| Species           | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-------------------|:-----------:|:----------:|:---------------:|\n| `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻`     | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| `Ca²⁺`            | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| `EDTA⁴⁻`          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n\n$5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means that the amount of complex that dissociates, 'x', will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption that:\n\n`0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\n\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n$x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M. This matches the result from the code output (6.3e-07).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nC) 2.0x10⁻² M\nD) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
