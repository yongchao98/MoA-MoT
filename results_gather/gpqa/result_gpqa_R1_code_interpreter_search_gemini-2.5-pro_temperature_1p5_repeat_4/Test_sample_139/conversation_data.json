    "*   **Step 1: Identify Substance B and Liquid Y.**\n    The melting point of substance B is given as very close to 277 K.\n    277 K = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This value is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly suggests that B is D₂O.\n    Substance B (D₂O) is released when precipitate G is heated. This means G is a deuterated compound, likely a metal deuteroxide that loses D₂O upon heating.\n    The overall reaction involves Substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce precipitate G and gas W. Since the products (G and B) contain deuterium (D), the liquid reactant Y must be the source of deuterium, meaning **Y is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify Gas W.**\n    Gas W is released from the reaction of X and Y (D₂O). The clue is that a molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze possible gases from a reaction involving a deuteride and D₂O.\n    The reaction would produce hydrogen gas. The isotopes could be H or D.\n    *   H₂ molecule: 2 protons (1 per H), 0 neutrons. Protons ≠ Neutrons.\n    *   D₂ molecule: 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). **Protons = Neutrons.** This fits the description.\n    *   HD molecule: 2 protons (1 from H, 1 from D), 1 neutron (from D). Protons ≠ Neutrons.\n    Therefore, **Gas W is D₂ (deuterium gas)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Substance X and Precipitate G.**\n    We know that X reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G.\n    X + D₂O → G (precipitate) + D₂ (gas)\n    The clue \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" and \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents like Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). The \"heavier isotope\" version would be Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    Let's test X = LiAlD₄.\n    The reaction with D₂O is:\n    LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    In this reaction, Aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃, is the precipitate G**. This is consistent because aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a known precipitate. When heated, Al(OD)₃ decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O, releasing D₂O (Substance B), which matches our deductions.\n    If we tested X = NaBD₄, the products would be NaOD and B(OD)₃. Boric acid and its deuterated analog are soluble in water, so no precipitate would form. Thus, X cannot be NaBD₄.\n\n*   **Step 4: Confirm the identity of X with the final clue.**\n    The clue states: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    A keto acid has a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both functional groups to alcohols (or deuterated alcohols, \"deuterols\").\n    R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ → (workup) → R-CH(OD)-CD₂(OD)\n    The final product is a diol (an alcohol with two hydroxyl groups, or in this case, deuteroxyl groups). It contains **two oxygen atoms**. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the final value.**\n    The question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   The instruction \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" means we must account for all atoms of hydrogen and aluminum in the formula.\n    *   We use integer atomic masses for the calculation, as the options are integers. Mass(Deuterium, D) = 2 amu. Mass(Aluminum, ²⁷Al) = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 4 × Mass(D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of aluminum (Al) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 1 × Mass(Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Final Calculation:** The cumulative sum is the sum of these two values.\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
