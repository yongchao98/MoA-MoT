    "This question asks to identify the physical theory among the options that does not require regularization at high energies. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**Regularization at High Energies**\n\nFirst, it is crucial to understand what \"regularization at high energies\" means. In Quantum Field Theory (QFT), when we try to calculate physical quantities like scattering amplitudes, we often use perturbation theory, which can be visualized using Feynman diagrams. These diagrams can include \"loops\" of virtual particles. Integrating over the momenta of these virtual particles often leads to integrals that diverge, i.e., go to infinity. These divergences typically occur when the momentum in the loop goes to infinity, which corresponds to very high energies or, equivalently, very short distances. This is known as an ultraviolet (UV) divergence.\n\n**Regularization** is a mathematical procedure to handle these infinities. It involves temporarily modifying the theory to make the divergent integrals finite. Common regularization schemes include introducing a momentum cutoff, dimensional regularization, or Pauli-Villars regularization. After regularization, a process called **renormalization** is used to absorb the infinities into a redefinition of the physical parameters of the theory (like mass and charge), resulting in finite and physically meaningful predictions.\n\nNow let's examine the options:\n\n*   **B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** and **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: These are both well-established Quantum Field Theories that form the basis of the Standard Model of particle physics. Both QED and QCD are known to have UV divergences in their loop calculations. Therefore, performing calculations in these theories fundamentally requires the use of regularization and renormalization to obtain finite results. They are classic examples of theories that *do* require regularization.\n\n*   **A) Superstring Theory**: This is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity, in a quantum-mechanical way. One of its main motivations and celebrated features is that it is believed to be \"UV-finite.\" Unlike point-particle theories (like QED and QCD), the fundamental objects in string theory are one-dimensional strings. The extended nature of these strings effectively \"smears out\" the interactions at very short distances, which is believed to prevent the UV divergences that plague standard QFTs. While this is a very active area of research and not fully proven in all contexts, the theory is constructed with the aim of not needing regularization.\n\n*   **D) Classical Electrodynamics**: This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, is a *classical* field theory. The concept of \"regularization at high energies\" as described above is a specific solution to a problem arising from *quantum* effects (virtual particle loops). Classical Electrodynamics does not involve quantum loops, Feynman diagrams, or virtual particles. Therefore, it does not suffer from the UV divergences characteristic of quantum field theories and never requires the procedure of regularization in that sense. While classical electrodynamics does have its own infinity problem—the infinite self-energy of an ideal point charge—this is a different kind of problem, often seen as a sign of the breakdown of the classical theory itself at short distances, rather than something addressed by the standard QFT regularization/renormalization machinery. The procedure is simply not part of the theoretical framework of classical electrodynamics.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, QED and QCD definitely require regularization. Superstring theory is a quantum theory specifically proposed to solve this problem and is believed *not* to require regularization. However, Classical Electrodynamics is a theory to which the entire concept of regularization for quantum loop divergences does not apply. It is a classical theory, and the problem that regularization solves is inherently quantum. Therefore, Classical Electrodynamics is the theory that *never* requires regularization at high energies in the sense meant in high-energy physics.\n\n<<<D>>>"
