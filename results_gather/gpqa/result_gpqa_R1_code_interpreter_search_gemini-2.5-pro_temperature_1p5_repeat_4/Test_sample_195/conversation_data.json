    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:** The problem involves a conservative force (Hooke's law), so the total energy of the system is conserved. We need to express the total energy in a relativistic framework.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving with speed $v$ is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. This energy includes the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the relativistic kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$).\n\n3.  **Potential Energy:** The potential energy stored in the spring (which gives rise to the force $F=-kx$) is given by the standard formula $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n4.  **Total System Energy:** The total conserved energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy of the spring field.\n    $E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    This total energy remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n5.  **Analyze the system at two key points:**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum Displacement (Turning Point)**\n        At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops, so its speed is $v=0$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The potential energy is maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position**\n        At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$. Here, the potential energy is zero, $U(0) = 0$. The speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n6.  **Apply Energy Conservation:**\n    The total energy at the maximum displacement must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n7.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:**\n    First, let's solve for $\\gamma_{max}$. Divide the equation by $mc^2$:\n    $\\frac{mc^2}{mc^2} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first square both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Next, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, take the square root of both sides and multiply by $c$ to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
