    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options fit this.\n*   **Mixture:** The solution contains a 1:1 molar ratio of two of these compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   \"Two signals\" implies we are looking at a mixture of two compounds that have different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means the aromatic protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons. This happens when the adjacent carbons are substituted (have no protons).\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\" means that for each molecule of compound A, there is one molecule of compound B, and the number of aromatic protons responsible for signal 1 is equal to the number of aromatic protons responsible for signal 2.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   \"Three signals\" is the total number of unique aliphatic proton environments in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means the signals are from methyl (CH3) groups that are not coupled to other protons. This is typical for methyl groups attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   The \"2:1:1 ratio\" tells us the relative number of protons in each of these three environments.\n\n**2. Analyze the Expected 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound**\n\nLet's predict the number and type of signals for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  CH3 at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  CH3 at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  CH3 at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. However, they are adjacent (ortho) to each other and will couple. This technically produces an AB quartet or a more complex multiplet. But in many cases, especially with low-resolution spectra, if the chemical shift difference is zero, it can be simplified or appear as **one singlet (2H)**. We will proceed with this common simplification.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  CH3 at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  CH3 at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets (6H, 6H)**, which is a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent and will appear as **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 will be a quartet and the CH3 will be a triplet. Since the problem specifies only singlets in the aliphatic region, this compound can be **ruled out**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixtures Given in the Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces:\n*   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's analyze the valid options.\n\n*   **Option A:** Contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is ruled out.\n*   **Option C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals would come from Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) and Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H). This would give a total of up to 5 signals, which does not match the observed 3 signals.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, this produces two singlets with a 1:1 ratio. (This part fits).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four aliphatic signals. This does not match the observed three signals unless there is an accidental overlap of signals.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly produces **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene provides **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**. Prehnitene provides **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   Combining these gives a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This option perfectly matches all the data provided in the problem description without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlaps.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that directly accounts for all the observed signals and their integration ratios in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
