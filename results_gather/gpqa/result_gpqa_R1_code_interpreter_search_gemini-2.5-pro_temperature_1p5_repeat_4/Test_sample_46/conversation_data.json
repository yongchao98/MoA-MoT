    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula:**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double/triple bonds.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) - (0/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct absorption bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the characteristic signature of a primary amine (-NH2). One band corresponds to the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the symmetric N-H stretch. This immediately makes option D (a secondary amide, which would only have one N-H stretch) unlikely.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester carbonyl group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. Amide carbonyls (Options C and D) usually appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹). This suggests the compound is a conjugated ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift (7.0 ppm vs 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the protons, moving them upfield) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the protons, moving them downfield). This finding rules out option C (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is 3-substituted (meta) and would produce a more complex splitting pattern.\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A triplet for 3 protons and a quartet for 2 protons is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The triplet (t) arises from the -CH3 group being split by the adjacent -CH2- group (2 neighbors, n+1=3). The quartet (q) arises from the -CH2- group being split by the adjacent -CH3 group (3 neighbors, n+1=4). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen atom of an ester or ether.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group that we identified from the IR spectrum. The signal is broad due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options:**\n    *   The data points to a molecule with a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2) group, and an ethyl group attached to an ester.\n    *   Let's assemble the pieces: we have a benzene ring with an -NH2 group and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) in a para arrangement. This corresponds to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   Let's check this structure against the data one last time.\n        *   **Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: It has the correct formula C9H11NO2. It has a primary amine and a conjugated ester, matching the IR. It has a para-disubstituted ring, explaining the two doublets in the NMR. The electron-donating -NH2 group shields its ortho protons (at 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its ortho protons (at 8.0 ppm). The signals for the ethyl group and the amine protons are also fully consistent.\n    *   Let's see why other options are wrong:\n        *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: In this ester, the ethyl group would be CH3-CH2-C=O. The -CH2- group would be next to the carbonyl, not the ester oxygen, and would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n        *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This is meta-substituted, which contradicts the NMR's para-substitution pattern. It is also an amide, not an ester, which is less consistent with the IR C=O frequency.\n        *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: This is a secondary amide, which would only show one N-H stretch in the IR, contradicting the two bands observed. It also lacks the signal for a formyl proton (~8-8.5 ppm).\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
