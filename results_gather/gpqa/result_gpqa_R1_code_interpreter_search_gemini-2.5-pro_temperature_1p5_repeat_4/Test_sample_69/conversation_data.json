    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the clues\n\nFirst, we'll list and break down the four clues provided in the problem.\n\n*   **Clue 1:** \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\n    This is a synthesis reaction: A(s) + 8B(g) → C(bright red). The stoichiometry of 1 to 8 is a very strong hint. `A` is a solid, `B` is a gas, and `C` is a bright red product.\n\n*   **Clue 2:** \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    This is another synthesis reaction: C + 2D(g) → E. The product `E` is described as \"extremely hazardous,\" which points towards highly toxic or explosive substances. The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of `E`, implying `E` is a single molecular species.\n\n*   **Clue 3:** \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n    This describes the hydrolysis of C: C + H₂O → A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid). The fact that `A` is reformed suggests it's a stable component, likely the elemental form or a stable oxide of the central element in C. The formation of two different acids, one strong and one weak, is a specific chemical fingerprint.\n\n*   **Clue 4:** \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n    This describes the formation of a solvent `H`: D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent). The 1:1 stoichiometry is key.\n\n### Step 2: Identify B, D, and H\n\nClue 4 provides a good starting point. We need two gases (`B` and `D`) that react 1:1 to form a common solvent (`H`). A classic example of such a reaction is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas, typically over a charcoal catalyst.\n\n*   `CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l)`\n\nPhosgene (`COCl₂`) is a liquid below 8°C and is used as a solvent in some industrial applications. This fits the description of `H`. This gives us two possibilities for `B` and `D`.\n\n*   Possibility 1: `B = CO` and `D = Cl₂`\n*   Possibility 2: `B = Cl₂` and `D = CO`\n\n### Step 3: Identify A and C\n\nLet's test these possibilities with Clue 1: `A(s) + 8B(g) → C(bright red)`.\n\n*   If we test Possibility 2 (`B = Cl₂`), the reaction becomes `A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C`. Finding a solid `A` that reacts with exactly 8 moles of chlorine gas to form a single product is highly unusual and doesn't correspond to common chemical reactions.\n\n*   Let's test Possibility 1 (`B = CO`). The reaction becomes `A(s) + 8CO(g) → C`. This stoichiometry strongly points towards the formation of a metal carbonyl. Specifically, the synthesis of dicobalt octacarbonyl is well-known:\n    `2Co(s) + 8CO(g) → Co₂(CO)₈`\n    This reaction fits the clue perfectly if we consider `A` to be the element Cobalt. Cobalt (`Co`) is a solid. Carbon monoxide (`CO`) is a gas. The stoichiometry is 8 moles of `B` per 1 mole of product `C`. `Co₂(CO)₈` is described as an orange to red-brown crystalline solid, which can be interpreted as \"bright red\" in the context of a puzzle.\n\nSo, we have a consistent set of identifications:\n*   **A** = Cobalt (`Co`)\n*   **B** = Carbon Monoxide (`CO`)\n*   **C** = Dicobalt octacarbonyl (`Co₂(CO)₈`)\n*   **D** = Chlorine (`Cl₂`)\n*   **H** = Phosgene (`COCl₂`)\n\n### Step 4: Verify with Clue 3\n\nLet's check the hydrolysis reaction (Clue 3): `C + H₂O → A + F(strong) + G(weak)`. The hydrolysis of `Co₂(CO)₈` is complex but is known to involve disproportionation, forming species like the strong acid cobalt tetracarbonyl hydride (`HCo(CO)₄`, so F=HCo(CO)₄) and Cobalt(II) ions. Under certain conditions, reformation of cobalt metal (`A`) can occur, and weak acids like carbonic acid (`H₂CO₃`, so G=H₂CO₃) could be formed from CO. While complex, this is plausible for a chemistry puzzle.\n\n### Step 5: Identify E and determine its structure\n\nNow we use Clue 2 to find `E`: `C + 2D(g) → E`.\nSubstituting our identified compounds:\n`Co₂(CO)₈ + 2Cl₂(g) → E`\n\nChlorine is a strong oxidizing agent and will react with the cobalt carbonyl. A plausible reaction involves the oxidation of cobalt from the 0 to the +2 state and the formation of a new complex. Given the stoichiometry, the following reaction is balanced:\n`Co₂(CO)₈ + 2Cl₂ → 2 CoCl₂(CO)₄`\n\nThis reaction produces two molecules of the product. The problem asks for the identity of the product `E`. So, **E = Dichlorotetracarbonylcobalt(II), `CoCl₂(CO)₄`**. This cobalt complex is toxic, fitting the description \"extremely hazardous\".\n\n### Step 6: Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E\n\nThe final step is to determine the point group (molecular symmetry group) of `E = CoCl₂(CO)₄`.\nThis is a six-coordinate complex with an octahedral geometry around the central cobalt atom. The ligands are four carbon monoxide (`CO`) groups and two chlorine (`Cl`) atoms. For a complex with the general formula `MA₄B₂`, two geometric isomers are possible:\n\n1.  **trans-CoCl₂(CO)₄**: The two `Cl` ligands are on opposite sides of the cobalt atom (180° apart). This arrangement has a high degree of symmetry, belonging to the **D₄h** point group.\n2.  **cis-CoCl₂(CO)₄**: The two `Cl` ligands are adjacent to each other (90° apart).\n\nFor `d⁷` `Co(II)` and similar `d⁶` `Fe(II)` complexes like `Fe(CO)₄Cl₂`, electronic and steric factors favor the **cis** isomer. The `cis` arrangement allows for more effective π-backbonding from the metal to the CO ligands. Therefore, `E` is most likely `cis-CoCl₂(CO)₄`.\n\nThe `cis-` isomer has the following symmetry elements:\n*   A C₂ axis that bisects the `Cl-Co-Cl` angle.\n*   Two perpendicular mirror planes (σv) that contain the C₂ axis.\n\nThe set of symmetry operations {E, C₂, σv, σ'v} defines the **C₂v** point group.\n\nThus, the molecular symmetry group of `E` is C₂v.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning process has identified E as cis-CoCl2(CO)4,\n# which has a C2v point group. This corresponds to option D.\n# No computation is needed to arrive at the final answer.\n# The chemical knowledge about structure and stability of metal complexes\n# is sufficient.\n\n# The reasoning is as follows:\n# 1. H is likely COCl2 from D(Cl2) + B(CO) -> H(COCl2) [1:1, solvent]\n# 2. This implies A(s) + 8B(CO) -> C, which points to 2Co + 8CO -> Co2(CO)8.\n# 3. So A=Co, B=CO, C=Co2(CO)8.\n# 4. Reaction C + 2D -> E is Co2(CO)8 + 2Cl2 -> E.\n# 5. A plausible single molecular product type is CoCl2(CO)4. E = CoCl2(CO)4.\n# 6. This is an octahedral complex of type MA4B2. It has cis and trans isomers.\n# 7. For M(CO)4X2 type complexes, the cis-isomer is generally more stable.\n# 8. The point group of cis-MA4B2 is C2v.\n# 9. The point group of trans-MA4B2 is D4h.\n# 10. Assuming the more stable cis-isomer is formed, the point group is C2v.\n# 11. This matches option D.\n\nprint(\"Based on the detailed chemical reasoning, the molecule E is identified as cis-Dichlorotetracarbonylcobalt(II), which has C2v symmetry.\")\nprint(\"The final answer is D.\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a chemical identification puzzle. Let's break it down clue by clue.\n\n**1. Initial Analysis of Clues:**\n\n*   **Clue 4:** `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio. This is a very distinctive reaction. A well-known example is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas:\n    `CO(g) + Cl₂(g) -> COCl₂(l)`\n    Phosgene (COCl₂) fits the description of `H` as a solvent. This gives us two possibilities:\n    *   Possibility 1: `B = CO` and `D = Cl₂`\n    *   Possibility 2: `B = Cl₂` and `D = CO`\n\n*   **Clue 1:** `A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(bright red)`. Let's test our possibilities for `B`.\n    *   If `B = Cl₂`, the reaction is `A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) -> C`. This stoichiometry is highly unusual for a simple reaction.\n    *   If `B = CO`, the reaction is `A(s) + 8CO(g) -> C`. This strongly suggests the formation of a metal carbonyl. A famous reaction with this exact stoichiometry is the synthesis of dicobalt octacarbonyl:\n        `2Co(s) + 8CO(g) -> Co₂(CO)₈`\n    This fits perfectly if we assume `A` is cobalt (`Co`). Cobalt is a solid, `CO` is a gas, and `Co₂(CO)₈` is an orange-red crystalline solid, which matches \"bright red\".\n\n*   **At this point, we have strong candidates:**\n    *   **A** = Cobalt (`Co`)\n    *   **B** = Carbon Monoxide (`CO`)\n    *   **C** = Dicobalt octacarbonyl (`Co₂(CO)₈`)\n    *   **D** = Chlorine (`Cl₂`)\n    *   **H** = Phosgene (`COCl₂`)\n\n*   **Clue 3 (Verification):** `C + H₂O -> A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`.\n    The hydrolysis of `Co₂(CO)₈` is complex but is known to disproportionate, reforming cobalt metal (`A`) and producing cobalt tetracarbonyl hydride (`HCo(CO)₄`), which is a strong acid (`F`). The liberated `CO` can react with water to form carbonic acid (`H₂CO₃`), a weak acid (`G`). This clue is consistent with our identifications.\n\n**2. Identifying Product E:**\n\n*   **Clue 2:** `C + 2D(g) -> E(extremely hazardous)`.\n    Substituting our identified molecules:\n    `Co₂(CO)₈ + 2Cl₂(g) -> E`\n    Chlorine is an oxidizing agent that will cleave the Co-Co bond and oxidize the cobalt atoms. A plausible balanced reaction that forms a single molecular product type is:\n    `Co₂(CO)₈ + 2Cl₂ -> 2CoCl₂(CO)₄`\n    Therefore, the extremely hazardous product `E` is **Dichlorotetracarbonylcobalt(II), `CoCl₂(CO)₄`**.\n\n**3. Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n\n*   `E = CoCl₂(CO)₄` is an octahedral complex of the general formula `MA₄B₂` (where M=Co, A=CO, B=Cl).\n*   This formula has two possible geometric isomers: *cis* and *trans*.\n    *   The ***trans*** **isomer**, where the two Cl atoms are opposite each other, is highly symmetrical and belongs to the **D₄h** point group.\n    *   The ***cis*** **isomer**, where the two Cl atoms are adjacent to each other (at a 90° angle), is less symmetrical.\n\n*   Based on established chemical principles for `d⁷` `Co(II)` and similar metal carbonyl halides, the **cis-isomer is favored** due to better π-backbonding from the metal to the CO ligands.\n\n*   The symmetry elements of `cis-CoCl₂(CO)₄` are:\n    1.  A single two-fold rotation axis (`C₂`) that bisects the Cl-Co-Cl angle.\n    2.  Two perpendicular mirror planes (`σv`) that contain the `C₂` axis.\n*   This set of symmetry elements {E, C₂, σv, σ'v} defines the **C₂v** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C₂v.\n\n<<<D>>>"
