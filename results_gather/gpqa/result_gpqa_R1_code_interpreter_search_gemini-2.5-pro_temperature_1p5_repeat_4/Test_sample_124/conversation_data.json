    "The user is asking for the energy and the number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for the third excited state of a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the Hamiltonian and Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separation of variables in Cartesian coordinates.\n    The Hamiltonian is $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2(x^2+y^2+z^2)$.\n    This can be separated into three independent 1D harmonic oscillators:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial i^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2i^2$ for $i=x,y,z$.\n\n    The energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator in the state $n_i$ is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\n\n    The total energy for the 3D oscillator is the sum of the energies of the three 1D oscillators:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_n = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    Let $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy depends only on the sum $n$, so the energy levels are given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the quantum number $n$.\n    *   **Ground State:** $n=0$. $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $n=1$. $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $n=2$. $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$. $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $n$. These different sets correspond to linearly independent eigenfunctions.\n    We need to find the number of ways to write $n=3$ as the sum of three non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$.\n\n    We can list them out:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) -> 3 states\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n        (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) -> 6 states\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        (1, 1, 1) -> 1 state\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n    Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n\n    A) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 3\n    B) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 10\n    C) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$\n    D) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$\n\n    Option C correctly identifies both the energy and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
