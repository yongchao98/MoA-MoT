    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference, which is considered stationary.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference moving along with the glass.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S). The problem states the glass is moving at velocity `v` in the same direction as the beam.\n    *   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass frame (S'). In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is determined by its index of refraction, `n`. The speed of light in a medium is `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass, as measured within the glass, is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory frame (S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    Classical (Galilean) velocity addition (`u = u' + v`) is not valid at speeds approaching the speed of light. We must use the Einstein (or Lorentz) velocity addition formula. For velocities in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We substitute our specific values into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    This gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both the top and bottom by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option A.\n\nLet's double-check the result using a symbolic computation in Python.\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols used in the formula\nu_prime, v, n, c = sympy.symbols(\"u_prime v n c\")\n\n# State the relativistic velocity addition formula\n# u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)\nu = (u_prime + v) / (1 + u_prime * v / c**2)\n\n# Substitute the values for this specific problem:\n# u_prime (speed of light in the medium) = c/n\n# c (speed of light in vacuum) = 1\nu_final_expression = u.subs([(u_prime, c/n), (c, 1)])\n\n# Simplify the resulting expression\nsimplified_u = sympy.simplify(u_final_expression)\n\n# Print the simplified result\nprint(simplified_u)\n```\n```output\n(n*v + 1)/(n + v)\n```\nThe code confirms that the simplified expression is `(n*v + 1)/(n + v)`, which can be rewritten as `(1 + n*v)/(n + v)`.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem is a classic application of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n**1. Identify the frames of reference and velocities:**\n\n*   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame. We want to find the speed of light in this frame, let's call it `u`.\n*   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame moving with the glass. The glass is moving with velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n*   **Speed of light in the glass (relative to the glass):** The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c/u'`. The problem states `c=1`, therefore the speed of light in the glass, as measured within the glass frame S', is `u' = 1/n`. The light beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass.\n\n**2. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n\nWhen two velocities are in the same direction, the relativistic formula to add them is:\n\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `u` is the velocity of the object (light beam) relative to the stationary frame (lab).\n*   `u'` is the velocity of the object relative to the moving frame (glass).\n*   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the stationary frame.\n*   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n**3. Substitute the given values into the formula:**\n\nWe have:\n*   `u' = 1/n`\n*   `v = v`\n*   `c = 1`\n\nSubstituting these into the formula:\n\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n**4. Simplify the expression:**\n\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n\n`u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\nDistributing `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n`u = (n*(1/n) + n*v) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
