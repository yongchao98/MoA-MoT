    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n    *   The initial state of the 2-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. In this representation, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$. This state is an eigenstate of the operators $L^2$ (total orbital angular momentum squared) and $L_z$ (z-component of total orbital angular momentum).\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both.\n    *   The eigenvalue equation for $L_{iz}$ is $L_{iz}|l_i, m_i\\rangle = m_i\\hbar|l_i, m_i\\rangle$. So, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ means the first electron is found in a state with $m_1 = -1$. Similarly, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ means the second electron is found in a state with $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1, 1, -1\\rangle$. This state is a simultaneous eigenstate of the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n\n2.  **Connect the Coupled and Uncoupled Bases:**\n    The probability of finding the system in the final state $|1, -1, 1, -1\\rangle$ when it was initially in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (projection) of the two states:\n    $P = |\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\n    This inner product $\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n3.  **Apply the Selection Rule for Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n    A fundamental property (a selection rule) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers add up, i.e., $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   For the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the final measured state, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum: $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (because $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n    $\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability is the square of the coefficient:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    **Alternative Reasoning (Conservation Principle):**\n    The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state $|1, -1, 1, -1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. Its eigenvalue is $(m_1 + m_2)\\hbar = (-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n    *   In quantum mechanics, if a system is in an eigenstate of an operator, any measurement of the corresponding observable must yield the corresponding eigenvalue. In this case, a measurement of $L_z$ on the initial state must yield $-1\\hbar$.\n    *   The desired final state corresponds to a total z-component of angular momentum of $-2\\hbar$. Since this value is different from the initial value, it is impossible to transition to this state through this measurement.\n    *   Mathematically, eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Therefore, the inner product $\\langle \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} \\rangle = 0$, and the probability is 0.\n\nTo confirm this result, we can compute the specific Clebsch-Gordan coefficient using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\nfrom sympy import S\n\n# We want to find the probability of measuring m1=-1 and m2=-1\n# when the system is in the state |l=2, m=-1>.\n# This probability is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <l1,m1; l2,m2 | l,m>.\n\n# Quantum numbers of the initial coupled state\nl1 = 1\nl2 = 1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n\n# Quantum numbers of the final measured uncoupled state\nm1 = -1\nm2 = -1\n\n# The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is given by CG(j1, m1, j2, m2, j, m).\n# We use S() to ensure the numbers are treated as SymPy objects for precision.\ncoefficient = CG(S(l1), S(m1), S(l2), S(m2), S(l), S(m)).doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the coefficient's magnitude.\nprobability = abs(coefficient)**2\n\nprint(f\"The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <1,-1; 1,-1 | 2,-1> is: {coefficient}\")\nprint(f\"The probability of this measurement is: {probability}\")\n```\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <1,-1; 1,-1 | 2,-1> is: 0\nThe probability of this measurement is: 0\n\nBoth the theoretical reasoning and the computational check confirm that the probability is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the probability of measuring specific individual z-components of angular momentum for a system that is initially in a coupled angular momentum state.\n\n1.  **Identify Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis, where the total angular momentum is well-defined. The state is $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n        *   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ because the electrons are in p-orbitals.\n        *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n        *   $m = -1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This means the eigenvalue of the total $L_z$ operator is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n    *   The measurement is of the individual z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of a specific outcome.\n    *   The desired final state corresponds to measuring an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n        *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ means the first electron is found in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n        *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ means the second electron is found in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   So, the final state, described in the uncoupled basis, is $|l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1, 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Relate the States and Calculate Probability:**\n    The probability of finding the system in the final state $|1, -1, 1, -1\\rangle$ after a measurement, when it was initially in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, is the square of the magnitude of the inner product of these two states:\n    $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l_1, l_2, l, m \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\n    This inner product, $\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$, is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n3.  **Apply the Selection Rule (Conservation of Angular Momentum):**\n    A fundamental principle in the coupling of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. That is, the operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n\n    This leads to a strict selection rule for the quantum numbers: a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n    Let's check this rule for our specific case:\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum of the individual quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    We compare the required total $m$ with the sum of the individual $m_i$:\n    $m = -1$\n    $m_1 + m_2 = -2$\n    Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the condition is not met.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Because the selection rule is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n    $\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\n    Intuitively, the initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. The final measured state would have a total z-component of $(-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Since the z-component of angular momentum must be conserved for the isolated system, it's impossible to find the system in a state with a different total $L_z$. The probability of this outcome is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
