    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) of a series of monosubstituted benzenes. The goal is to arrange these substances in order of the increasing yield of the para-monobromo derivative. The weight fraction of the yield is directly related to the molar percentage yield, as the molar masses of the products are reasonably similar. Therefore, we can focus on ordering by the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the Substituents\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is crucial. We need to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They are typically activating groups (electron-donating) or halogens.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (methyl)**: Activating group (+I effect, hyperconjugation). Ortho, para-director.\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (ethyl)**: Activating group (+I effect, hyperconjugation). Ortho, para-director.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro)**: Deactivating group (-I effect > +M effect) but is an ortho, para-director due to resonance (+M effect) stabilizing the intermediate carbocation.\n*   **Meta-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing).\n    *   4) **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating group (-I, -M effects). Meta-director.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (ethyl carboxylate)**: Deactivating group (-I, -M effects). Meta-director.\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxylic acid)**: Deactivating group (-I, -M effects). Meta-director.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Grouping\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will form very little para-isomer, while those with ortho, para-directing groups will form a significant amount of the para-isomer. Therefore, the final ordered list will have the meta-directing substances first, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances.\n\nOrder: (Group of 2, 4, 6) < (Group of 1, 3, 5)\n\n### Step 4: Rank the Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6)\nFor meta-directors, the main product is the meta-isomer. The para-isomer is formed in very small amounts. The selectivity for the meta position increases with the electron-withdrawing (deactivating) strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group will lead to a lower yield of the disfavored para and ortho isomers.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the group that is most strongly deactivated (-NO2) will produce the least amount of para-isomer. The order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\n### Step 5: Rank the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5)\nFor these substances, both ortho and para isomers are major products. The ratio between them (and thus the percentage yield of the para-isomer) depends on a combination of electronic and steric effects. The incoming electrophile is a bromine atom, which is relatively large, so steric hindrance is an important factor.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5)**: The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the attack at the adjacent ortho positions more significantly, leading to a higher proportion of the product being the para-isomer. Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene.\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. Alkyl Groups (1, 5)**: The chloro group is a special case. It deactivates the ring through its strong inductive effect (-I), but directs ortho/para via its resonance effect (+M). The inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic factor strongly disfavors ortho substitution, leading to a very high selectivity for the para position. Experimental data confirms that the para/ortho ratio for chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for toluene or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Approximate para-yields in bromination: Toluene (~67%), Ethylbenzene (~70%), Chlorobenzene (~88%).\n\nBased on this, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\nC6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3)\n\n### Step 6: Combine the Rankings\nNow, we combine the rankings from the two groups:\n\n(Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
