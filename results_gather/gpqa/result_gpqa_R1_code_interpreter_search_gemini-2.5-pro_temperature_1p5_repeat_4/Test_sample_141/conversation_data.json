    "An arbitrary density matrix $\\rho$ for a single qubit can be written in the form:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nwhere:\n*   $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix: $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is the Bloch vector, which represents the geometrical position of the qubit state in the Bloch sphere.\n*   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices:\n    *   $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe components of the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ can be calculated from the density matrix using the formula:\n$r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_i)$\n\nFirst, let's write the given density matrix in its matrix form.\nThe basis states are:\n$|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe outer products are:\n$|0\\rangle\\langle0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( |0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1| \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} I$\n\nThis is the density matrix for the maximally mixed state.\n\nNow, we calculate the components of the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$:\n\n1.  **Calculate $r_x$:**\n    $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(0 + 0) = 0$\n\n2.  **Calculate $r_y$:**\n    $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(0 + 0) = 0$\n\n3.  **Calculate $r_z$:**\n    $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + (-1)) = 0$\n\nThus, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\nThis corresponds to the origin (center) of the Bloch sphere.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) r=(0,0,1) corresponds to the pure state $|0\\rangle$.\nB) r=(1,1,1) is not a valid state as its length squared is $1^2+1^2+1^2=3 > 1$.\nC) r=(0,0,0) is the maximally mixed state, which matches our calculation.\nD) r=(1,1,0) is not a valid state as its length squared is $1^2+1^2+0^2=2 > 1$.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
