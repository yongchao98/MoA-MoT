    "*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n\n    1.  **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is, by definition, a planet with the same average density as Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    2.  **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** This planet's density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is virtually the same as Earth's density.\n\n    3.  **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** The key concept here is gravitational compression. A planet's density is determined by its composition and the pressure exerted by its own gravity. For planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have stronger self-gravity. This increased gravitational force compresses the planet's material more tightly, resulting in a higher average density. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with Earth's composition will be significantly denser than Earth.\n\n    4.  **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as in (c), a planet that is less massive will have weaker self-gravity. This leads to less compression of its material compared to Earth. Consequently, its average density will be lower than Earth's density.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n\n    *   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n    *   Planet (c) has a density *greater than* 5.51 g/cm³ due to higher mass and compression.\n    *   Planet (d) has a density *less than* 5.51 g/cm³ due to lower mass and less compression.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    The planet described in option (c) is the most massive planet with a rocky composition among the choices. Its superior mass leads to the greatest gravitational compression, and therefore, it will have the highest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
