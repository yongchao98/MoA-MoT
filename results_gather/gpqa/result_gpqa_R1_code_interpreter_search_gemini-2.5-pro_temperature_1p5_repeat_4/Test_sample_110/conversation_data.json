    "**Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction, a conjugate addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n2.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n3.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion.\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5) and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can *only* occur at C6. The base removes the proton from C6, forming the corresponding enolate.\n4.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The C6 of the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the carbon further from the ester group). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n5.  **Protonation:** The resulting intermediate anion is protonated (likely by abstracting a proton from the solvent or tert-butanol, which is formed in the first step) to yield the final product.\n6.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The product has the ethyl propanoate group (-CH₂CH₂COOEt) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name the final product, we must identify the principal functional group according to IUPAC nomenclature rules. The ester group has higher priority than the ketone group.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate. The main chain is the 3-carbon ester chain.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring system is treated as a substituent on carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the substituent, the point of attachment on the ring is designated as locant 1. This is the carbon that was C6 in the starting ketone.\n    *   We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the other substituents (oxo group, ethyl group, methyl groups).\n    *   Following the connectivity from the starting material:\n        *   New C1 (the attachment point, formerly C6) has a methyl group.\n        *   New C2 (formerly C1) has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   New C3 (formerly C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering from C1 towards the oxo group at C2 gives the locant set {1, 2, 3, 3} for the methyl, oxo, ethyl, and methyl groups respectively.\n    *   The name of the substituent is **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Thus, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   Comparing this with the options, this matches the name for A in options C and D. The name for A in options A and B (`...3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl...`) is structurally inconsistent with the outcome of this reaction.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n2.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n3.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The α-protons on the carbon bearing the nitro group are acidic (pKa ≈ 10). The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n    *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + KOH  ⇌  [CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻ K⁺ + H₂O`\n4.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile (the carbon bonded to the methyl group). A new C-C bond is formed.\n    *   `[CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻ + CH₃CH=CHCN  →  CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH⁻CN`\n5.  **Protonation:** The intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n    *   `CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH⁻CN + H₂O → CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH₂CN + OH⁻`\n6.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   Let's identify the structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the molecule is named as a substituted nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is identified. The chain runs from the nitrile carbon through the main backbone to the terminal methyl of the ethyl group.\n    *   `CN(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(CH₃)(C3)-CH(NO₂)(C4)-CH₂(C5)-CH₃(C6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   There is a methyl group (-CH₃) on C3 and a nitro group (-NO₂) on C4.\n    *   Alphabetically, the name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms in the product is 7 (3 from 1-nitropropane and 4 from but-2-enenitrile). Our named product, `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile` (6 in chain + 1 in methyl group), has 7 carbons.\n    *   The alternative name for B in the options is `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`. A butanenitrile with two methyl groups would have a total of 4 + 2 = 6 carbons, which is inconsistent with the reactants. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
