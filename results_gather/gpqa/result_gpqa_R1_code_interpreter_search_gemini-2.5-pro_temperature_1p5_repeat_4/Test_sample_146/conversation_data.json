    "This is a particle physics problem involving an annihilation process. To solve it, we need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    The process begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of annihilation where massive amounts of rest energy are converted into kinetic energy, the initial kinetic energy of a \"slowly moving\" particle is negligible. Therefore, we can assume the initial system of the proton and antiproton is effectively at rest. This means the total initial momentum is zero, and the total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$): ~938.3 MeV\n    *   Rest mass energy of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$): ~938.3 MeV (same as a proton)\n    *   Total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) = $m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Total initial momentum ($P_{initial}$): 0\n\n2.  **Understand the Final State:**\n    The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. They all have the same mass, with a rest mass energy given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. After the annihilation, these four particles will move away with some velocity, carrying the energy released from the annihilation as kinetic energy.\n\n    *   Number of final particles ($n$): 4\n    *   Rest mass energy of one particle A ($m_A c^2$): 300 MeV\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. The four particles must fly off in directions such that the vector sum of their momenta is zero.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Energy Equation:**\n    The energy of each final particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    Since all four final particles have the same mass and, by symmetry (to conserve momentum), they will share the energy equally, they will all have the same speed, $v$.\n    The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n    Equating initial and final energies:\n    $m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Velocity:**\n    First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    $1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n    Now, we can find the velocity ($v$) from the definition of $\\gamma$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n    Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4456}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\n    Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.7688c$. This value is closest to 0.77c.\n\nFor a more precise calculation, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_a_c2 = 300      # Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# Total initial energy (annihilation at rest)\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Total final energy\n# E_final = 4 * gamma * m_a_c2\n# From E_initial = E_final, we can find gamma\ngamma = E_initial / (4 * m_a_c2)\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) -> beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\n# The velocity is beta * c\nprint(f\"{beta:.2f}c\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** This problem involves a particle annihilation process. The fundamental principles that govern such interactions are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of high-energy physics where rest mass energies are converted to kinetic energy, the initial kinetic energy of a slowly moving particle is negligible compared to the rest mass energy.\n    *   Therefore, we can approximate the initial system as being at rest.\n    *   **Initial Momentum ($P_{initial}$):** Since the system is effectively at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. $P_{initial} = 0$.\n    *   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton. The rest mass of a proton is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton.\n        *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n        *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state:**\n    *   The final system consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   The particles $A^+$ and $A^-$ have the same mass $m_A$, with a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   **Final Momentum ($P_{final}$):** By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. $P_{final} = 0$. This means the four particles must fly off in directions such that their momentum vectors sum to zero.\n    *   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the four resulting particles. The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Due to the conservation of momentum and the symmetry of the products, the released energy will be shared equally among the four particles. Therefore, they will all have the same speed ($v$) and the same Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    *   $1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\n5.  **Solve for the velocity (v):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Next, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4456}}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.769c$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the options:**\n    The calculated velocity is approximately $0.77c$. This matches option D.\n\nThe calculation was previously verified using a python script which gave the result `0.77c`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
