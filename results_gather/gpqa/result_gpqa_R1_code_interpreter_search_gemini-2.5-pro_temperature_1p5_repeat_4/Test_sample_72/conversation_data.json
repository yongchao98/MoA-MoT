    "This problem requires us to calculate two quantities in the context of special relativity: the relative speed between two objects and the total energy of the system.\n\n**Part 1: Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThe two astronauts are moving in the same direction with relativistic speeds. To find the relative speed of one with respect to the other, we must use the Lorentz velocity addition/subtraction formula. Let the laboratory frame be S, and the frames of the two astronauts be S' (for astronaut 1) and S'' (for astronaut 2).\n\nThe velocities of the astronauts in frame S are:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$ (velocity of astronaut 1)\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$ (velocity of astronaut 2)\n\nWe want to find the velocity of astronaut 2 as observed by astronaut 1, which we denote as $v_{21}$. The formula is:\n$v_{21} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n$v_{21} = \\frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{-0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{21} = -\\frac{1}{7}c \\approx -0.1428c$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that from astronaut 1's perspective, astronaut 2 is moving in the negative x-direction (i.e., falling behind). The magnitude of this relative speed is:\n$v_{rel} = |v_{21}| = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.14c$\n\n**Part 2: Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ moving at speed $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Rest mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Speed: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Rest mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Speed: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)(3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n\nUsing the approximation $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 2 \\times 1.732) mc^2 = (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} = 5.96 mc^2$.\n\nLet's use a Python script for a more precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Velocities in terms of c\nv1_c = 0.6\nv2_c = 0.5\n# Masses in terms of m\nm1_m = 2\nm2_m = 3\n\n# --- Calculation of Relative Speed ---\n# Using the relativistic velocity subtraction formula: v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - v1*v2/c^2)\nv_rel_numerator = v2_c - v1_c\nv_rel_denominator = 1 - (v1_c * v2_c)\nv_rel_c = v_rel_numerator / v_rel_denominator\n\n# The magnitude of the relative speed\nv_rel_magnitude = abs(v_rel_c)\n\n# --- Calculation of Total Energy ---\n# Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# Energy E = gamma * m * c^2\n\n# Astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1_c**2)\nE1_mc2 = gamma1 * m1_m  # Energy in units of mc^2\n\n# Astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2_c**2)\nE2_mc2 = gamma2 * m2_m  # Energy in units of mc^2\n\n# Total Energy\nE_total_mc2 = E1_mc2 + E2_mc2\n\nprint(f\"The magnitude of the relative speed is {v_rel_magnitude:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"The total energy of the system is {E_total_mc2:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe magnitude of the relative speed is 0.14c\nThe total energy of the system is 5.96mc^2\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculations show that the relative speed is approximately $0.14c$ and the total energy is $5.96mc^2$.

    "This problem is divided into two parts: finding the relative speed of the two astronauts and finding the total energy of the system. We will solve each part using the principles of special relativity.\n\n### **Part 1: Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThe two astronauts are moving in the same direction (positive x-direction) in a stationary reference frame. To find the relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other, we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let the velocities of the two astronauts in the stationary frame be $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n\nThe relative velocity of astronaut 2 as seen by astronaut 1 ($v_{21}$) is given by the formula:\n$$v_{21} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$v_{21} = \\frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -\\frac{1}{7}c$$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that from astronaut 1's perspective, astronaut 2 is moving in the negative direction. The magnitude of this relative speed is:\n$$v_{rel} = |v_{21}| = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$$\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is $0.14c$.\n\n### **Part 2: Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ moving at a relativistic speed $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$$\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Rest mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Speed: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$$\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Rest mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Speed: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)(3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$$\n\n**Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$):**\nThe total energy is the sum of the individual energies:\n$$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$$\nUsing the approximation $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n$$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 2 \\times 1.732) mc^2 = (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$$\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is $5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe relative speed is approximately $0.14c$, and the total energy is $5.96 mc^2$. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
