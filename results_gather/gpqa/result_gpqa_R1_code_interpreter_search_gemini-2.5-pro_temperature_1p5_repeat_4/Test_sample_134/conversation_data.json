    "This problem requires identifying the kinematically allowed decay channels for a boson X with a given mass.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Interaction and Decay Process\n\nThe interaction between the boson X and fermions is described by the Lagrangian:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\left(y\\right)=-\\lambda{f}\\bar{\\psi}{f}\\left(y\\right)\\left(\\upsilon+X\\left(y\\right)\\right)\\psi_{f}\\left(y\\right) $$\nThis Lagrangian contains an interaction term of the form $-\\lambda_f X(y) \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) \\psi_f(y)$, which describes the coupling of the boson X to a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$). This interaction allows the boson X to decay into any fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$) for which the decay is kinematically possible.\n\n### 2. Kinematic Condition for Decay\n\nA decay of a parent particle into daughter particles is kinematically allowed if and only if the mass of the parent particle is greater than the sum of the masses of the daughter particles.\n\nFor the decay process $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$, the parent particle is X, and the daughter particles are a fermion ($f$) and its corresponding antifermion ($\\bar{f}$).\n\nLet $m_X$ be the mass of the boson X, and $m_f$ be the mass of the fermion $f$. Since a particle and its antiparticle have identical masses ($m_{\\bar{f}} = m_f$), the kinematic condition is:\n$$ m_X > m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\n$$ m_X > 2m_f $$\n\n### 3. Applying the Condition with Given Values\n\nWe are given the mass of the boson X:\n$$ m_X = 6 \\text{ GeV} $$\nThe condition for an allowed decay channel $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$ becomes:\n$$ 6 \\text{ GeV} > 2m_f $$\nor equivalently,\n$$ m_f < 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\nWe need to find all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) whose mass is less than 3 GeV.\n\n### 4. Checking Fermion Masses\n\nLet's list the masses of the fundamental fermions and check them against the condition $m_f < 3$ GeV.\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   Up quark ($u$): $m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0022 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is **allowed**.\n*   Down quark ($d$): $m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0047 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is **allowed**.\n*   Strange quark ($s$): $m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV} = 0.095 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.095 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is **allowed**.\n*   Charm quark ($c$): $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.27 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is **allowed**.\n*   Bottom quark ($b$): $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $4.18 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **forbidden**.\n*   Top quark ($t$): $m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $173 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **forbidden**.\n\n**Leptons:**\n*   Electron ($e$): $m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.000511 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n*   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_{\\mu} \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.1057 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n*   Tau lepton ($\\tau$): $m_{\\tau} \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.777 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n\n### 5. Final List of Allowed Decays\n\nCombining all the kinematically allowed decay channels, we get:\n$X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, s\\bar{s}, c\\bar{c}, e^{+}e^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\n\nNow we compare this list with the given choices:\n*   **A) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    This list exactly matches our derived list of allowed decays.\n*   **B) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    This is incorrect because it includes the forbidden decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ and omits the allowed decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$.\n*   **C) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    This is incorrect as it includes $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ and omits $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ and $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$.\n*   **D) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    This is incorrect because it includes the forbidden decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
