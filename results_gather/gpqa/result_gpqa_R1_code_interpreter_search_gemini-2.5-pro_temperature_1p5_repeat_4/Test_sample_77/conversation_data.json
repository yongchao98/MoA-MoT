    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concept:**\n    The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) produced by a moving point charge. This is a classic problem in electromagnetism, and the solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key feature is that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, `c`, so the potential at a point `r` at time `t` depends on the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `t_r`.\n\n2.  **Define the Key Variables:**\n    *   `q`: The point charge.\n    *   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   `t`: The time of observation.\n    *   `t_r`: The retarded time, which is the time the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach point `r` at time `t`.\n    *   The relationship between `t` and `t_r` is given by the time it takes light to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `r`. This distance is `|r - s(t_r)|`. Therefore, `t - t_r = |r - s(t_r)| / c`.\n    *   `d`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point. So, `d = r - s(t_r)`. Its magnitude is `d = |d|`.\n    *   Using this notation, the retarded time condition becomes `t - t_r = d/c`.\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = t_r`.\n    *   `ε₀`: Permittivity of free space.\n    *   `μ₀`: Permeability of free space.\n    *   `c`: Speed of light in vacuum. We know that `c² = 1 / (ε₀μ₀)`.\n\n3.  **Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:**\n    The general expressions for potentials from time-varying charge and current distributions are the retarded potentials:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t_r) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t_r) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    where `t_r = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\n    For a point charge `q` at `s(t)`, the charge density is `ρ(r', t') = qδ³(r' - s(t'))` and the current density is `J(r', t') = qv(t')δ³(r' - s(t'))`.\n\n    Substituting these into the integrals and evaluating them (which is a non-trivial step involving a change of variables and properties of the Dirac delta function) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The standard results are:\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\n4.  **Manipulate the Standard Form to Match the Options:**\n    Let's examine the denominator of the standard form: `d - (d·v)/c`.\n    We can factor out `1/c` from this expression:\n    `d - (d·v)/c = (1/c) * (dc - d·v)`\n\n    Now substitute this back into the potential formulas:\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{(1/c)(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(1/c)(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's check our derived expressions against the choices provided:\n\n    *   A) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀r), A(r,t) = (v/c²)V(r,t)`: This is incorrect. V is the static Coulomb potential, which doesn't account for retardation or the charge's motion.\n    *   B) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀r), A(r,t) = (v²/c²)V(r,t)`: Incorrect for the same reason as A, and the relation between A and V is also wrong.\n    *   C) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d·v)), A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π(dc - d·v))`: These expressions exactly match our manipulated formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀(dc + d·v)), A(r,t) = μqc v / (4π(dc + d·v))`: This is incorrect due to the `+` sign in the denominator. The sign must be `-`. The negative sign ensures that the potential is larger when the charge is moving towards the observer (`d·v > 0`), which is physically correct.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Option C correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge using the given notation. We can also verify that `A = (v/c²)V` holds for option C:\n    $\\dfrac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v} / (4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}))}{qc / (4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}))} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} = \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\vec{v}$.\n    So, $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. This relationship is a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>"
