    "This problem requires us to compare the magnitudes of two distinct energy values related to the Hydrogen atom:\n1.  The energy of an electronic transition, $\\Delta E$, corresponding to a specific wavelength.\n2.  The energy of the paramagnetic coupling term, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, due to an external magnetic field.\n\nWe will calculate each of these quantities and then compare their orders of magnitude. For the calculations, we will use the following physical constants:\n*   Planck's constant, $h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s}$\n*   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3.0 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}$\n*   Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}$\n*   Elementary charge, $e \\approx 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C}$, for converting Joules to electron-volts (eV).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$\n\nThe energy of a photon, and thus the energy of the atomic transition that emits or absorbs it, is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\n$\n\\Delta E = h \\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\n$\n\nThe problem gives the wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$.\nPlugging in the values for $h$ and $c$:\n\n$\n\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}\n$\n\nFor a more intuitive comparison, let's convert this energy to electron-volts (eV):\n\n$\n\\Delta E \\, (\\text{in eV}) = \\frac{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}\n$\n\nThis energy corresponds to the Balmer beta ($H_{\\beta}$) transition in the Hydrogen atom, from the $n=4$ to the $n=2$ energy level.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Term $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term describes the interaction energy of an atom's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$. This is known as the Zeeman effect. The interaction Hamiltonian is $H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\n\nThe problem mentions the orbital magnetic quantum number, $m$ (which we denote as $m_l$ to be explicit), indicating we should consider the energy contribution from the orbital angular momentum. The energy shift due to the orbital magnetic moment is given by:\n\n$\n\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m_l \\mu_B B\n$\n\nWhere:\n*   $m_l$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem specifies \"small values of m,\" so we can take $m_l=1$ as a representative non-zero value.\n*   $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, the fundamental unit for the magnetic moment of an electron.\n*   $B$ is the strength of the magnetic field, given as $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$.\n\nLet's calculate the value of $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$ for $m_l=1$:\n\n$\n\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}\n$\n\nAgain, converting to electron-volts:\n\n$\n\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\, (\\text{in eV}) = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV}} \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}\n$\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Orders of Magnitude\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   $\\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J} \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nTo compare them, we can find their ratio:\n\n$\n\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}}{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}\n$\n\nThe ratio is a very small number, on the order of $10^{-5}$. This clearly shows that the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of the electronic transition.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
