The weight increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H2O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO2 or SO2. The weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O2) via the reaction 2Cu + O2 → 2CuO. The weight increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted. Thus, the mass of O2 is 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O2 = 32 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O2 = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains. The volume is given at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant (so it's not water vapor), limewater (not acidic), or hot copper (not oxygen). The most plausible chemically inert gas formed from salts containing nitrogen (implied by N-O anions) is dinitrogen (N2).\n\n**Step 2: Verify the composition of the products using the Law of Conservation of Mass.**\n\nLet's assume Gas C is N2 and check if the total mass of the products equals the initial mass of the reactants.\n*   Mass of H2O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N2 = moles × molar mass = 0.10 mol × 28 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g), which strongly supports our identification of the products as H2O, O2, and N2.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, that decomposes upon heating to produce N2, O2, and H2O. The elements present in the salts must be Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. These are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoanions.\n\nLet's consider the thermal decomposition reactions of common ammonium salts:\n1.  **Ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2):** NH4NO2(s) → N2(g) + 2H2O(g). This reaction produces N2 and H2O.\n2.  **Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3):** This salt has multiple decomposition pathways. While the low-temperature decomposition yields N2O and H2O, a higher temperature (around 200-260°C) or catalyzed decomposition follows the reaction: 2NH4NO3(s) → 2N2(g) + O2(g) + 4H2O(g). This reaction produces all three identified products: N2, O2, and H2O.\n\nLet's hypothesize that Salt A is **NH4NO2** and Salt B is **NH4NO3**, and they decompose according to the reactions above.\nSince the mixture is equimolar, let's say it contains *n* moles of A and *n* moles of B.\n\n*   From *n* mol of NH4NO2: we get *n* mol of N2 and 2*n* mol of H2O.\n*   From *n* mol of NH4NO3: we get *n* mol of N2, 0.5*n* mol of O2, and 2*n* mol of H2O.\n\nNow, let's sum the products from the mixture:\n*   Total moles of H2O = 2*n* (from A) + 2*n* (from B) = 4*n*\n*   Total moles of O2 = 0.5*n* (from B only)\n*   Total moles of N2 = *n* (from A) + *n* (from B) = 2*n*\n\nWe can solve for *n* using the experimentally determined moles of any of the products. Let's use O2:\n*   Total moles of O2 = 0.5*n* = 0.025 mol\n*   Solving for *n*: n = 0.025 / 0.5 = 0.05 mol.\n\nNow, let's check if n = 0.05 mol is consistent with the other products:\n*   Predicted moles of N2 = 2*n* = 2 × 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (Matches experiment)\n*   Predicted moles of H2O = 4*n* = 4 × 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (Matches experiment)\n\nThe hypothesis is consistent. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH4NO2 and 0.05 mol of NH4NO3.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH4NO2):**\n    *   Number of atoms = (1 N in NH4+) + (4 H in NH4+) + (1 N in NO2-) + (2 O in NO2-)\n    *   Total atoms in NH4NO2 = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH4NO3):**\n    *   Number of atoms = (1 N in NH4+) + (4 H in NH4+) + (1 N in NO3-) + (3 O in NO3-)\n    *   Total atoms in NH4NO3 = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in salts A and B:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n```python\n# Calculations to confirm the reasoning steps.\n\n# Step 1: Moles of products\n# Molar masses\nM_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nM_O2 = 31.998   # g/mol\nM_N2 = 28.014   # g/mol\n# Given data\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nmass_O2 = 0.80   # g\nvol_gas_C_STP = 2.24 # L\n\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nmoles_O2 = mass_O2 / M_O2\nmoles_N2 = vol_gas_C_STP / 22.4 # Assuming Gas C is N2\n\n# Step 2: Solve for equimolar amount 'n'\n# From the stoichiometry: moles_O2 = 0.5 * n\nn = moles_O2 / 0.5\n\n# Step 3: Count atoms\n# Salt A: NH4NO2 has 2 Nitrogen, 4 Hydrogen, 2 Oxygen\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n# Salt B: NH4NO3 has 2 Nitrogen, 4 Hydrogen, 3 Oxygen\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Calculated equimolar amount n: {n:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Check moles N2: 2*n = {2*n:.3f} mol (Experimental: {moles_N2:.3f} mol)\")\nprint(f\"Check moles H2O: 4*n = {4*n:.3f} mol (Experimental: {moles_H2O:.3f} mol)\")\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in NH4NO2 and NH4NO3 is: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n**1. Identify the products and their quantities:**\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** Absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** Absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂). The weight did not change, so no acidic gases were produced.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Reacts with oxygen (O₂) via 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of O₂.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas volume is 2.24 L at STP. This gas did not react with the previous reagents.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   The total mass of the products is 3.60 g (H₂O) + 0.80 g (O₂) + (0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol N₂) = 3.60 + 0.80 + 2.80 = 7.20 g. This equals the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming that Gas C is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Identify the salts A and B:**\nThe decomposition produces H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This points to ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\nLet's consider the decomposition of two such salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂): NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃): 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nLet the mixture contain *n* moles of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and *n* moles of salt B (NH₄NO₃) since it is an equimolar mixture.\n\n**3. Set up stoichiometric equations:**\n*   From *n* mol of NH₄NO₂, we get: *n* mol N₂ and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n*   From *n* mol of NH₄NO₃, we get: *n* mol N₂ (from 0.5*n* of the 2-mol reaction), 0.5*n* mol O₂, and 2*n* mol H₂O.\n\n**Total moles of products:**\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2*n + 2*n = 4*n\n*   Total moles of O₂ = 0 + 0.5*n = 0.5*n\n*   Total moles of N₂ = n + n = 2*n\n\n**4. Solve for *n*:**\nWe can use any of the product quantities to find *n*. Using oxygen is the most direct:\n*   Total moles of O₂ = 0.5*n = 0.025 mol\n*   *n* = 0.025 / 0.5 = 0.05 mol\n\nLet's verify this value of *n* with the other products:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = 2*n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches the experimental value)\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 4*n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches the experimental value)\n\nThe identities of the salts are confirmed as **NH₄NO₂** (Salt A) and **NH₄NO₃** (Salt B).\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms:**\nThe question asks for the sum of the number of atoms in the chemical formulas of Salt A and Salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>"
