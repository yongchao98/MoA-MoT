    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe main goal is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a specific Schrödinger cat state. The measure for nG is given as a form of relative entropy.\n\n**2. Analyze the Given Information:**\n*   **State:** The Schrödinger cat state is `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`.\n*   **Parameters:** `phi = -pi / 4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n*   **Normalization constant:** `N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2))`.\n*   **Non-Gaussianity Measure:** `del_b = [trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))]`.\n*   `rho` is the density matrix of the state `|psi>`, i.e., `rho = |psi><psi|`.\n*   `tau` is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as `rho`.\n\n**3. Simplify the Non-Gaussianity Measure:**\nThe measure is `del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`.\nThis can be rewritten in terms of von Neumann entropy, `S(A) = -trace(A*ln(A))`.\nSo, `del_b = -S(rho) - (-S(tau)) = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n\nThe state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. The von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`.\nThis simplifies the non-Gaussianity measure to: `del_b = S(tau)`.\n\nOur task is now reduced to finding the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`.\n\n**4. Characterize the Reference Gaussian State `tau`:**\nA Gaussian state is fully defined by its first moments (mean displacement vector) and second moments (covariance matrix). The state `tau` must have the same moments as `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moments:** We need to calculate `d_q = <psi|q|psi>` and `d_p = <psi|p|psi>`, where `q` and `p` are the position and momentum quadrature operators. For the given state (`phi = -pi/4`, an \"odd\" cat state), the expectation values of the annihilation `<a>` and creation `<a†>` operators are zero. Since `q` and `p` are linear combinations of `a` and `a†`, their expectation values are also zero.\n    *   `d_q = 0`, `d_p = 0`.\n    This means the reference Gaussian state `tau` is centered at the origin of the phase space.\n\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance Matrix):** The covariance matrix `V` has elements `V_ij = (1/2)<{r_i - d_i, r_j - d_j}>`, where `r = (q, p)`. Since the means `d_i` are zero, `V_qq = <q^2>`, `V_pp = <p^2>`, and `V_qp = V_pq = (1/2)<qp+pq>`.\n    For an odd cat state, the covariance matrix is diagonal (`V_qp = 0`). The diagonal elements are:\n    *   `V_qq = <q^2> = <n> + 0.5 + alpha^2`\n    *   `V_pp = <p^2> = <n> + 0.5 - alpha^2`\n    where `<n>` is the mean photon number of the state `|psi>`. For an odd cat state, it is given by `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Entropy of `tau`, `S(tau)`:**\nThe von Neumann entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state `tau` is given by the formula:\n`S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\nwhere `nu` is the symplectic eigenvalue of the covariance matrix `V`. For a single mode, `nu = sqrt(det(V))`.\n\n*   **Calculate `det(V)`:**\n    `det(V) = V_qq * V_pp = (<n> + 0.5 + alpha^2) * (<n> + 0.5 - alpha^2)`\n    `det(V) = (<n> + 0.5)^2 - (alpha^2)^2`\n\n*   **Substitute `<n>`:**\n    `det(V) = (alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2) + 0.5)^2 - alpha^4`\n\nNow we have all the pieces to perform the calculation with the given values.\n\n**6. Numerical Calculation:**\n*   `alpha = 0.5`\n*   `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n*   `alpha^4 = 0.0625`\n*   Calculate `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`.\n*   Calculate `nu = sqrt((<n> + 0.5)^2 - 0.0625)`.\n*   Calculate `S(tau)` using the formula above.\n\nThis multi-step calculation is best performed with a script to maintain precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# This script calculates the non-Gaussianity of a specific Schrödinger cat state.\n# The state is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N\n# with phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.\n# This corresponds to an \"odd cat state\".\n# The non-Gaussianity (nG) is measured by the relative entropy:\n# nG = S(tau) - S(rho)\n# where rho is the density matrix of the cat state, and tau is a reference\n# Gaussian state with the same first and second moments.\n\n# Since the cat state is a pure state, its von Neumann entropy S(rho) is 0.\n# Therefore, nG = S(tau).\n\n# The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state tau is given by:\n# S(tau) = (nu + 0.5) * ln(nu + 0.5) - (nu - 0.5) * ln(nu - 0.5)\n# where nu is the symplectic eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of tau.\n# For a single mode, nu = sqrt(det(V)).\n\n# The covariance matrix V is determined by the second moments of rho, as the\n# first moments (mean displacements) are zero for this state.\n# The elements of V are related to the expectation values <n> (mean photon number)\n# and <a^2>.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nThe goal is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a specific Schrödinger cat state. The measure for nG is the relative entropy `del_b` between the state's density matrix `rho` and a reference Gaussian state's density matrix `tau`.\n\n**2. Analyze and Simplify the Non-Gaussianity Measure**\n\nThe non-Gaussianity measure is given by:\n`del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`\n\nThis can be expressed using the von Neumann entropy `S(A) = -trace(A*ln(A))`:\n`del_b = -S(rho) - (-S(tau)) = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\nThe state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. The density matrix for a pure state is `rho = |psi><psi|`. The von Neumann entropy of any pure state is always zero.\nTherefore, `S(rho) = 0`.\n\nThis significantly simplifies the calculation of non-Gaussianity to:\n`nG = del_b = S(tau)`\n\nSo, our task is to find the von Neumann entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`.\n\n**3. Define the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nThe reference Gaussian state `tau` is defined as the Gaussian state that has the same first and second statistical moments as the non-Gaussian state `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moments:** For the given state with `phi = -pi/4`, which is an odd cat state, the expectation values of the quadrature operators are zero. This means the state is centered at the origin of the phase space, and so is the reference Gaussian state `tau`.\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance Matrix):** The properties of the Gaussian state `tau` are captured by its covariance matrix `V`. The entropy of this state `tau` can be calculated from the determinant of its covariance matrix.\n\n**4. Calculate the Entropy of `tau`**\n\nThe von Neumann entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state `tau` is given by the formula:\n`S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\nwhere `nu` is the symplectic eigenvalue of the covariance matrix `V`. For a single mode, `nu` is simply the square root of the determinant of `V`, i.e., `nu = sqrt(det(V))`.\n\nFor an odd cat state (like the one with `phi = -pi/4`), the determinant of the covariance matrix is given by the formula:\n`det(V) = (<n> + 0.5)^2 - (alpha^2)^2`\nwhere `<n>` is the mean photon number of the cat state, and `alpha` is the amplitude. The mean photon number for an odd cat state is:\n`<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n\n**5. Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow we can substitute the given values (`alpha = 0.5`) into these formulas.\n\n*   `alpha = 0.5`\n*   `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n*   `alpha^4 = 0.0625`\n\nFirst, calculate the mean photon number `<n>`:\n`<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n\nNext, calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n`nu = sqrt( (<n> + 0.5)^2 - 0.0625 )`\n\nFinally, calculate the entropy `S(tau)`, which is our measure of non-Gaussianity:\n`nG = S(tau) = (nu + 0.5) * ln(nu + 0.5) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\n\nThese steps were implemented in the provided Python code, which gave the result: `1.3863...`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated value of non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.3863. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 0.25\nB) 1.38\nC) 0\nD) 2.48\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
