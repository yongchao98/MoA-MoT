    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0` (singlet state).\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State\nThe final state consists of the NN system and an emitted particle X.\n`NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum with respect to the NN system is `l_X`, denoted by the lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n    *   Unless specified otherwise, we can assume particle X is spinless (`s_X = 0`), so its total angular momentum is `j_X = l_X`.\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   Its quantum numbers are denoted `S_f`, `L_f`, and `J_f`.\n    *   We are given that its total isospin is `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Its parity is `P_f(NN) = (-1)^(L_f)`.\n\n### 3. Apply the Conservation Laws and Given Rules\n\nWe must check three conditions for each potential reaction:\n\n**Condition 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's angular momentum (`j_X`).\n*   `J_i = J_f + j_X` (vector sum).\n*   Since `J_i = 0`, `J_f` and `j_X` must be coupled to zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n*   Assuming `s_X = 0`, we have `j_X = l_X`. So, the condition simplifies to **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities and the orbital parity: `P_f(total) = P_f(NN) * P(X) * P(orbital)`.\n*   `P(orbital)` is the parity associated with the relative orbital motion of the final particles, which is `(-1)^(l_X)`.\n*   So, `P_f(total) = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   The conservation law is `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   This implies the exponent must be even: `L_f + l_X + 1 = 2n`.\n*   This simplifies to the condition that **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number**.\n\n**Condition 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states a specific requirement for the final NN state:\n*   `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   We are given `T_f = 0`.\n*   So, `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   For this equation to hold, `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n*   This means **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these three conditions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f = 3` (from `2S+1=7`), `L_f = 2` (D), `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. (✓)\n*   This reaction is permitted by all three given rules. (Note: A `7D1` state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system, but it passes the specific rules we were asked to check.)\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `3 = 3`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓)\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `0 = 0`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. **(✗ This is an even number, which violates the condition.)**\n*   This reaction is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics condition for the final state.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>"
