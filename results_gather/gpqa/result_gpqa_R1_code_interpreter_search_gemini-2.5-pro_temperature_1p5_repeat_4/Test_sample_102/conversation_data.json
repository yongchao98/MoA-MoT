    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   Let's assign the acetyl group (-COCH₃) to position 1.\n*   The bromo group (-Br) is at position 3.\n*   The nitro group (-NO₂) is at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nThe order in which these groups are added to the benzene ring is crucial, as each group directs the next incoming group to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director** due to its lone pairs participating in resonance.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nWe need to find a sequence that logically leads to the 1,3,5 substitution pattern in high yield.\n\n**A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene + Br₂/FeBr₃ → Bromobenzene. The bromo group is an ortho, para-director.\n*   **Step ii):** Bromobenzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → This will produce a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major). Neither of these has the required meta-relationship for building the final product. This pathway will not lead to a high yield of the target.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta-director.\n*   **Step ii):** Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline. This reduces the nitro group to an amino group (-NH₂), which is a strong activating group and an ortho, para-director.\n*   **Step iii):** Aniline + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts acylation) → This reaction does not work as intended. The amino group (-NH₂) is a strong Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex. This complex deactivates the ring so strongly that the Friedel-Crafts acylation of the ring fails.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect due to a fundamentally flawed step.\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii):** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   **Step iii):** Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride (diazotization).\n*   **Step iv):** Benzenediazonium chloride + H₃PO₂ → Benzene (deamination).\n*   This sequence of reactions converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. It is a pointless loop and does not lead to the desired product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone. This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a meta-director. This is a good first step.\n*   **Step ii):** Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone. Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, the incoming bromine will be directed to the meta position (C3). This step correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   **Step iii):** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitration. Now we must place the nitro group.\n    *   The ring has two substituents: -COCH₃ (at C1, meta-director) and -Br (at C3, ortho, para-director).\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The directing effects are in conflict. However, in such cases, we must also consider steric hindrance and the relative deactivating strengths. The positions ortho to the substituents (2 and ortho-part of 6) are sterically hindered. A detailed analysis shows that the least disfavored position is C5. Therefore, nitration occurs at position 5, yielding **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, the desired product. This pathway is known to produce the target compound as the major product.\n*   **Steps iv) to vii):** These subsequent steps (reduction, nitration, diazotization, deamination) would modify and ultimately destroy the target molecule that was already successfully synthesized in step iii. These steps appear to be extraneous and are likely an error in the question's formatting. However, the initial three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, only sequence D provides a viable synthetic route to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one in its initial steps. The other options fail due to incorrect directing effects or incompatible reactions. Despite the superfluous final steps listed in option D, it is the only choice that correctly describes how to build the molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>"
