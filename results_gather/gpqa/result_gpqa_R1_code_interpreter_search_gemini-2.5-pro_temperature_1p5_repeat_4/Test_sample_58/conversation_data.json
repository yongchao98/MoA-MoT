    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe problem asks for the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (acetic acid, CH₃COOH), a strong acid (hydrochloric acid, HCl), and a strong base (barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of acidic and basic species.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (Weak Acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol CH₃COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (Strong Acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol HCl\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = **0.080 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (Strong Base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)₂\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, it dissociates completely to yield two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol OH⁻**\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe reaction will proceed in order of strength. The strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react first with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid vs. Strong Base**\n    *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH⁻**\n\nNow, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base vs. Weak Acid**\n    *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH⁻**\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final composition and calculate the pH.**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains a significant amount of excess strong base (OH⁻). The presence of the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) is negligible in determining the pH compared to the strong base. The pH of the final solution is determined by the concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = (Moles of excess OH⁻) / (Total Volume)\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is: pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nTo verify the calculation, a Python script can be used.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate initial moles\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500\nmoles_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_baoh2 = 0.3 * 0.300\nmoles_oh = 2 * moles_baoh2 # Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- ions\n\n# Neutralization Step 1: Strong acid vs. Strong base\nremaining_oh_after_sa_sb = moles_oh - moles_hcl\n\n# Neutralization Step 2: Remaining strong base vs. Weak acid\nexcess_oh = remaining_oh_after_sa_sb - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Calculate final concentration and pH\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\nfinal_oh_concentration = excess_oh / total_volume\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npoh = -math.log10(final_oh_concentration)\nph = 14 - poh\n\nprint(f\"{ph:.2f}\")\n\n```\nThe calculation confirms that there is an excess of strong base, leading to a high pH. The final pH is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This confirms the calculation. The final pH of the solution is determined by the excess strong base (OH⁻) remaining after all neutralization reactions are complete. The calculated pH is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
