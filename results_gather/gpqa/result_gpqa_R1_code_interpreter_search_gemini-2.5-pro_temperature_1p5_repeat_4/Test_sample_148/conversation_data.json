    "*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The 1H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. The total integral is correct (1H), and the integrals of the two peaks are roughly equal. This indicates the presence of two different chemical species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the protons corresponding to these two peaks must be in slightly different chemical environments. This immediately rules out enantiomers (C), as enantiomers are indistinguishable in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment and would produce a single peak.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The Liquid Chromatography (LC) step separates the crude mixture into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different species in a 1:1 ratio that have different physical properties, allowing for their separation on a chromatography column. The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data shows that both separated peaks have the exact same mass, and this mass is consistent with the expected product.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass. However, they have different three-dimensional arrangements and therefore different physical properties. This means they can be separated by standard chromatography (like LC). Because they are structurally different, corresponding protons in each diastereomer are in different chemical environments and will have different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum. This option is perfectly consistent with all observations: two peaks in the LC, same mass for both peaks in the MS, and two distinct signals for the same proton in the NMR. This is a common outcome in peptide synthesis if one of the chiral amino acid building blocks undergoes epimerization (inversion of stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon) during a coupling reaction.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction forming a product with a different covalent structure (e.g., a dimer or a branched peptide). Such a product would almost certainly have a different mass from the expected molecule, which contradicts the MS data showing both peaks have the expected mass.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by standard LC and would appear as a single peak. They are also indistinguishable by standard NMR. This contradicts both the LC and NMR data.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (starting material) would have a different chemical formula and therefore a different mass than the final product. The MS data, which shows both LC peaks having the same, expected mass, rules out this possibility.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the data (two NMR peaks, two separable LC peaks, identical mass for both) is that the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. The observation that the LC peaks are still clearly defined at *elevated temperature* further strengthens this conclusion over other possibilities like slowly-interconverting conformers (rotamers), as heat would cause rotamer peaks to coalesce.\n\n<<<A>>>"
