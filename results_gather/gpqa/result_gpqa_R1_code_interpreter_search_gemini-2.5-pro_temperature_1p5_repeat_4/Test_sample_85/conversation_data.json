    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Products\n\nThe products of the two reactions are stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Reaction 1 Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2 Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLet's understand the structure of this product. It's a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   \"Pyran\" indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   \"Tetrahydro\" means the ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   \"2-one\" means there is a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position, which is adjacent to the ring oxygen (O1). This confirms it's a lactone.\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the C4 position.\n*   \"(R)\" or \"(S)\" indicates the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nThis lactone is a δ-lactone, which is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The open-chain precursor is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH\n\nThe chiral center in the acid is at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group), which becomes C4 in the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved during lactonization.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid cyclizes to form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid cyclizes to form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents\n\nThe options provided for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Although the name is a bit unconventional, it describes a molecule derived from 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other has formed an ester with isobutanol.\n\nThe structure is: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu (where iBu = isobutyl group, -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n1.  A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n2.  An ester (-COOiBu)\n\nThe chiral center is at the C3 position (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nNow, let's analyze the reagents and their selectivity. This is the crucial part of the problem.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 1: LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group remains mostly untouched under typical conditions.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 2: BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   BH₃ is also a selective reducing agent, but its selectivity is opposite to that of LiBH₄. It reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols very rapidly, while it reacts much more slowly with esters.\n\n### Step 3: Deduce Starting Material A for Reaction 1\n\n**Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group of the starting material.\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + LiBH₄  ⟶  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at the ester carbonyl carbon, which is not the chiral center. Therefore, the configuration of the chiral center (C3) is retained.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The resulting hydroxy-acid (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) cyclizes under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone.\n4.  **Connecting to the product:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-acid must be (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. This means the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\nTherefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Step 4: Deduce Starting Material B for Reaction 2\n\n**Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material.\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + BH₃  ⟶  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at the carboxylic acid carbon, which is not the chiral center. The configuration of the chiral center (C3) is retained.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The resulting hydroxy-ester (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate) undergoes intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone and isobutanol.\n4.  **Connecting to the product:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-ester must have the (S) configuration. This means the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nTherefore, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)-enantiomer**.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
