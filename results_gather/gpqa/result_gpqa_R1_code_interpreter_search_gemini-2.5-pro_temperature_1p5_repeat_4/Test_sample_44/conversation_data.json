    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the System Components**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Governing Principle:** Fermions obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in this well are quantized.\n*   **Quantum States:** For this system, a particle's quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (which can be 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for \"spin-up\" or -1/2 for \"spin-down\").\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in the well is given by `E_n = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2 / 2mL^2)`. The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = π^2 * ħ^2 / 2mL^2`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels are:\n    *   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n    *   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n    *   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n    *   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n    *   and so on...\n*   **State Capacity:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** fermions, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** We place the first two particles in the n=1 level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = `2 * E_1 = 2 * 1E = 2E`.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles in the next lowest level, n=2 (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = `2 * E_2 = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    *   `E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the lowest-energy configuration achievable by promoting one particle from the ground state to a higher, unoccupied level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Lowest Energy Excitation:** The smallest \"jump\" in energy is to move a particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **New Configuration:**\n    *   Two particles remain in n=1.\n    *   One particle remains in n=2.\n    *   One particle is promoted to n=3.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    *   `E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible simple excitations from the ground state and find the second lowest energy increase.\n\n*   **First Excited State (already found):** Total energy = `15E`. This resulted from moving a particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   **Let's find the next possible excitations:**\n    *   **Possibility A: Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n        *   Total Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility B: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n        *   Total Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   **Possibility C: Promote a particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n        *   Total Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (`15E`, `18E`, `20E`, `22E`, ...), the second lowest energy after the ground state is `18E`.\n\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):** `18E`.\n\n### **Summary**\n\n*   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n*   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n*   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
