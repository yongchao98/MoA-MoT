    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n    *   **FTIR:** The presence of an ester group is confirmed. An ester functional group contains the structure R-COO-R' and has two oxygen atoms. This means the molecular formula must end in O2. All four options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) satisfy this condition.\n\n    *   **Molecular Structure Core:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This implies a benzene ring with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core formula of this part of the molecule is C6H4.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means we can eliminate any proposed structure that contains a methylene (-CH2-) group. This rules out substituents like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), or allyl (-CH2CH=CH2).\n        *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** The compound has two distinct types of methyl groups.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically `–CH=CH–CH3`.\n            *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n            *   This group contributes `C3H5` to the formula and accounts for one of the two –CH3 signals.\n        *   **Putting it together:** Since one –CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group, the second –CH3 signal must belong to the ester. Given the \"no –CH2\" rule, the ester must be a methyl ester (`–COOCH3`), not an ethyl or larger ester. This group contributes `CO2CH3` to the formula.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) with two different substituents in a para (1,4) arrangement would give two signals (two doublets), consistent with this description.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Deduced Structure:**\n\n    We have the following components:\n    *   A benzene ring core: `C6H4`\n    *   A propenyl group substituent: `–C3H5`\n    *   A methyl ester substituent: `–COOCH3`\n\n    Combining these parts gives the molecule methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n\n    Let's sum the atoms from the assembled structure:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 1 (from –CO–) + 1 (from –OCH3) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from –OCH3) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\n    The DBE (or index of hydrogen deficiency) can be used as a check.\n    *   **From spectral data:** Aromatic ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds) = 4 DBE. Ester C=O group = 1 DBE. Vinyl C=C group = 1 DBE. Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   **From the derived formula (C11H12O2):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    The DBE calculation is consistent.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n\n    *   A) C12H14O2 (DBE = 12 + 1 - 14/2 = 6)\n    *   B) C11H12O2 (DBE = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6)\n    *   C) C12H12O2 (DBE = 12 + 1 - 12/2 = 7)\n    *   D) C11H14O2 (DBE = 11 + 1 - 14/2 = 5)\n\n    *   Option D is incorrect because its DBE of 5 is too low to accommodate an aromatic ring, an ester, and a vinyl group.\n    *   Option C is incorrect because its DBE of 7 implies an extra ring or double bond for which there is no evidence in the NMR data.\n    *   This leaves options A and B. To get from B (C11H12O2) to A (C12H14O2), one must add a `CH2` unit. As established from the NMR data, the molecule contains no `–CH2–` groups. Therefore, option A is impossible.\n\n    The only formula that perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence is **C11H12O2**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
