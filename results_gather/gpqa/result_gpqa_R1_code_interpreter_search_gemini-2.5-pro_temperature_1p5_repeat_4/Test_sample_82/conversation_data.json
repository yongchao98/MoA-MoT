    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of pH at two different points in a titration process: at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n**Part 1: Initial Dilution and Stoichiometry**\n\n1.  **Calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n    *   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n    *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final volume of the acid solution (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2:\n        M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n    *   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of acetic acid to be titrated.**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (in L)\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of acid = moles of base.\n    *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n**Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Determine the state of the solution.**\n    *   25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added = 25% of 10.00 cm³ = 0.25 × 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³\n    *   At this point, the solution contains unreacted acetic acid (a weak acid) and its conjugate base, sodium acetate (formed from the reaction). This is a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of acid and conjugate base.**\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol\n    *   Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol\n    *   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n    *   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (acetate) formed = 0.00025 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.**\n    *   pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n    *   First, calculate pKa: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   The ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles since they are in the same volume.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075) = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log(3) ≈ 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25\n\n**Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Determine the state of the solution.**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (0.001 mol).\n    *   The solution now contains only sodium acetate in water. The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze.\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion.**\n    *   Total volume = Initial volume of acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   Concentration of CH₃COO⁻ = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH of the weak base solution.**\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis:\n        *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**1. Understand the initial conditions and the dilution step.**\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The new volume of the acetic acid solution is V₂ = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂) of acetic acid.\n    *   M₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 mol/L * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n*   So, the titration begins with 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid.**\n*   Moles = Molarity × Volume (in Liters)\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L * (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol.\n\n**3. Analyze the titration reaction and the equivalence point.**\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O.\n*   The stoichiometry is 1:1. At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will equal the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n*   Moles of NaOH at equivalence = 0.001 mol.\n*   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach equivalence = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n**4. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH has been added, or equivalently, 25% of the initial acid has been neutralized.\n*   Moles of NaOH added = 25% of 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.\n*   This creates a buffer solution containing the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = 0.001 mol (initial) - 0.00025 mol (reacted) = 0.00075 mol.\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 0.00025 mol.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid]).\n*   First, find pKa: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵).\n*   The ratio of concentrations [conjugate base]/[acid] is the same as the ratio of moles since they are in the same volume: 0.00025 mol / 0.00075 mol = 1/3.\n*   pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)\n*   pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 ≈ 4.26.\n\n**5. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of CH₃COOH has been converted to 0.001 mol of its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   The total volume of the solution is the initial acid volume plus the volume of NaOH added: 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   The concentration of acetate is [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   Acetate is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n*   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n*   Let x = [OH⁻] at equilibrium. Then [CH₃COOH] = x and [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ 0.02 M (since x will be small).\n*   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n*   x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n*   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n*   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517 ≈ 8.52.\n\n**6. Consolidate Results and Select the Answer.**\n*   The calculated pH at 25% titration is ~4.26.\n*   The calculated pH at the equivalence point is ~8.52.\n*   These values match option C.\n\nThe python code below will execute these calculations precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: Initial State & Dilution ---\n# Initial concentration and volume of acetic acid\nM_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nV_acid_initial = 20.00 # cm3\n\n# Dilution\nV_water = 20.00 # cm3\nV_acid_final = V_acid_initial + V_water\nM_acid_final = (M_acid_initial * V_acid_initial) / V_acid_final\n\n# Moles of acid to be titrated\nmoles_acid = M_acid_final * (V_acid_final / 1000)\n\n# NaOH titrant\nM_base = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# This is a buffer region.

    "Based on the detailed reasoning and the output from the executed code:\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation:** The initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a new concentration of 0.025 M in a total volume of 40.00 cm³.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:** At this point, a buffer solution exists. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])) is used. The pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73. At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base (acetate) to remaining acid is 25%/75% = 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25. The code calculated a more precise value of **4.26**.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:** All the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming its conjugate base, acetate. The solution consists of acetate ions, which hydrolyze water to produce hydroxide (OH⁻), making the solution basic. The calculation involves finding the concentration of acetate, calculating Kb from Ka, and then determining the [OH⁻] to find the pOH and subsequently the pH.\n    *   The calculations, as performed by the code, yield a pH of **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.
