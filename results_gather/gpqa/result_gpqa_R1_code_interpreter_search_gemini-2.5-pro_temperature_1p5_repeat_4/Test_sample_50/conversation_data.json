    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    *   We have a conducting sphere of radius R.\n    *   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is maintained at zero (V = 0).\n    *   A point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`.\n    *   We need to find the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    *   This problem is a classic application of the method of images. To find the electric field and potential outside the sphere, we can replace the grounded sphere with a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere.\n    *   The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the original sphere (at a distance R from the center) is zero.\n    *   The standard derivation for a grounded sphere gives the following for the image charge and its position:\n        *   **Position of image charge (b):** The image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n        *   **Magnitude of image charge (q'):** The image charge has a magnitude and sign given by `q' = -q * (R / d)`.\n\n3.  **Model the System for Energy Calculation:**\n    *   The potential energy of the original system (charge `q` and the grounded sphere) is equivalent to the interaction energy of the charge `q` with the field created by the sphere.\n    *   Using the method of images, the field created by the sphere is identical to the field created by the image charge `q'`.\n    *   So, we need to calculate the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    *   A crucial point in calculating the energy of a system involving dielectrics or conductors is the formula `U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n    *   In our system, the total energy is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position `d`. The energy stored in the field is:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_sphere`\n        where `V_sphere` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the sphere's induced charges.\n    *   Since the sphere is grounded, any charges that flow to it from the ground to become the \"induced charge\" do not have work done on them by the field of `q` (as they are brought along a V=0 path). The work is done on `q` by the field of the induced charges.\n    *   Using our image model, `V_sphere` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n    *   Let's calculate this potential:\n        *   The real charge `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n        *   The image charge `q'` is at distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center.\n        *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `Δx = d - b = d - R^2 / d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n        *   The potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is `V_at_q = k * q' / Δx`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `Δx`:\n        `V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n        `V_at_q = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Now, we use the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`. The factor of 1/2 is essential and arises because we are calculating the energy stored in the field, which is generated by the interaction. If we just calculated the interaction energy of two point charges (`k*q*q'/Δx`), we would be double-counting the energy. A more rigorous approach is to integrate the force `F` from infinity to `d`, `U = ∫_∞^d F⋅dl`, which yields the same result with the 1/2 factor.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated expression is `U = - (1/2) * k*q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        *   A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n        *   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n        *   C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n        *   D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   Our result perfectly matches option C. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, and the system has lower potential energy than when the charge is at infinity (where U=0).\n\n<<<C>>>"
