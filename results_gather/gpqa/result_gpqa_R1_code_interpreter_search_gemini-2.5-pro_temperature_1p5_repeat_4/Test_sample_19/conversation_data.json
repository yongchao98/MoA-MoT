    "An analysis of the assumptions is performed below.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\nThe user is asking about the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics, specifically in the context of an interaction where the target nucleons are treated as if they were free particles.\n\nLet's break down the impulse approximation and what it entails. The impulse approximation simplifies the complex problem of a projectile interacting with a many-body system (a nucleus) by treating the interaction as a sum of incoherent interactions with the individual constituents (nucleons). The name \"impulse\" comes from the idea that the interaction delivers a sudden, sharp \"kick\" or impulse to one of the constituents.\n\nFor the process to be modeled as an interaction with a single *free* nucleon, several conditions must be met:\n\n1.  **The interaction must be with a single nucleon.** The projectile (e.g., an electron, neutrino) shouldn't interact with multiple nucleons at once or with the virtual particles (mesons) exchanged between them. This is the essence of **Statement 1: \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This assumption isolates a single nucleon as the target, which is the first step in treating it like a free particle. This statement is a core part of the approximation.\n\n2.  **The interaction must be \"sudden.\"** The time scale of the projectile-nucleon interaction (τ_int) must be much shorter than the characteristic time scale of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus (τ_nuc). The nuclear time scale is related to the energy spacing of nuclear levels or the time it takes for a nucleon to travel across the nucleus. If τ_int << τ_nuc, the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors or feel the effects of the nuclear binding potential *during* the brief moment of the collision. It essentially behaves as a free, stationary particle at the moment of impact. This is precisely what **Statement 4: \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces\"** describes. This is the \"impulse\" part of the name and is fundamental.\n\n3.  **The journey of the projectile and the ejected particle must be simple.** For the overall observed process to mimic a free-nucleon collision, the projectile must arrive at the target nucleon, and the struck nucleon must exit the nucleus, without significant further interactions. If the incoming projectile scatters from other nucleons before the main interaction, or if the outgoing particles re-scatter on their way out (a phenomenon known as Final-State Interactions or FSI), then the measured outcome will be distorted and will not look like a clean collision with a free particle. The assumption that these additional interactions do not happen is captured by **Statement 2: \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This is a key component of the simplest and most common form of the impulse approximation, known as the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA).\n\n4.  **The internal structure of the nucleon.** **Statement 3: \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This statement deals with the sub-structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, at the level of nuclear physics, treats nucleons as the fundamental degrees of freedom. It does not make assumptions about the dynamics of the quarks and gluons inside the nucleon. The internal structure of the nucleon is typically encapsulated in functions called \"form factors,\" which are determined from experiments on free nucleons (e.g., electron-proton scattering). Whether the quarks inside are relativistic or not is a question for the theory of strong interactions (QCD) and specific models of the nucleon (like the constituent quark model). It is not a prerequisite for the impulse approximation itself, which works at the nucleon-in-nucleus level. Therefore, this assumption is not required.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTo approximate a nuclear interaction as one occurring with a free nucleon, we need to assume:\n*   The interaction happens with only one nucleon (Statement 1).\n*   The interaction is so fast that binding forces are negligible during the collision (Statement 4).\n*   The rest of the nucleus does not interfere with the projectile or the ejected particle (Statement 2).\n\nTherefore, the set of assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
