    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on a described experiment.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This targets the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n    *   **Observation Site:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine, a key site for initiating immune responses to gut antigens.\n    *   **Cell Population:** Proliferating cells isolated from the Peyer's patches. Proliferation (clonal expansion) is a sign of an active adaptive immune response following antigen presentation.\n    *   **Key Finding:** Sequencing reveals \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Options in the Context of the Key Finding:**\n\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process changes the *constant* region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (e.g., switching from producing IgM to IgG or IgA). It does *not* alter the *variable* region, which is responsible for antigen binding. The observation is about variability in the *variable* region, so this is not the primary process described.\n\n    *   **B) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system, involving a cascade of serum proteins. It does not involve genetic changes in B cells. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). It deliberately introduces a high rate of point mutations into the genes encoding the *variable* regions of the antibody heavy and light chains. This process creates the \"high variability\" observed and is the basis for affinity maturation, where B cells that bind the antigen more strongly are selected to proliferate. This perfectly matches the experimental observations: proliferating cells in a secondary lymphoid organ showing high variability in their variable heavy chain gene after antigen exposure.\n\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that initially creates the diversity of B cell receptors by randomly combining Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) gene segments. However, this occurs in the bone marrow during the initial development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The process described in the question is happening *after* antigen exposure in a secondary lymphoid organ, leading to further diversification of an already-existing receptor on a proliferating clone.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability specifically in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in a Peyer's patch after antigen challenge is the classic definition of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
