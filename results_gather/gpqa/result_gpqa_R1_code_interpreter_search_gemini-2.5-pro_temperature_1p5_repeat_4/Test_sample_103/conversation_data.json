    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The star wobbles as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away. The magnitude of this shift is proportional to the star's radial velocity along our line of sight.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is related to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) by the Doppler formula: $\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_r / c$. The question gives the *amplitude* of the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$), which corresponds to the *amplitude* of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K_{star}$.\n    Therefore, $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n3.  **Establish the Ratio of Velocity Amplitudes:**\n    *   For planet #1, $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom.\n    *   The ratio of the stellar velocity amplitudes is:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n4.  **Derive the Relationship between Velocity Amplitude (K) and Orbital Period (T):**\n    The amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K_{star}$) for a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K_{star} = v_{star} \\sin(i) = \\frac{2\\pi a_{star}}{T} \\sin(i)$\n    where $v_{star}$ is the star's orbital speed, $a_{star}$ is the radius of the star's orbit around the common center of mass, $T$ is the orbital period, and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n    The star's orbital radius ($a_{star}$) is related to the planet's semi-major axis ($a$) by the center of mass equation: $M_{star} a_{star} = M_{planet} a_{planet}$. Since $a = a_{star} + a_{planet}$, we can write $a_{star} = a \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star} + M_{planet}}$.\n\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the period and semi-major axis:\n    $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_{star} + M_{planet})} a^3 \\implies a = \\left( \\frac{G(M_{star} + M_{planet})T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Substituting the expressions for $a_{star}$ and $a$ into the equation for $K_{star}$ and simplifying, we get:\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + M_{planet})^{2/3}} T^{-1/3}$\n\n    Since the problem states that the planets are much less massive than the stars ($M_{planet} \\ll M_{star}$), we can approximate $M_{star} + M_{planet} \\approx M_{star}$. The relation becomes:\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} T^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Apply the Relationship to the Two Systems:**\n    We can write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{ (M_{p2} \\sin i_2) / (M_{s2}^{2/3} T_2^{1/3}) }{ (M_{p1} \\sin i_1) / (M_{s1}^{2/3} T_1^{1/3}) }$\n\n    The problem provides the following information:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $M_{p1} = M_{p2}$.\n    *   The problem is symmetric, so it is reasonable to assume the unstated orbital inclinations are the same: $i_1 = i_2$.\n\n    With these conditions, the terms for mass and inclination cancel out:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{ T_2^{-1/3} }{ T_1^{-1/3} } = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods ($T_2/T_1$):**\n    We have two expressions for the ratio $K_2/K_1$:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Therefore:\n    $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Cube both sides to solve for $T_1/T_2$:\n    $1.4^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    $2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n\n    Finally, invert the ratio to find the answer to the question, \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\":\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744}$\n\n    Let's perform the final calculation.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes K2/K1 is 7/5.\nK_ratio = 7/5\n\n# The relationship is K proportional to T^(-1/3), so K2/K1 = (T2/T1)^(-1/3).\n# This means (T2/T1) = (K2/K1)^(-3) = (K1/K2)^3.\nT_ratio = (1/K_ratio)**3\n\nprint(T_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the ratio $T_2/T_1$ is approximately 0.3644.

    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning used to arrive at the solution:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Physics**\n\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method to compare two exoplanetary systems. This method relies on the Doppler effect. As a planet orbits a star, it gravitationally tugs on the star, causing the star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble results in a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines as it moves towards (blueshift) and away from (redshift) us.\n\n*   **Key Concept 1: Doppler Shift and Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight. The maximum shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    *   Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n*   **Key Concept 2: Stellar Velocity, Mass, and Period:** The amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) is related to the properties of the system (masses of the star and planet, orbital period, and orbital inclination). For a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + M_{planet})^{2/3}} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    where:\n    *   $M_{planet}$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n### **2. Applying the Concepts to the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the periods, $T_2/T_1$. Let's set up a ratio of the velocity amplitudes, $K_2/K_1$.\n\n**Step 2a: Relate Wavelength Shifts to Velocity Amplitudes**\n\nFrom Key Concept 1, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n**Step 2b: Simplify the Velocity Amplitude Formula**\n\nWe are given the following simplifying conditions:\n*   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses: $M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$.\n*   Since the inclination ($i$) is not mentioned, we can assume it's the same for both systems, which is a standard assumption in such comparison problems.\n\nGiven these conditions, most of the terms in the formula for $K$ will cancel out when we take a ratio. Let's see what the proportionality looks like:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + M_{planet})^{2/3}} T^{-1/3}$\n\nSince the mass and inclination terms are the same for both systems, they cancel out, leaving a simple relationship between $K$ and $T$:\n$K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n**Step 2c: Form the Ratio and Solve**\n\nNow we can write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes in terms of the periods:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nWe have two expressions for the ratio $K_2/K_1$:\n1.  From the wavelength shifts: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$\n2.  From the physics formula: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nEquating them gives:\n$1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nWe need to solve for $T_2/T_1$. First, let's solve for $T_1/T_2$ by cubing both sides:\n$(1.4)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n$2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n\nFinally, invert the fraction to get the desired ratio:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis result means that the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. A larger radial velocity wobble for the star implies a shorter orbital period for the planet, all else being equal.\n\n### **3. Final Calculation and Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated ratio is ~0.3644. This matches option A.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes, K2/K1, is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\nK_ratio = 7 / 5\n\n# The relationship between the velocity amplitude (K) and the period (T) is K ∝ T^(-1/3).\n# Therefore, K2/K1 = (T2/T1)^(-1/3).\n# To solve for the period ratio T2/T1, we rearrange the equation:\n# T2/T1 = (K2/K1)^(-3) or T2/T1 = (K1/K2)^3\nperiod_ratio_T2_over_T1 = (1 / K_ratio)**3\n\nprint(period_ratio_T2_over_T1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation confirms that the ratio is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Based on the reasoning and the code execution result, the logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Ratio of Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K):** The amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$).\n    *   $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$.\n\n2.  **Relationship between Velocity (K) and Period (T):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude $K$ is related to the system's properties. Given that the star masses are identical, the planet masses are similar, and we assume the orbital inclinations are the same, the relationship simplifies to:\n    *   $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$ (where T is the orbital period).\n\n3.  **Solving for the Period Ratio:** We can now write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes in terms of the orbital periods:\n    *   $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Calculation:** We combine the two expressions for the ratio $\\frac{K_2}{K_1}$:\n    *   $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   To find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, we first solve for $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$ by cubing both sides:\n        *   $(1.4)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\implies 2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    *   Finally, we invert the result to get the desired ratio:\n        *   $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThe result ~0.3644 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
