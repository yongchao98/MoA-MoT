    "This problem requires a comparison between two different types of mean free paths within the same environment (a vacuum chamber).\n\n1.  **Identify the two mean free paths:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding *with each other*. This is the standard definition from the kinetic theory of gases.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam as they travel through the residual gas, i.e., the average distance an electron travels before it scatters off a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is determined by the formula:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the residual gas molecules).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that one particle presents to another for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Analyze the parameters for λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   For both scenarios, the gas conditions (pressure, temperature, volume) are the same. Therefore, the number density `n` of the gas molecules is the same for the calculation of both λ1 and λ2.\n    *   The difference between λ1 and λ2 must then arise from the difference in their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections:**\n    *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collision):** The collision is between two gas molecules. The collision cross-section (σ1 = σ_gas-gas) is related to the physical size of the molecules. These are relatively large particles moving at thermal velocities. For example, the kinetic diameter of a nitrogen molecule is about 3.7 angstroms.\n    *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collision):** The collision is between a very high-energy (1000 kV) electron and a gas molecule. An electron is a point-like particle. The interaction is governed by the electromagnetic force between the electron and the atom's nucleus and electron cloud. Because the electron is extremely energetic and has a tiny effective size, its probability of being significantly scattered by a gas molecule is much lower than the probability of two bulky gas molecules colliding.\n    *   In physics, the scattering cross-section for high-energy particles is known to be very small. A fast, tiny projectile is much more likely to pass through a sparse field of targets than another target-sized projectile is.\n    *   Therefore, the collision cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule (σ2 = σ_electron-gas) is *much smaller* than the kinetic cross-section for two gas molecules (σ1 = σ_gas-gas).\n    *   So, we have **σ2 << σ1**.\n\n5.  **Conclude the relationship between λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   Since λ = 1 / (n * σ) and `n` is constant, the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ).\n    *   Because σ2 is much smaller than σ1, it follows that λ2 must be *much larger* than λ1.\n    *   **λ2 >> λ1**\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This contradicts our finding.\n    *   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This statement is consistent with λ2 being much larger than λ1. If λ2 is, for instance, 1000 times larger than λ1, it is certainly \"greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ1\". This is a weak, but correct, inequality.\n    *   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This option claims that λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1 (less than 22% larger). This is physically wrong, as the difference is expected to be orders of magnitude.\n    *   D) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. This would imply the cross-sections are equal, which they are not.\n\nBased on the physical principles, λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Option B is the only one that correctly reflects this relationship.\n\nTo provide a quantitative illustration, we can use a Python script with plausible physical values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script demonstrates the relationship between the two mean free paths\n# based on their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n# Let's analyze the ratio of the mean free paths, which is what matters.\n# lambda1 is the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other.\n# The formula includes a sqrt(2) factor to account for the relative motion of molecules in a gas.\n# lambda1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * sigma1) where sigma1 is the gas-gas cross-section.\n\n# lambda2 is the mean free path of a high-velocity electron beam in a (relatively) stationary gas.\n# The formula does not have the sqrt(2) factor.\n# lambda2 = 1 / (n * sigma2) where sigma2 is the electron-gas cross-section.\n\n# The number density 'n' is the same in both cases.\n# The ratio is:\n# lambda2 / lambda1 = [1 / (n * sigma2)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * sigma1)]\n# lambda2 / lambda1 = (sqrt(2) * n * sigma1) / (n * sigma2)\n# lambda2 / lambda1 = sqrt(2) * (sigma1 / sigma2)\n\n# sigma1: Gas-gas kinetic cross-section (e.g., N2 molecule). Literature values are around 4e-19 m^2.\nsigma1_gas_gas = 4.3e-19  # m^2\n\n# sigma2: Electron-gas scattering cross-section. For high-energy electrons (like 1000kV),\n# this is much smaller. Values are typically orders of magnitude less than gas-kinetic cross-sections.\n# Let's use an illustrative value of 1e-22 m^2.\nsigma2_electron_gas = 1e-22 # m^2\n\n# Calculate the ratio lambda2 / lambda1\nratio = math.sqrt(2) * (sigma1_gas_gas / sigma2_electron_gas)\n\nprint(f\"Illustrative Gas-Gas Cross-Section (sigma1): {sigma1_gas_gas:.2e} m^2\")\nprint(f\"Illustrative Electron-Gas Cross-Section (sigma2): {sigma2_electron_gas:.2e} m^2\")\nprint(f\"Ratio of cross-sections (sigma1/sigma2) is approximately: {sigma1_gas_gas/sigma2_electron_gas:.0f}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of mean free paths (lambda2/lambda1) is approximately: {ratio:.0f}\")\n\n# Check which option this result supports.\nprint(\"\\n--- Evaluating Options ---\")\nprint(f\"Option A (lambda2 < lambda1): {ratio < 1}\")\nprint(f\"Option B (lambda2 >= 1.22 * lambda1): {ratio >= 1.22}\")\nprint(f\"Option C (lambda1 < lambda2 < 1.22 * lambda1): {1 < ratio < 1.22}\")\nprint(f\"Option D (lambda2 = lambda1): {ratio == 1}\")\n\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nIllustrative Gas-Gas Cross-Section (sigma1): 4.30e-19 m^2\nIllustrative Electron-Gas Cross-Section (sigma2): 1.00e-22 m^2\nRatio of cross-sections (sigma1/sigma2) is approximately: 4300\nThe calculated ratio of mean free paths (lambda2/lambda1) is approximately: 6081\n\n--- Evaluating Options ---\nOption A (lambda2 < lambda1): False\nOption B (lambda2 >= 1.22 * lambda1): True\nOption C (lambda1 < lambda2 < 1.22 * lambda1): False\nOption D (lambda2 = lambda1): False\n```\nThe calculation confirms that λ2 is thousands of times larger than λ1. Therefore, the only correct statement among the choices is that λ2 is greater than 1.22*λ1.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `n` is the number density of target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with **other gas molecules**. Here, the moving particle is a gas molecule, and the target is also a gas molecule.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of high-energy electrons colliding with **gas molecules**. Here, the moving particle is an electron, and the target is a gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Components of the MFP Formula:**\n    *   **Number Density (n):** The conditions inside the sample compartment (pressure, temperature, volume) are the same for both calculations. Therefore, the number density `n` of the residual gas molecules is constant in both scenarios.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (σ):** This is the key difference.\n        *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collision):** The collision cross-section, σ₁, is the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecules. This represents the effective area for two relatively large, slow-moving molecules to collide. A more precise formula for MFP of a gas molecule in a gas of identical molecules is λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁), where the √2 accounts for the relative motion of the molecules.\n        *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collision):** The collision cross-section, σ₂, describes the scattering of a high-energy electron by a gas molecule. An electron is a point-like particle, and it is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (accelerated by 1000 kV). It interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom. The probability of such a high-energy, small projectile being significantly scattered by the sparse electric field of a single atom is much lower than the probability of two bulky gas molecules physically colliding. Therefore, the electron-gas collision cross-section (σ₂) is **much smaller** than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ₁).\n        *   So, we have **σ₂ << σ₁**.\n\n4.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), and σ₂ is much smaller than σ₁, it follows that λ₂ must be **much larger** than λ₁.\n    *   λ₂ >> λ₁\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect. This contradicts our conclusion.\n    *   B) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: This statement asserts that λ₂ is at least 22% larger than λ₁. Since our physical reasoning concludes that λ₂ is *much* larger than λ₁, this inequality is definitely true.\n    *   C) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. This suggests that λ₂ is only slightly larger than λ₁. Our analysis shows the difference should be orders of magnitude, not a mere 22%.\n    *   D) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. There is a fundamental physical difference between the two types of collisions, so the mean free paths are expected to be different.\n\n**Conclusion:** The mean free path for a high-energy electron traveling through a gas (λ₂) is significantly greater than the mean free path for the gas molecules colliding with each other (λ₁). Option B is the only one that correctly captures this relationship.\n\n<<<B>>>"
