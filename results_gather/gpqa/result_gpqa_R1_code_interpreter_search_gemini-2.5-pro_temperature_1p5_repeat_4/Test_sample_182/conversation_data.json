    "**1. Determine the Structure and Molecular Formula of the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon-3 and carbon-4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is the principal functional group (-COOH), so it is located at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is at position C5.\n\nLet's determine the number of atoms to find the molecular formula.\n*   **Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n    *   Total Carbons (C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n\n*   **Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    We start with a cyclohexane ring (C6H12) and make modifications.\n    1.  Create a double bond between C3 and C4 (cyclohex-3-ene): C6H10. The H count on each carbon is: C1(2H), C2(2H), C3(1H), C4(1H), C5(2H), C6(2H).\n    2.  Add substituents by replacing H atoms on the ring:\n        *   At C1, add -COOH: Replace one H. C1 now has 1H left.\n        *   At C2, add -CHO: Replace one H. C2 now has 1H left.\n        *   At C5, add -CH=CH2: Replace one H. C5 now has 1H left.\n    3.  Count the hydrogens on the ring carbons: 1(on C1) + 1(on C2) + 1(on C3) + 1(on C4) + 1(on C5) + 2(on C6) = 7 H.\n    4.  Count the hydrogens on the substituent groups: 1(in -COOH) + 1(in -CHO) + 3(in -CH=CH2) = 5 H.\n    5.  Total Hydrogens (H) = 7 (ring) + 5 (substituents) = 12.\n\n*   **Oxygen atoms (O):**\n    *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the formyl group.\n    *   Total Oxygens (O) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P/HI).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This is a very strong reduction reaction. It reduces virtually all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts.\n    *   Alkene (C=C) → Alkane (C-C)\n    *   Aldehyde (-CHO) → Methyl group (-CH3)\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) → Methyl group (-CH3)\n*   The reaction will preserve the carbon skeleton. The six-membered ring will not be opened under typical conditions.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction reduces all points of unsaturation and functional groups in the starting material:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product has 10 carbon atoms. The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, for a molecule can be calculated using the formula:\nIHD = (2C + 2 - H - X + N) / 2\nwhere C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n\nFor the product with the formula **C10H20**:\nIHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = 2 / 2\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be determined from the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains:\n*   One ring (contributes 1 to IHD).\n*   Zero double or triple bonds (contributes 0 to IHD).\nSo, the total IHD of the product is 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
