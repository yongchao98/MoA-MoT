    "This is a common colloquialism in a chemistry lab, particularly in organic chemistry where purification is a constant and often challenging task. Let's break down the meaning.\n\n1.  **The Context**: The chemist's experiment went \"not well.\" This implies a problem with the outcome, which in synthesis is often a failure to isolate the desired product in a pure form. The final step after running a reaction is almost always purification.\n2.  **Purification Techniques**: Chemists use several methods to separate compounds from a mixture. The most common in a synthetic organic chemistry lab is **chromatography** (like Thin-Layer Chromatography or Column Chromatography). In these techniques, a mixture is applied to a stationary phase (like silica gel), and a solvent (the mobile phase) is used to move the compounds along.\n3.  **\"On Top of Each Other\"**: This phrase is a visual description.\n    *   In **Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC)**, different compounds in a mixture separate into distinct \"spots\" at different heights. If two compounds have very similar properties, their spots will not separate and will appear at the same heightâ€”literally \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   In **Column Chromatography**, which is used for large-scale purification, the compounds separate into bands that travel down the column. If the bands don't separate, the compounds will elute from the column at the same time, and they will be mixed together in the collected fractions. The chemist would know this because the TLC analysis of the fractions would show the spots \"on top of each other.\"\n4.  **The Underlying Property**: The primary property that governs separation in the most common forms of chromatography (normal-phase chromatography on silica gel) is **polarity**. Molecules with different polarities interact differently with the polar silica gel and the less polar solvent, causing them to travel at different rates. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at nearly the same rate, making them very difficult or impossible to separate. They will appear \"on top of each other\" on a TLC plate.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this reasoning:\n\n*   **A) Similar optical rotations**: Optical rotation is a physical property used for characterization, not separation. It has no bearing on whether compounds can be separated by common techniques like chromatography.\n*   **B) Similar boiling points**: This would make separation by distillation difficult. While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of chromatography spots than distillation. Chromatography is the workhorse of purification in a synthetic lab.\n*   **C) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities**: This is the most direct cause for a failed separation by column or thin-layer chromatography. It perfectly explains why the compounds would be \"on top of each other\" on a TLC plate and why the chemist would be frustrated.\n*   **D) The compounds are bonding to each other**: While molecules interact, this isn't the reason for a failed separation. A failed separation is due to the compounds interacting with the separation medium (like silica gel) in a *similar* way, not because they are stuck to each other.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is most likely complaining that the compounds in their mixture have nearly identical polarities, making them inseparable by standard chromatographic methods.\n\n<<<C>>>"
