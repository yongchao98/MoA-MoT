    "This problem requires us to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets. Let's break down the physics and the calculations step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be expressed as $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from the star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Let's write out the expressions for both planets:\n    $T_{eq1} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}$\n    $T_{eq2} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}$\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms will cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} (R_{star}/(2a_1))^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} (R_{star}/(2a_2))^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\n    So, the problem is reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n4.  **Using Radial Velocity Data:** The radial velocity (RV) method provides the information needed to determine the semi-major axes. The maximum RV of the star induced by a planet (the RV semi-amplitude, $K$) is given by the formula (for a circular orbit where planet mass $M_p <<$ star mass $M_{star}$):\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}} \\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n    where $i$ is the orbital inclination and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n5.  **Solving for the Semi-Major Axis ($a$):** Let's rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2 i}{M_{star}^2} \\frac{G M_{star}}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2 i}{M_{star} a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2 i}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n6.  **Finding the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2 / a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2 i_2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2 i_1 / (M_{star} K_1^2)}$\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, $M_{star}$ is constant. The gravitational constant $G$ is also a constant. The problem states that both planets were detected by the transit method, which implies their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on. This allows us to assume the inclinations are the same and close to 90°, so $\\sin i_1 \\approx \\sin i_2 \\approx 1$. Thus, the $\\sin i$ terms cancel out.\n    The ratio simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n7.  **Relating Doppler Shift to RV Semi-Amplitude ($K$):** The Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) to the radial velocity ($v_r$):\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    The maximum periodic shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$).\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n8.  **Substituting into the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n9.  **Final Calculation for Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left[ \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2 \\right]^{1/2}$\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left| \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} \\right|$\n    Since mass and wavelength shifts are positive magnitudes, the absolute value is unnecessary.\n\n10. **Plugging in the Values:**\n    *   Mass of Planet1, $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n    *   Mass of Planet2, $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet1, $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet2, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    Now, let's compute the final numerical value.\n\n```python\n# Given values\n# Masses are in Earth mass units, which will cancel out in the ratio.\nM_p1 = 7.0\nM_p2 = 5.0\n\n# Doppler shifts are in Angstroms, which will also cancel out.\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# Calculate the ratio of RV semi-amplitudes (K1 / K2), which is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts.\nrv_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is given by:\n# (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * rv_ratio\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 0.5357, which rounds to 0.53. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe result matches option D. Note that the information about the star's properties (mass, radius, temperature) and the planets' radii were not needed to solve for the ratio, as these terms canceled out.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:** We need to find the ratio for the two planets, $T_{eq1}$ and $T_{eq2}$.\n    $T_{eq1} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}$\n    $T_{eq2} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}$\n\n    The problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). When we take the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$, these terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\n    This simplifies the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n4.  **Finding the Semi-Major Axis ($a$):** The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) of the star is given by:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{G}{a} \\right)^{1/2} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}}$\n    (assuming the planet's mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$). Here, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n5.  **Solving for $a$ and finding the ratio $a_2/a_1$:**\n    Squaring the equation:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{G}{a} \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2 i}{M_{star}}$\n    Solving for $a$:\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2 i}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n    Now we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2 i_2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2 i_1 / (M_{star} K_1^2)}$\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out. The problem states that both planets were detected by the transit method, which implies their orbital planes are aligned with our line of sight. Therefore, we can assume the inclinations are nearly identical and close to 90 degrees, so $\\sin i_1 \\approx \\sin i_2 \\approx 1$. These terms also cancel. The ratio simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n6.  **Relating $K$ to Doppler Shift:** The Doppler shift formula is $\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_r / c$, where $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the change in wavelength, $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength, $v_r$ is the radial velocity, and $c$ is the speed of light. The maximum periodic Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the ratio of K's back into the ratio of a's:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Now, substitute this into our temperature ratio formula from step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left[ \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2 \\right]^{1/2}$\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n8.  **Plug in the given values:**\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7 \\, M_{Earth}$\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5 \\, M_{Earth}$\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5 \\, M_{Earth}}{7 \\, M_{Earth}} \\times \\frac{0.03 \\, \\text{Å}}{0.04 \\, \\text{Å}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.53, which matches option D. The extra information about the star's and planets' radii and the star's temperature was not needed for this specific question.\n\n```python\n# Final calculation to confirm the result\nratio = (5/7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<<<D>>>",
