    "*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound based on its most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of about one-third (32%) of the molecular ion peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options, using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl):\n        *   All four options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n        *   The M+2 peak would be from the ³⁷Cl isotope: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 158 g/mol.\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂. This eliminates none of the options, but confirms the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimerized through hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This value is typical for an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This strongly supports options A and D, and rules out options B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride/ester which lacks the O-H group) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde/phenol, which would have a different C=O stretch and a phenolic O-H stretch, not the very broad carboxylic acid O-H).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The singlet multiplicity is also expected. This further supports options A and D.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region is crucial. Having only two signals, both of which are doublets and integrate to 2 protons each, indicates a highly symmetric, para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring's axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two on the other side.\n        *   **Structure A (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It would produce exactly this pattern: two doublets, each representing 2 protons.\n        *   **Structure D (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. All four aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments relative to the two different substituents. This would result in a more complex pattern, likely with four separate signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H. It would not produce two doublets of 2H each.\n\n*   **Final Synthesis:**\n    *   The MS confirms the molecular formula and the presence of chlorine.\n    *   The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The aromatic region of the NMR (two doublets of 2H each) confirms a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid (A) fits all of these spectral data points.\n\n<<<A>>>"
