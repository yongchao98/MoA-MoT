    "**1. Mass Dimension Analysis**\n\nIn quantum field theory, we use natural units where $\\hbar = c = 1$. In this system, mass, momentum, and energy have a mass dimension of $+1$, while length and time have a mass dimension of $-1$.\n\nThe action, $S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$, must be a dimensionless quantity.\nThe mass dimension of the spacetime volume element $d^4x$ is $[d^4x]_M = [L^4]_M = (M^{-1})^4 = M^{-4}$.\nFor the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $+4$.\n$[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$.\n\nEvery term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4. This allows us to determine the mass dimension of the fields and coupling constants.\n\n*   **Fermion field ($\\psi$):** The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{fermion} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$.\n    *   The dimension of this term must be 4: $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M + [\\psi]_M = 4$.\n    *   The derivative $\\partial_\\mu$ has a mass dimension of $+1$, so $[\\partial_\\mu]_M = 1$.\n    *   The dimensions of $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$ are the same: $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M$.\n    *   Therefore, $2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4$, which gives $[\\psi]_M = 3/2$.\n\n*   **Gauge field strength tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$):** The kinetic term for a gauge field is $\\mathcal{L}_{gauge} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   The dimension of this term must be 4: $[F_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n    *   This implies $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$, so $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n\n*   **Sigma matrix ($\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$):** $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$. The Dirac gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless constant matrices. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless, i.e., $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given interaction term:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nThe mass dimension of this term must also be 4:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa]_M + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M = -1$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**2. Renormalizability**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory is determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ has $[\\text{g}]_M > 0$, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ has $[\\text{g}]_M = 0$, the theory is renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ has $[\\text{g}]_M < 0$, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nIn this case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$. A negative mass dimension means that at high energies (in the ultraviolet regime), this interaction becomes increasingly strong. In perturbation theory, this leads to infinities that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counter-terms. An infinite number of counter-terms would be required, rendering the theory non-renormalizable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n*   Since the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
