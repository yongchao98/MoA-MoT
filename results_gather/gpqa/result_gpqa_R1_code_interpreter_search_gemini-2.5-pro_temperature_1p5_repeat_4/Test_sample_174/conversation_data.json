    "*   **1. Identify the Physical Model:**\n    The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroid shape, with the axis of symmetry along the z-axis. An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. Since the oscillation has a defined axis (the z-axis), the simplest and most dominant form of radiation will be that of an oscillating electric dipole. We can model this system as an electric dipole `p` oscillating along the z-axis, i.e., `p(t) = p₀ cos(ωt) ẑ`.\n\n*   **2. Recall the Formula for Electric Dipole Radiation:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` from an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n    `dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π²ε₀c³) * sin²(θ)`\n    where:\n    *   `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n    *   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `θ` is the polar angle between the direction of observation and the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\n*   **3. Analyze the Angular Dependence to Find the Fraction:**\n    The function `f` mentioned in the problem is the power per unit solid angle, so `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`.\n    From the formula, we see that the angular dependence is given by `sin²(θ)`.\n    `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\n    The maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (or `π/2` radians).\n    So, `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\n    We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n    At `θ = 30°`, the power is `f(λ, 30°) ∝ sin²(30°)`.\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the maximum power:\n    `Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n*   **4. Analyze the Wavelength Dependence to Find the Form of f:**\n    The question also asks for a possible form of the function `f`. We need to determine its dependence on the wavelength `λ`.\n    From the radiation formula, the power is proportional to `ω⁴`:\n    `f(λ, θ) ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the expression `ω = 2π/T = 2πf_freq = 2πc/λ`.\n    Substituting this into the proportionality, we get:\n    `f(λ, θ) ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n    This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is famously known from Rayleigh scattering (which is why the sky appears blue).\n\n*   **5. Combine the Results and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    We have found:\n    1.  The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n    2.  A possible form of the function `f` involves a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\n    Comparing these results with the given options:\n    A) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n    B) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n    C) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n    D) 1/4, λ⁻³\n\n    Option A perfectly matches our findings.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the angle in degrees\ntheta_degrees = 30\n\n# Convert the angle to radians for the sin function\ntheta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n\n# The angular dependence of the radiated power for an electric dipole is sin^2(theta).\n# The power at the given angle is proportional to this value.\npower_at_30_deg = math.sin(theta_radians)**2\n\n# The maximum power occurs at theta = 90 degrees, where sin^2(90) = 1.\n# This serves as our reference for the maximum power, A.\nmax_power = math.sin(math.radians(90))**2\n\n# The fraction of the maximum power is the ratio of the power at 30 degrees to the maximum power.\nfraction = power_at_30_deg / max_power\n\n# The output should be 1/4 or 0.25\nprint(f\"The fraction of maximum power radiated at {theta_degrees} degrees is: {fraction}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An oscillating charge distribution, especially one with a defined symmetry axis like a spheroid oscillating along that axis, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` from an oscillating electric dipole is given by the Larmor formula, which has an angular dependence of `sin²(θ)`, where `θ` is the angle between the oscillation axis (z-axis) and the direction of observation.\n    \n    `dP/dΩ = f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\n2.  **Maximum Power (A):**\n    The power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    \n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`\n\n3.  **Power at θ = 30°:**\n    We need to find the fraction of the maximum power that is radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`. At this angle, the power is:\n    \n    `(dP/dΩ) at 30° ∝ sin²(30°)`\n    \n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n4.  **Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the maximum power:\n    \n    `Fraction = [(dP/dΩ) at 30°] / [(dP/dΩ)_max] = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`\n\n5.  **Wavelength Dependence of f(λ, θ):**\n    The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is also proportional to the fourth power of the oscillation frequency `ω` (`P ∝ ω⁴`). The frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    \n    Substituting this relationship, we find the dependence on wavelength:\n    \n    `P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    \n    This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is also the reason for Rayleigh scattering (which explains why the sky is blue). So, a possible form for the function `f` includes a `λ⁻⁴` term.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**, and a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
