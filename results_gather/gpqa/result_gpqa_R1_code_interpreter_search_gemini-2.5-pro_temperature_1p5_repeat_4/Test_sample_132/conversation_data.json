    "This problem requires a multi-step approach to determine the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-).\n\n1.  **Calculate the molar concentrations of the initial species.**\n    The solution is prepared by dissolving KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O in water.\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and water.\n\n    We first need to calculate the moles of each salt and then their concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.20000 L) solution.\n\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4- = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Concentration of HPO4^2- = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n2.  **Determine the pH of the buffer solution.**\n    The solution contains a weak acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), which forms a buffer. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻ (Ka2 = 6.2x10⁻⁸)\n\n    We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    pH = pKa2 + log ([conjugate base] / [acid])\n    pH = pKa2 + log ([HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻])\n\n    *   pKa2 = -log(Ka2) = -log(6.2x10⁻⁸) = 7.21\n    *   pH = 7.21 + log(0.02809 / 0.03674) = 7.21 + log(0.7646) = 7.21 - 0.117 = 7.093\n    *   From the pH, we can calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = 10⁻pH = 10⁻⁷.⁰⁹³ = 8.07 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻).**\n    The orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion, which is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka3:\n    HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻ (Ka3 = 1.8x10⁻¹²)\n\n    The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka3 = ([H⁺][PO4³⁻]) / [HPO4²⁻]\n\n    We can rearrange this equation to solve for [PO4³⁻]:\n    [PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺]\n\n    Since Ka3 is very small, we can assume the equilibrium concentration of HPO4²⁻ is approximately equal to its initial concentration (0.02809 M). We use the [H⁺] calculated from the buffer pH.\n\n    *   [PO4³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.07 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO4³⁻] = 6.26 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is closest to option B. To confirm with a more precise calculation, we can use a computational approach.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.20000  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_h2po4 = (mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4) / volume_L\nconc_hpo4 = (mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o) / volume_L\n\n# Calculate pH and [H+] from the buffer system\npKa2 = -math.log10(Ka2)\npH = pKa2 + math.log10(conc_hpo4 / conc_h2po4)\nH_conc = 10**(-pH)\n\n# Calculate [PO4^3-] concentration from the third equilibrium\n# Ka3 = ([H+][PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-]\n# We assume [HPO4^2-] at equilibrium is the same as the initial concentration due to the very small Ka3 value.\nconc_po4 = Ka3 * conc_hpo4 / H_conc\n\nprint(f\"{conc_po4:.3e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.236e-07\n\nThe calculation yields a concentration of 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M for the orthophosphate ion.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires calculating the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) in a buffer solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n\nThe solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O). These salts dissociate in water to produce the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻) and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), respectively.\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    *   Volume = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n    *   Concentration = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    *   Concentration = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 2: Determine the pH and [H⁺] of the buffer solution.**\n\nThe solution contains a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This pair forms a buffer. The equilibrium that governs this buffer system is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻, with Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n*   pKa₂ = -log(Ka₂) = -log(6.2 x 10⁻⁸) = 7.21\n*   pH = pKa₂ + log ([Base] / [Acid])\n*   pH = 7.21 + log ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻])\n*   pH = 7.21 + log (0.02809 M / 0.03674 M) = 7.21 + log(0.7646) = 7.21 - 0.117 = 7.093\n\nNow, calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:\n*   [H⁺] = 10⁻pH = 10⁻⁷.⁰⁹³ ≈ 8.07 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻).**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed by the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This is the third dissociation step for phosphoric acid:\n\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻, with Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n\nThe equilibrium expression for this reaction is:\nKa₃ = ([H⁺][PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n\nWe can now plug in the values we have calculated. We assume the equilibrium concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] is equal to its initial concentration (0.02809 M) because the value of Ka₃ is extremely small, meaning very little of it will dissociate.\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.07 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n*   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.26 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value of 6.26 x 10⁻⁷ M is closest to option B. The small difference is due to rounding during the intermediate steps. The code execution, which used higher precision, gave a result of 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M, which rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<B>>>"
