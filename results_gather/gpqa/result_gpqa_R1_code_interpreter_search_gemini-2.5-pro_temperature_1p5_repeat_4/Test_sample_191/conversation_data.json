    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. A charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity. We need to find the electric field `E` at a point `P` located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Charge Induction:**\n    *   The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges in the conductor. A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if you draw a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material enclosing the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero (as it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the field to be zero, the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the induced charge on the inner wall must be `-q` to cancel the `+q` inside.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, to maintain overall charge neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key concept here is electrostatic shielding. A conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges placed inside it. The details of the charge configuration inside the cavity (the exact position of `+q`, the shape and position of the cavity) do not affect the electric field *outside* the conductor.\n    *   The total electric field at any point is the superposition of the fields from all charges: the original charge `+q`, the induced inner surface charge `-q`, and the induced outer surface charge `+q`.\n    *   Let's consider the combined effect of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface. This pair of charges creates an electric field that is non-zero inside the cavity, but is *exactly zero* everywhere outside the cavity (i.e., within the conductor material and outside the conductor).\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is determined *solely* by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   We've established that a total charge of `+q` resides on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface. The internal asymmetric configuration is completely shielded from the outer surface by the conducting material. The charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves to make the potential constant, which for an isolated sphere results in a uniform distribution.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The problem now simplifies to finding the electric field at point P due to a uniformly charged spherical shell of radius `R` with a total charge `+q`.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (or Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case:\n        *   The total charge on the outer shell is `+q`.\n        *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n        *   The distance of the point P from the center O is `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge `+q` at O:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Given Information:**\n    *   The problem provides several other parameters: the radius of the cavity `r`, the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center `s`, the distance of P from the cavity's center `l`, and an angle `\\theta`.\n    *   Based on the principle of electrostatic shielding, all of this information (`r`, `s`, `l`, `\\theta`) is irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. It serves as a distractor. This information would be necessary only if we were asked to calculate the field *inside* the cavity.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The correct expression for the electric field at point P is the one that depends only on the total charge `q` and the distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, uses distance from cavity center)\n    B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct, uses distance from conductor center)\n    C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, uses irrelevant parameters)\n    D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, uses irrelevant parameters)\n\nThe final answer is determined by the fundamental properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n<<<B>>>"
