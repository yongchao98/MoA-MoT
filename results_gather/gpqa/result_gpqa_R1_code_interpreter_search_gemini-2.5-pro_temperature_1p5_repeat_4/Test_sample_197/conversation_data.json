    "The reasoning and calculation performed in the previous step are correct. Let's break it down again to confirm.\n\n**1. Objective:**\nCalculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, out of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**2. Formula:**\nThe mole fraction (α) of a specific complex `[MLn]` in a solution is given by:\nα_n = `[MLn] / C_M_total`\n\nThis can be expressed using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`:\nα_n = `(β_n * [L]^n) / (1 + Σ(β_i * [L]^i))` for i = 1 to N\n\nFor our case, we want the percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]`, which is `α_2 * 100`.\n*   n = 2\n*   L = SCN⁻\n*   [L] = `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   β values are given: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n\nThe formula is:\nPercentage = `(β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) * 100`\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nThe Python code executed this exact calculation:\n\n*   **Numerator:** `β₂ * [SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   **Denominator:**\n    *   1\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻]` = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   **Sum of Denominator:** 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n*   **Fraction:** `Numerator / Denominator` = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   **Percentage:** 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%. This matches option A. The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not required for this calculation, as it cancels out when determining the relative percentage of a species. The assumption that `[SCN⁻]` is constant at 0.1 M is valid because it is in ten-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration.\n\nThe code output `16.916180326482287` confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
