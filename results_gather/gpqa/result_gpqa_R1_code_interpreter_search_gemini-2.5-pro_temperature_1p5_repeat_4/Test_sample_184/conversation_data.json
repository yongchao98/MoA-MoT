    "An elegant way to solve this problem is to compute the square of the Hamiltonian operator, $H^2$.\n\n1.  **The Hamiltonian Operator:**\n    The Hamiltonian is given by $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$, where $\\varepsilon$ is a constant with units of energy, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, and $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n2.  **Squaring the Hamiltonian:**\n    Let's calculate $H^2$:\n    $H^2 = ( \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n} )^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$\n\n3.  **Using the Pauli Matrix Identity:**\n    A key property of the Pauli matrices is given by the identity:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{a})(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{b}) = (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b})I + i\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b})$\n    where $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are any two vectors and $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n    To find $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$, we can set $\\vec{a} = \\vec{b} = \\vec{n}$ in this identity:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = (\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n})I + i\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n})$\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Identity:**\n    *   Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, its dot product with itself is $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$. So, $\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n} = 1$.\n    *   The cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector. So, $\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n} = \\vec{0}$.\n\n    Substituting these back into the equation:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (1)I + i\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{0} = I$\n\n5.  **Finding the Relation for Eigenvalues:**\n    Now we can substitute this result back into the expression for $H^2$:\n    $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n\n    Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian $H$, with a corresponding non-zero eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $H|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda|\\psi\\rangle$\n\n    Applying the operator $H$ one more time to both sides:\n    $H(H|\\psi\\rangle) = H(\\lambda|\\psi\\rangle)$\n    $H^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda(H|\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda(\\lambda|\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda^2|\\psi\\rangle$\n\n    We have two expressions for $H^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    (i) $H^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda^2|\\psi\\rangle$\n    (ii) $H^2|\\psi\\rangle = (\\varepsilon^2 I)|\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2|\\psi\\rangle$\n\n    Equating the two expressions gives:\n    $\\lambda^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2|\\psi\\rangle$\n\n6.  **Solving for the Eigenvalues:**\n    Since $|\\psi\\rangle$ is a non-zero eigenvector, we can conclude:\n    $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$\n\n    Solving for $\\lambda$, we find the eigenvalues:\n    $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
