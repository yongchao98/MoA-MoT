    "This problem requires us to calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment using both relativistic and classical physics, and then find the difference between these two values.\n\n### 1. Define Variables and Initial Conditions\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `E_M` = 300 GeV.\n*   Rest mass of the initial nucleus, `M`. `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is 0.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Let `m1` be the more massive fragment. We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations to find the rest-mass energies (`m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`):\n1.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n2.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find `m1*c^2`:\n`m1*c^2 = 2 * (99 GeV) = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`) is 198 GeV, and the less massive fragment (`m2`) is 99 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (`Q`) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This is due to the conservation of total energy.\n`Q = E_M - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\n`Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, where `T1` and `T2` are the kinetic energies of `m1` and `m2` respectively.\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Momentum\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after the fission must also be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n`|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is related to momentum `p` and mass `m` by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSince the momenta are equal:\n`p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical`\n`p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n\nTherefore:\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n\nWe can express this in terms of rest-mass energies:\n`m1*c^2 * T1_classical = m2*c^2 * T2_classical`\n`198 * T1_classical = 99 * T2_classical`\n`T2_classical = (198 / 99) * T1_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 6. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy, `E = T + mc^2`.\n\nSubstituting `E`:\n`(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*mc^2 + (mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\n`(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*mc^2`\n\nSince the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments, `(pc)^2` is also the same:\n`(pc)^2 = T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2)`\n`(pc)^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nTherefore:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nSubstitute the known values (`m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`) and the relation `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nThis is the correct, relativistic kinetic energy for the more massive fragment.\n\n### 7. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for `T1`.\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nConvert the result to MeV:\n`0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`\n\n```python\n# Define initial parameters\nE_M = 300  # Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments\n# m1_c2 + m2_c2 = 0.99 * E_M\n# m1_c2 = 2 * m2_c2\n# 3 * m2_c2 = 0.99 * E_M\nm2_c2 = 0.99 * E_M / 3\nm1_c2 = 2 * m2_c2\n\n# Calculate total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nQ = E_M - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation for T1 ---\n# T1_c + T2_c = Q\n# m1 * T1_c = m2 * T2_c  => T2_c = (m1/m2) * T1_c = 2 * T1_c\n# T1_c + 2 * T1_c = Q\n# 3 * T1_c = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation for T1 ---\n# (pc)^2 = T1^2 + 2*T1*m1_c2\n# (pc)^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2_c2\n# T2 = Q - T1\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1_c2 = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*m2_c2\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1_c2 = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*m2_c2 - 2*T1*m2_c2\n# 2*T1*m1_c2 = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + 2*Q*m2_c2 - 2*T1*m2_c2\n# T1 * (2*m1_c2 + 2*Q + 2*m2_c2) = Q^2 + 2*Q*m2_c2\n# T1 * (2 * (m1_c2 + m2_c2) + 2*Q) = Q * (Q + 2*m2_c2)\n# The previous algebraic expansion was correct and simpler: 600 * T1 = 603\n# Let's re-verify it.\n# Eq: T1^2 + 2*T1*m1_c2 = (Q-T1)^2 + 2*(Q-T1)*m2_c2\n# Let's solve for T1 numerically using a solver or by rearranging.\n# From derivation: 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 => 600*T1 = 603\nT1_relativistic = (Q**2 + 2*Q*m2_c2) / (2*m1_c2 + 2*m2_c2 + 2*Q)\nT1_relativistic_simple = (Q*Q + 6*m2_c2) / (6*m2_c2 + 6*m1_c2 - 6*m2_c2) = (9 + 594)/(600) # This isn't right\n# Let's stick to the clear derivation: 600 * T1 = 603\nT1_relativistic = 603 / 600 # This comes from T1*(2*m1_c2 + 2*m2_c2 + 2*(m2_c2 - m1_c2)/ (T1/T2)) which is too complex\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3-T1)^2 + 2*(3-T1)*99 -> T1^2 + 396*T1 = 9-6T1+T1^2 + 594-198T1 -> 396T1=603-204T1 -> 600T1 = 603\nT1_relativistic_val = 603.0 / 600.0\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_gev = T1_relativistic_val - T1_classical\ndifference_mev = difference_gev * 1000\n\nprint(f\"{difference_mev:.0f}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",

Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy `E_M = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Total rest-mass energy of fragments: `E_fragments = 0.99 * E_M = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Let the fragments have rest-mass energies `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`. We are given `m1 = 2*m2`.\n*   So, `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` and `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   Solving this system: `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` -> `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` -> `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, the more massive fragment has a rest-mass energy of `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n*   The Q-value is the energy released as kinetic energy, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = E_M - E_fragments = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation):**\n*   By conservation of momentum (the initial nucleus is at rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since the momentum `p` is the same for both, `T` is inversely proportional to `m`.\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Substituting into the Q-value equation: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3*T1_classical = 3 GeV` -> `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 (Relativistic - Correct Value):**\n*   The relativistic momentum is given by `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`, where `E = T + mc^2` is the total energy.\n*   ` (pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   Substitute `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 + 603 - 204T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204T1`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference:**\n*   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Convert to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
