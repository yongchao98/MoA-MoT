    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms over various energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The problem states that the stellar photospheres can be assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which justifies the use of this equation.\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy levels, say a higher energy state 'j' and a lower energy state 'i':\n\n`N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]`\n\nwhere:\n*   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in energy states j and i.\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of those energy levels.\n*   `E_j` and `E_i` are the energies of the states. The difference `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels, denoted as `ΔE`.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Applying the Equation to the Two Stars\n\nWe are given two stars, star_1 and star_2, with effective temperatures T_1 and T_2, respectively. We are considering the same transition of iron atoms in both stars, so the terms `g_j`, `g_i`, and `ΔE` are the same for both.\n\nFor star_1 (temperature T_1):\n`(N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n\nFor star_2 (temperature T_2):\n`(N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n### 3. Using the Given Information\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the ground state is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n\n`(N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2`\n\nNow we can substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relationship:\n\n`(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]]`\n\nThe term `(g_j / g_i)` cancels out from both sides:\n\n`exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n### 4. Solving for the Relationship between T_1 and T_2\n\nTo solve this equation, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n`ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x):\n\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + [-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\n`ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\nCombine the fractions inside the parentheses by finding a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n### 5. Substituting the Numerical Values\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference `ΔE = 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Let's compute the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n\n`ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n\nThe problem is designed such that this ratio simplifies to 1. Substituting this value back into our derived equation:\n\n`ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n`ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nComparing this final result with the given options:\nA) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] - Incorrect\nB) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] - **Correct**\nC) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Incorrect\nD) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] - Incorrect\n\nThe derived equation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
