    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial and final states and the process:**\n    *   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This corresponds to the 3s orbital of the hydrogen atom.\n    *   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the ground state, the 1s orbital.\n    *   Process: The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|int\\rangle$. The path is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |int\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:**\n    The selection rules for quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$ in an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer change (for decay, $\\Delta n < 0$).\n\n3.  **Determine the possible intermediate state(s):**\n    *   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |int\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state has $l=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n        *   Since it is a decay, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n        *   For a valid hydrogen atom state, we must have $l' < n'$. Since $l'=1$, the smallest possible value for $n'$ is 2. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n        *   A transition to $n'=1$ is not possible for the first step, because if $n'=1$, then $l'$ must be 0. This would violate the $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   For the magnetic quantum number, the initial state has $m=0$. The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ means that $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, so $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   Combining these findings, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. These correspond to the 2p subshell.\n\n    *   **Second transition: $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state for this step has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n        *   The final state has $m_f=0$. Let's check the $\\Delta m$ rule for each possible intermediate state:\n            *   From $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$. Allowed.\n            *   From $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$. Allowed.\n            *   From $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$. Allowed.\n        *   Therefore, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. In fact, the 2p state's only allowed dipole decay channel is to the 1s state.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. Since the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ must proceed through one of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability of populating a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\n    The transition rate from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment: $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    We need to compare the rates of transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay process cannot have a preferred orientation for the resulting angular momentum of the atom. This physical intuition implies that the three final states $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, which are distinguished only by their orientation in space (the value of $m'$), must be populated with equal probability.\n\n    A more formal argument using the Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that the transition probability from an unpolarized $l=0$ state to an $l'=1$ state is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m'$. The matrix elements for these transitions are proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$, which are all equal to 1. Thus, the transition rates are equal:\n    $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle)$.\n\n    Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the intermediate state, the probability for any single one is $1/3$.\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state with probability 1 (since this is the only available dipole decay channel).\n    Therefore, the probability of the entire cascade following a specific route is simply the probability of the first step. For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability is $1/3$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (**Correct route and probability**)\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
