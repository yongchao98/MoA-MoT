    "An optically active compound is a chiral compound. A compound is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often due to the presence of one or more chiral centers, but can also arise from other elements of chirality like axial or planar chirality. A compound is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups) in this molecule.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the `C=C` double bond and all the atoms directly attached to it. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:**\n    *   The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   The presence of `R` and `S` descriptors signifies the absolute configuration at chiral centers. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the compound must be chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   However, the molecule is symmetric, meaning the groups on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   In such cases, the diastereomer with opposite configurations at the two identical chiral centers (one R, one S) is called a *meso* compound.\n    *   A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal element of symmetry (in this case, a center of inversion when drawn appropriately) and is superimposable on its mirror image. Achiral compounds are not optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The `(2R,3R)` configuration is diastereomeric to the meso `(2R,3S)` form.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` isomer and its mirror image, the `(2S,3S)` isomer, are not superimposable on each other. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:**\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer, the `(R)` isomer.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the alkene part of the ring (`-CH=CH-`), and the alkane part of the ring (`-CH2-CH2-`).\n    *   Since a single enantiomer is specified, it is a chiral compound and will be optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:**\n    *   This nomenclature typically refers to the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (the *cis* isomer).\n    *   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a C3 axis of rotation perpendicular to the ring. More importantly, it has three vertical planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:**\n    *   Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, which is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. A cyclopentyl group is attached to C1, and a methyl group is attached to C3.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. This can also be seen as a ketone formed from a cyclopentyl group and an isobutyl group `((CH3)2CH-CH2-)`.\n    *   We need to check for chiral centers. The only candidate is C3 of the butane chain. Let's analyze the groups attached to it by tracing the chain from that carbon:\n        *   The structure can be written as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n        *   The carbon in question is the `CH` of the isobutyl group. It is bonded to one H atom, two methyl (-CH3) groups, and one `-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` group.\n    *   Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
