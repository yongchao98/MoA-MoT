    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   `butan-2-one`: A ketone. Its structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n        *   `NaCN`: Sodium cyanide, a source of the cyanide nucleophile (CN⁻).\n        *   `A`: An unknown reagent.\n    *   **Product:** `2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`: An α-hydroxy nitrile, also known as a cyanohydrin. Its structure has a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the same carbon (C2), which was the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  The C=O double bond breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate.\n        3.  This alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent 'A' must be the proton source (H⁺) needed for the final protonation step.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for A:**\n        *   `NaHSO₃`: Sodium bisulfite is used for forming crystalline addition products with aldehydes, not for cyanohydrin formation. So, options A and B are incorrect.\n        *   `H₃O⁺`: Hydronium ion, which represents a strong acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄). This is an excellent source of protons.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be H₃O⁺. This narrows the choices down to options C and D.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   **Reactant:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile`: This is an α-hydroxy nitrile (a cyanohydrin).\n    *   **Product:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`: This is an α-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Transformation:** The nitrile group (-C≡N) is converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    *   **Conditions:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires harsh conditions, typically heating in the presence of a strong acid or a strong base. The reaction involves the addition of two water molecules across the C≡N triple bond.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** The reaction is shown with `B (H₂O)`, indicating that B is a catalyst used with water for the hydrolysis.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for B (from remaining choices C and D):**\n        *   `HCl` (from option C): Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. It is a standard and effective catalyst for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles. It protonates the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water, driving the reaction towards the carboxylic acid.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (from option D): Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it can provide protons, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical laboratory conditions. Stronger acids are required.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** HCl is the more suitable and conventional reagent for this transformation.\n\n3.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis of the first reaction, reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Based on the analysis of the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.\n    *   Combining these two findings, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
