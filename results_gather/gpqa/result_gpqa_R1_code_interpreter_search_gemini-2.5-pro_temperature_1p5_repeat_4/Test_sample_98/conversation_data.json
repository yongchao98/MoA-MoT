    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Conclusion: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   \"No vinyl-hydrogens\": This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   The most crucial information comes from the splitting patterns (multiplicities) of the signals:\n        *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This means the proton(s) giving this signal are coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n            *   One adjacent proton (causes the **doublet**, n+1=1+1=2).\n            *   Two adjacent protons (causes the **triplet**, n+1=2+1=3).\n            *   Three adjacent protons (causes the **quartet**, n+1=3+1=4).\n        *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This means the proton(s) giving this signal are coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n            *   One adjacent proton (causes the **doublet**, n+1=1+1=2).\n            *   Two adjacent protons (causes one **triplet**, n+1=2+1=3).\n            *   Another, different group of two adjacent protons (causes the second **triplet**, n+1=2+1=3).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n\n    Let's analyze the structure of each option to see if it would produce these specific splitting patterns. We'll use the \"n+1 rule\" and look for protons with the required number of neighbors.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n        Let's draw out the structure and label the key protons. The formula represents 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\n        `           Et (group Y)`\n        `            |`\n        `CH₃(a) - CH(b) - CH(c) -- CH₂(d) -- COOH`\n        `        |`\n        `        Et (group X)`\n\n        *   **Analyze proton H(c):**\n            *   It is adjacent to one proton, H(b) -> gives a **doublet**.\n            *   It is adjacent to the two protons of the CH₂(d) group -> gives a **triplet**.\n            *   It is adjacent to the two protons of the CH₂ within its own ethyl group (group Y) -> gives a **triplet**.\n            *   Therefore, the signal for H(c) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n        *   **Analyze proton H(b):**\n            *   It is adjacent to one proton, H(c) -> gives a **doublet**.\n            *   It is adjacent to the two protons of the CH₂ within its own ethyl group (group X) -> gives a **triplet**.\n            *   It is adjacent to the three protons of the CH₃(a) group -> gives a **quartet**.\n            *   Therefore, the signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other observed signal.\n\n        *   Conclusion for A: This structure perfectly explains both of the complex splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n        This structure is 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid. Let's analyze the alpha-proton (the one on the carbon next to COOH). It is coupled to one adjacent methine (CH) proton and the two protons of the CH₂ in its ethyl group. This would result in a doublet of triplets (dt), not a `dtt` or `dtq`. While another proton in the chain might be a `dtt`, the structure lacks a proton that could be a `dtq` because there's no proton adjacent to a methyl (CH₃), a methine (CH), and a methylene (CH₂) group simultaneously.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n        This structure is 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid.\n        `            CH₃`\n        `             |`\n        `CH₃(a) - CH(b) - CH(c) -- CH₂(d) -- COOH`\n        `         |`\n        `         CH₃`\n        The proton H(c) is coupled to H(b) (1H, doublet), CH₂(d) (2H, triplet), and its own methyl group (3H, quartet). This would give a **dtq**. However, there is no proton that would give a **dtt** signal. For example, proton H(b) is coupled to two different methyl groups and H(c), which would give a doublet of quartets of quartets.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n        This structure is 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid. Let's analyze the alpha-proton (on the carbon next to COOH). It's coupled to an adjacent methine (CH) proton and a methyl (CH₃) group. This would result in a doublet of quartets (dq), not a `dtt` or `dtq`. While another proton (the other CH) could be a `dtq`, there is no proton in the molecule that could give a `dtt` signal.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Only structure A, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has two different protons whose neighboring environments precisely match the required conditions to produce a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
