    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's analyze the structure to count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **(CH3)2C=**: A carbon atom is double-bonded to the next carbon in the chain. This carbon is also single-bonded to two methyl (CH3) groups.\n    *   Carbons: 1 (in chain) + 2 (in methyls) = 3 C\n    *   Hydrogens: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n*   **=CH-**: A carbon atom with one hydrogen, forming a double bond with the previous carbon and a single bond with the next.\n    *   Carbons: 1 C\n    *   Hydrogens: 1 H\n*   **-CH2-**: A carbon atom with two hydrogens, single-bonded to adjacent carbons.\n    *   Carbons: 1 C\n    *   Hydrogens: 2 H\n*   **-CH(CH3)-**: A carbon atom with one hydrogen and a methyl group, single-bonded to adjacent carbons.\n    *   Carbons: 1 (in chain) + 1 (in methyl) = 2 C\n    *   Hydrogens: 1 (on chain) + 3 (in methyl) = 4 H\n*   **-CH2-**: Another CH2 group.\n    *   Carbons: 1 C\n    *   Hydrogens: 2 H\n*   **-CH=**: A carbon atom with one hydrogen, single-bonded to the previous carbon and double-bonded to the next.\n    *   Carbons: 1 C\n    *   Hydrogens: 1 H\n*   **=C(CH3)2**: A carbon atom that is double-bonded to the previous carbon and single-bonded to two methyl groups.\n    *   Carbons: 1 (in chain) + 2 (in methyls) = 3 C\n    *   Hydrogens: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n\nNow, let's sum them up:\n*   **Total Carbons (C)** = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H)** = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### **2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nBased on the structure, we can count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: There are two double bonds in the structure: (CH3)2**C=CH**- and -**CH=C**(CH3)2. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: For an acyclic (non-cyclic) molecule, the total number of carbon-carbon links (single, double, triple) is equal to the number of carbon atoms minus one.\n    *   Total C-C links = 12 - 1 = 11.\n    *   Since we have 2 C=C bonds, the number of C-C single bonds is:\n        Number of C-C bonds = Total links - Number of C=C bonds = 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   9 C-C bonds\n*   2 C=C bonds\n*   22 C-H bonds\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound (ΔH_atom_compound) is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form gaseous atoms.\nΔH_atom_compound = (No. of C-C × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H × BE(C-H))\nGiven bond energies:\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom_compound = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atom_compound = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Constituent Elements**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is the enthalpy change for the reaction where the compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The formation reaction for C12H22 is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to convert these reactants into gaseous atoms (ΔH_atom_elements).\n*   12 C(s) → 12 C(g): This requires the enthalpy of atomization of carbon.\n*   11 H2(g) → 22 H(g): This requires breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n\nGiven data:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol (for C(s) → C(g))\n*   Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol (for H2(g) → 2H(g))\n\nΔH_atom_elements = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\nΔH_atom_elements = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΔH_atom_elements = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation can be found using Hess's Law:\nΔH_f = ΔH_atom_elements - ΔH_atom_compound\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n### **6. Convert the Answer to the Required Units**\n\nThe options provided are in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 1900 kJ/g (The value matches, but the unit is likely a typo)\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its formation)\n\nSince option B has the wrong unit, let's convert our answer to kJ/g and see if it matches option C.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22**:\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (which is appropriate for the approximate nature of the energy values given):\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Enthalpy of Formation in kJ/g**:\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166\n\nLet's perform the calculation.\n```python\n# Number of bonds\nnum_C_C = 9\nnum_C_eq_C = 2\nnum_C_H = 22\n\n# Bond energies and atomization energies (kJ/mol)\nBE_C_C = 200\nBE_C_eq_C = 300\nBE_C_H = 400\nH_atom_C = 1000\nBE_H_H = 100\n\n# Number of atoms\nnum_C_atoms = 12\nnum_H2_mols = 11\n\n# 1. Enthalpy of atomization of the compound\nH_atom_compound = (num_C_C * BE_C_C) + (num_C_eq_C * BE_C_eq_C) + (num_C_H * BE_C_H)\n\n# 2. Enthalpy of atomization of the elements\nH_atom_elements = (num_C_atoms * H_atom_C) + (num_H2_mols * BE_H_H)\n\n# 3. Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nH_f_mol = H_atom_elements - H_atom_compound\n\n# 4. Molar mass of C12H22 (g/mol)\nmolar_mass = 12 * 12 + 22 * 1\n\n# 5. Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g\nH_f_g = H_f_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {H_f_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {H_f_g}\")\n```\n<execute_return>\nstdout:\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n</execute_return>\nThe calculation confirms that the enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. When converted to kJ/g, the value is approximately 11.44 kJ/g. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The calculation of the enthalpy of formation involves several steps based on the principles of thermochemistry and bond energies.\n\n### **1. Molecular Formula and Structure Analysis**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the chemical formula and the types and numbers of bonds in the molecule: (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂.\n\n*   **Counting Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (from (CH₃)₂) + 1 (from C=) + 1 (from =CH) + 1 (from -CH₂-) + 1 (from -CH) + 1 (from (CH₃)) + 1 (from -CH₂-) + 1 (from -CH=) + 1 (from =C) + 2 (from (CH₃)₂) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Counting Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (from (CH₃)₂) + 1 (from =CH) + 2 (from -CH₂-) + 1 (from -CH) + 3 (from (CH₃)) + 2 (from -CH₂-) + 1 (from -CH=) + 6 (from (CH₃)₂) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n\n### **2. Counting the Bonds**\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of covalent bond within one molecule.\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two carbon-carbon double bonds in the structure: (CH₃)₂**C=CH**- and -**CH=C**(CH₃)₂. This gives **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic (non-cyclic) molecule, the total number of carbon-carbon links (single, double, etc.) is one less than the number of carbon atoms.\n    *   Total C-C links = 12 - 1 = 11.\n    *   Since we have 2 C=C bonds, the number of C-C single bonds is the remainder: 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Summary of Bonds:**\n*   9 C-C bonds\n*   2 C=C bonds\n*   22 C-H bonds\n\n### **3. Calculating the Enthalpy of Atomization (ΔH_atom)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) can be calculated using the following relationship:\nΔH_f = (Σ Enthalpies of atomization of reactants) - (Σ Bond energies of products)\n\n*   **Step 3a: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization for Reactants**\n    The formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n    12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)\n\n    The energy required to turn these reactants into gaseous atoms is:\n    *   Energy for Carbon: 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n    *   Energy for Hydrogen: 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n    *   **Total Reactant Atomization Enthalpy = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ**\n\n*   **Step 3b: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization for the Product (the molecule)**\n    This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous product.\n    *   Energy from C-C bonds: 9 × BE(C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n    *   Energy from C=C bonds: 2 × BE(C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n    *   Energy from C-H bonds: 22 × BE(C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n    *   **Total Product Atomization Enthalpy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ** (This corresponds to option D, but it's not the final answer).\n\n### **4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nNow we combine the results from Step 3.\nΔH_f = (Total Reactant Atomization Enthalpy) - (Total Product Atomization Enthalpy)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **5. Unit Conversion**\n\nThe calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. We must check the options.\n*   A) 67.4 kJ/mol (Incorrect)\n*   B) 1900 kJ/g (Incorrect unit, though the numerical value matches our intermediate result)\n*   C) 11.44 kJ/g\n*   D) 11200 kJ/mol (Incorrect, this is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\n\nSince option C is given in kJ/g, we need to convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g. For this, we need the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂.\n\n*   Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂ = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n*   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.445 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
