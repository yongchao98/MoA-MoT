    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula of Z.\n    *   The mass fraction of Carbon is 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   Let's find the ratio of moles of H to C. Assuming 100g of substance, we have 14.28 g of H and 85.72 g of C.\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol.\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.011 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol.\n    *   The ratio of H atoms to C atoms is approximately 14.17 / 7.14 ≈ 2.\n    *   Alternatively, using the approximation C=12 and H=1, a mass fraction of H of 14.28% is very close to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CnHx, the mass fraction of H is `x / (12n + x)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7x = 12n + x`, which simplifies to `6x = 12n`, or `x = 2n`.\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). An acyclic saturated hydrocarbon is an alkane (CnH2n+2), and a cyclic saturated hydrocarbon is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y contains two liquids, let's call them C and D, in an equimolar ratio.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This implies that C and D are saturated compounds. However, aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene also do not decolorize bromine water under standard test conditions, so they are a possibility.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's say C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of C (which is Z) naturally gives Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of D must also give Z. If D were a saturated isomer of Z (like methylcyclopentane is to cyclohexane), this would be possible via isomerization under severe conditions. However, a more elegant solution exists if we consider aromatic compounds. Aromatic compounds are \"unsaturated\" in structure but \"saturated\" in the bromine water test. They readily hydrogenate to the corresponding cycloalkane.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that D is the aromatic derivative corresponding to the cycloalkane Z.\n        *   If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then D would be benzene (C6H6).\n        *   If Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), then D would be toluene (C7H8).\n    *   This hypothesis is strong because hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of toluene gives methylcyclohexane. Thus, hydrogenation of Y = {cyclohexane, benzene} gives only cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of Y = {methylcyclohexane, toluene} gives only methylcyclohexane. This fits all the conditions for Y.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X contains two liquids, A and B, in an equimolar ratio.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B contain C=C or C≡C bonds.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z. This is a crucial clue: it means that both A and B must have the same carbon skeleton, and this skeleton is that of Z.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation that produces an equimolar mixture. This suggests a 1:1 reaction: A + B → C + D.\n\n4.  **Construct the Reaction**\n    *   Let's combine our findings. We have a reaction where A and B react to form C and D in a 1:1 ratio.\n        `A + B → C + D`\n    *   Let's test the C6 case: Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n        *   Y = {cyclohexane (C), benzene (D)}. So C = C6H12 and D = C6H6.\n        *   The reaction is `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`. To balance atoms, A and B must be C6 compounds, and the total atom count must match. The products have C12 and H18. So A+B must be C12H18.\n        *   Since A and B must hydrogenate to cyclohexane, they must be C6 compounds with a six-membered ring. Let's find two such compounds whose formulas sum to C12H18. The most plausible candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   `C6H10 + C6H8` gives C12H18. This matches.\n        *   The specific diene must be non-conjugated. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated. So, B must be cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n        *   Let's propose the final set of compounds:\n            *   X = {cyclohexene (A, C6H10), cyclohexa-1,4-diene (B, C6H8)}\n            *   Y = {cyclohexane (C, C6H12), benzene (D, C6H6)}\n            *   Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   This system fits all the conditions of the problem perfectly. The reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6` is a known type of hydrogen transfer reaction, driven by the formation of the stable aromatic ring, and it qualifies as a disproportionation.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Liquid A is cyclohexene, C6H10, which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid B is cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C6H8, which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n*(Self-correction: A similar consistent scenario can be constructed for the C7 case (Z=methylcyclohexane), leading to a total H count of 22. However, the cyclohexane/benzene system is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of transformation, making it the most likely intended answer in a chemistry problem of this nature.)*\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>"
