    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe goal is to identify Compound X (C11H12O), which upon reaction with DABCO at 403 K, yields a product with the given ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product from NMR Spectra**\n\nThe reaction is conducted at high temperature with a non-nucleophilic base (DABCO), suggesting an isomerization or rearrangement of Compound X. Therefore, the product should also have the molecular formula C11H12O.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n    *   **δ 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C):** These eight signals are in the sp² region (120-150 ppm), indicating an aromatic ring (6 carbons) and a C=C double bond (2 carbons). The fact that two signals account for two carbons each (126.9 and 129.1) suggests symmetry, such as a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C) and 28.4 (1C):** These are two aliphatic carbons, likely methyl groups.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   Total integration: 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 12 protons. This matches the H count in C11H12O.\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s):** Two sharp singlets, each integrating to 3H. This indicates two methyl (CH₃) groups with no adjacent protons.\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic signature of a 1,4- (para-) disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d):** Two doublets in the vinyl/aromatic region, each integrating to 1H. These are likely two protons on a disubstituted C=C double bond, coupled only to each other. This suggests a trans `–CH=CH–` group.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a ketone (C=O).\n    2.  We have two methyl groups that are singlets. One must be the methyl of an acetyl group `(-C(=O)-CH₃)` to be a singlet. The other must be attached to a quaternary carbon, likely the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    3.  This gives us a `p-tolyl` (4-methylphenyl) group and an acetyl group.\n    4.  We also have a `–CH=CH–` group.\n    5.  Let's assemble these fragments: `(p-tolyl) - (CH=CH) - (C(=O)-CH₃)`.\n    6.  The structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    7.  Let's verify this structure against the data:\n        *   Molecular Formula: C11H12O. Correct.\n        *   ¹H NMR: A methyl group on the aromatic ring (p-tolyl-CH₃, singlet), an acetyl methyl group (-CO-CH₃, singlet), two aromatic protons ortho to the methyl group (doublet), two aromatic protons ortho to the vinyl group (doublet), and two vinyl protons (each a doublet from coupling to each other). This perfectly matches the observed spectrum. The deshielding of some aromatic and vinyl protons is due to conjugation with the electron-withdrawing ketone group.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: The conjugated ketone, the 8 sp² carbons of the tolyl and vinyl groups, and the two methyl carbons all fit.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound X by Eliminating Options**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization, meaning no atoms are added or removed. Therefore, the starting material (Compound X) must have the same molecular formula (C11H12O) and the same core fragments that are not involved in the rearrangement. The `p-tolyl` group is a stable aromatic system and is highly unlikely to be formed during this reaction. Thus, Compound X must also contain a `p-tolyl` group.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** The \"styryl\" group is derived from styrene, meaning it contains a phenyl group (`C₆H₅-`), not a tolyl group (`CH₃-C₆H₄-`). So, this cannot be Compound X.\n*   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** This also contains a phenyl group. Furthermore, its molecular formula is C10H10O, which is incorrect. So, this cannot be Compound X.\n*   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:**\n    *   The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `(CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-`, which contains the required `p-tolyl` unit.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula. 4-methylstyryl group is C9H9. Oxirane attached at C2 (`-CH-O-CH₂`) is C2H3O. Total formula: C(9+2)H(9+3)O = C11H12O. This matches.\n    *   This is a plausible candidate. The reaction would be the isomerization of this vinyloxirane. While the exact mechanism to get the ketone product instead of the more commonly expected aldehyde is complex (likely involving initial rearrangement to a β,γ-unsaturated aldehyde followed by base-catalyzed conjugation to the more stable α,β-unsaturated ketone), this is the only option that contains the correct atoms and the conserved `p-tolyl` moiety.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound contains a phenyl group, not a tolyl group. So, this cannot be Compound X.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy identifying the product's structure from the NMR data and using the principle of conservation of atoms and major structural fragments in an isomerization reaction, we can definitively eliminate options A, B, and D. Option C is the only one with the correct molecular formula and the necessary `p-tolyl` group that is observed in the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
