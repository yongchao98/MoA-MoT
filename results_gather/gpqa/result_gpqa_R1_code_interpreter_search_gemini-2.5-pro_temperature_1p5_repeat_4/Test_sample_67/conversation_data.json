    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **System:** A spin-1/2 particle. Its state can be described by a 2D complex vector (a spinor).\n*   **Magnetic Moment:** The magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to the spin `S`, given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The notation `mu (= gamma*Sz)` is a common shorthand, implying the relationship is vectorial, `μ = γS`. If we interpreted it literally, the problem would lead to a non-oscillating result, which contradicts the question's premise.\n*   **Initial Field and Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is `B_initial = (0, 0, B)`. The Hamiltonian of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `H = -μ · B`.\n    *   `H_initial = -γS · B_initial = -γB S_z`.\n*   **Initial State:** The particle's moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the eigenstates of `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` and spin-down `|-z>`.\n    *   `S_z |+z> = +(ħ/2) |+z>` -> Energy `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>` -> Energy `E_- = +γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   The lower energy state is `|+z>`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   **New Field and Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is abruptly switched to the +Y direction. The new field is `B_new = (0, B, 0)`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t ≥ 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γS · (0, B, 0) = -γB S_y`.\n*   The system's state `|ψ(t)>` will now evolve according to this new Hamiltonian.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe time evolution of a quantum state is governed by the Schrödinger equation, which gives:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i H_new t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\nSubstituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) |+z> = exp(iγB S_y t / ħ) |+z>`\n\nThis operator describes a rotation of the spin state around the Y-axis. The angle of rotation is `θ(t) = -γBt`. The precession of the spin has begun.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\nWe need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`. To find `<S_z(t)>`, we calculate `<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\nThere are several ways to do this. A very direct method relies on the energy difference in the new system.\n\n**Method: Using Energy Eigenstates of the New Hamiltonian**\n\n1.  The new Hamiltonian is `H_new = -γB S_y`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we'll call `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   `S_y |+y> = +(ħ/2) |+y>` -> Energy `E_{+y} = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `S_y |-y> = -(ħ/2) |-y>` -> Energy `E_{-y} = +γB(ħ/2)`\n\n2.  We express the initial state `|+z>` in terms of the new energy eigenstates:\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) |+y> + (1/√2) |-y>`\n\n3.  The state at time `t` is the time-evolved superposition:\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) exp(-iE_{+y} t/ħ) |+y> + (1/√2) exp(-iE_{-y} t/ħ) |-y>`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) exp(iγBt/2) |+y> + (1/√2) exp(-iγBt/2) |-y>`\n\n4.  The expectation value of an observable `A` in such a superposition will oscillate at a frequency `ω` determined by the energy difference `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y}`.\n    *   `ΔE = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n\n5.  The oscillation frequency is given by the Bohr frequency condition `ω = ΔE / ħ`.\n    *   `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\nThis angular frequency `ω` is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nLet's confirm this by completing the full calculation for `<S_z(t)>`:\nFirst, express `|ψ(t)>` back in the z-basis:\n`|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\nThen, calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`:\n`<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * S_z * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n`<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * ( (ħ/2)cos(γBt/2)|+z> + (ħ/2)sin(γBt/2)|-z> )`\nUsing the orthogonality of `|+z>` and `|-z>`, this simplifies to:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\nFinally, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe time-dependent part is `cos(ωt)` where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
