    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents have the following relationships:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern is often challenging to synthesize due to competing directing effects of the substituents. A successful synthesis must carefully control the order of reactions and regiochemistry.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-director. Very bulky, so it often favors para substitution sterically.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director. (Precursor to -OEt).\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director. In acidic conditions, it forms the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director. Crucially, it is a reversible reaction and the group can be removed (desulfonation) with dilute acid and heat. This makes it an excellent **blocking group**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Pathways**\n\nWe must find a sequence that produces the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern in high yield.\n\n*   **Initial Alkylation vs. Nitration:** Friedel-Crafts reactions (like adding the -tBu group) fail on strongly deactivated rings. Therefore, nitration or sulfonation must not be the first step if we want to perform a Friedel-Crafts reaction later. All plausible sequences must start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene. This immediately casts doubt on option C, which starts with nitration.\n\n*   **Challenge of Direct Substitution:**\n    *   Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields mostly the para product (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) due to sterics. The ortho isomer, which has the tBu and NO2 groups ortho, is a minor product (~15-20%), so this is not a \"high-yield\" starting point.\n    *   If we were to nitrate 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene as a final step, both the -OEt and -tBu groups are o,p-directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not the sterically hindered position 3.\n\nThis suggests that a more sophisticated strategy involving a blocking group is necessary to achieve the desired regiochemistry.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis of Option D**\n\nLet's analyze the sequence in option D, which seems the most strategically sound, despite some apparent confusion in the order of later steps. The key is recognizing the use of the sulfonic acid group as a blocking group to control the position of the nitro group.\n\n**i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*Reaction: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation*\n\n**ii) `SO3/H2SO4`:** tert-butylbenzene is sulfonated. The bulky t-butyl group is an o,p-director, but sterically favors substitution at the para position.\n*Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This step is high-yield and \"blocks\" the para position.\n\n**iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   The -tBu group at C4 directs ortho (to C3 and C5).\n*   The -SO3H group at C1 directs meta (to C3 and C5).\n*   The directing effects are **concordant**, meaning they both direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 and C5, which are equivalent).\n*Product: **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a high-yield reaction that successfully places the t-butyl and nitro groups ortho to each other, a key feature of the final product.\n\n**(Note:** At this point, let's consider a known synthetic trick. If we were to take the product from step (iii) and treat it with dilute acid and heat (desulfonation, step viii), we would get **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. This entire sequence (i -> ii -> iii -> viii) is a classic, high-yield method to produce the ortho-nitroalkylbenzene, avoiding the low-yield direct nitration. This confirms that the reagents in option D are appropriate for the synthesis, even if the sequence as written seems convoluted.)\n\nLet's continue to analyze the sequence *as written* in option D, as this is what the question asks. The sequence listed appears flawed, particularly at step (vi). It's highly probable there is a typo in the question's sequence and that a logical reordering of the steps is intended. Based on the powerful and correct strategy embedded in the choice of reagents in D, it remains the most plausible answer. No other option presents a viable method for obtaining the required ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and a nitro group in high yield. The initial steps of D are strategically perfect for solving the core chemical problem.\n\n*   **Steps iv-ix:** The remaining steps (`Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `HNO3/H2SO4`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `dilute H2SO4`, `NaOH/EtBr`) are a collection of reagents to convert the installed functional groups (`-NO2`, `-SO3H`) into the final groups (`-NO2`, `-OEt`) with the correct arrangement. While the listed order is problematic, the set of reagents is correct for a multi-step synthesis involving reduction of a nitro group, diazotization, conversion to a phenol, etherification, and removal of the blocking group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because the reaction sequence is chemically impossible (e.g., diazotization before reduction).\n*   **Option B** leads to the wrong isomer (1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene) unless a speculative and likely low-yield rearrangement occurs.\n*   **Option C** is incorrect because it starts with nitration, which prevents the subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   **Option D** employs the correct and most powerful strategy (using a sulfonic acid blocking group) to create the required ortho-nitro-tert-butyl arrangement, which is the most challenging part of the synthesis. Although the latter half of the sequence appears jumbled or to contain a typo, the reagents and the initial strategy are the only ones presented that could plausibly lead to a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\nTherefore, sequence D outlines the necessary transformations, making it the best choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
