    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Given:** A relationship for the number of stars as a function of parallax (`plx`). Specifically, \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\".\n    *   **To Find:** The relationship for the number of stars as a function of distance (`r`). Specifically, how the number of stars \"change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\".\n    *   **Implicit Information:** The physical relationship between distance and parallax.\n\n2.  **Translate the Phrases into Mathematical Expressions:**\n    *   \"The number of stars ... per unit range of distance, r\" is the differential quantity `dN/dr`. This represents the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `r`.\n    *   \"The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\" most likely refers to the number of stars per unit parallax interval. This is the density function in parallax space, which is the differential quantity `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   So, the given information is `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`. Let's write this as `dN/d(plx) = C * plx^(-5)`, where C is a constant of proportionality.\n    *   We need to find the functional form of `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Establish the Connection between Variables:**\n    *   The parallax (`plx`) of a star is, by definition, inversely proportional to its distance (`r`). The simplest form of this relationship is `plx = 1/r`.\n    *   From this, we can also write `r = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan to Convert the Density Functions:**\n    *   We want to convert a function of `plx` into a function of `r`. The chain rule from calculus is the perfect tool for this.\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in a small interval is the same regardless of whether we measure it using distance or parallax. This means `dN = (dN/dr) * dr` must equal `dN = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`.\n    *   We can write: `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`.\n    *   Since the number of stars (`dN`) and the interval (`dr`) must be positive, we should use the absolute value of the derivative `|d(plx)/dr|` to ensure the density `dN/dr` is positive. This is the standard procedure when changing variables for probability densities.\n    *   The equation is: `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`.\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan (Calculations):**\n    *   **Step 1: Find the derivative `d(plx)/dr`**.\n        *   `plx = 1/r = r^(-1)`\n        *   Using the power rule for differentiation: `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r^(-1-1) = -r^(-2) = -1/r^2`.\n    *   **Step 2: Find the absolute value.**\n        *   `|d(plx)/dr| = |-1/r^2| = 1/r^2`.\n    *   **Step 3: Substitute the known parts back into the conversion formula.**\n        *   We have `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx^(-5)` and `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2`.\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ plx^(-5) * (1/r^2)`.\n    *   **Step 4: Express everything in terms of the desired variable, `r`**.\n        *   Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression.\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ (1/r)^(-5) * (1/r^2)`.\n    *   **Step 5: Simplify the expression.**\n        *   `(1/r)^(-5) = r^5`.\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ r^5 * (1/r^2) = r^5 * r^(-2)`.\n        *   Using the rule of exponents `x^a * x^b = x^(a+b)`:\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ r^(5 - 2) = r^3`.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion and Answer Selection:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to `r^3`.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        *   A) ~ r^4\n        *   B) ~ r^3\n        *   C) ~ r^2\n        *   D) ~ r^5\n    *   The calculated result matches option B.\n\n7.  **(Self-Correction/Double Check):**\n    *   Let's check the logic in reverse. If `dN/dr ∝ r^3`, what is `dN/d(plx)`?\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = (dN/dr) * |dr/d(plx)|`.\n    *   `r = 1/plx`, so `dr/d(plx) = -1/plx^2`. `|dr/d(plx)| = 1/plx^2`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ r^3 * (1/plx^2)`.\n    *   Substitute `r = 1/plx`: `dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/plx)^3 * (1/plx^2) = 1/plx^3 * 1/plx^2 = 1/plx^5`.\n    *   This matches the given information in the problem. The derivation is consistent and correct.\n\n<<<B>>>"
