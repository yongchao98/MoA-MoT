    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 C=C\n               H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The epoxidation is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. A *trans*-alkene will yield a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the reaction must produce an achiral product or a racemic mixture of chiral products. Attacking the planar alkene from the top face or the bottom face results in two different products that are mirror images of each other. These are the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers of 4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Product of epoxidation: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by water on the protonated epoxide. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen (an Sₙ2-like backside attack), resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two -OH groups.\n\n4.  **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-dihydroxylation on a *trans*-alkene. There is a useful mnemonic for this: \"**T**rans-**A**nti-**M**eso\" (TAM). When the alkene is symmetrically substituted (as oct-4-ene is), a *trans*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide via backside attack by water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (R → S), giving (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has two stereocenters but also has a center of inversion, making it a *meso* compound and therefore achiral.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 C=C\n               H     H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene yields a *cis*-epoxide. In this case, the product is cis-4,5-epoxyoctane. This epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is a *meso* compound.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs the same *anti*-dihydroxylation as in Reaction 1.\n\n4.  **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-dihydroxylation on a *cis*-alkene. The mnemonic here is \"**C**is-**A**nti-**E**nantiomers\" (CAE). A symmetrically substituted *cis*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify: Opening the *meso*-epoxide (let's say it's 4R,5S) via backside attack.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) causes inversion, resulting in (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) causes inversion, resulting in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\nNow, let's predict the chromatograms:\n\n**A) Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n*   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n    *   One peak for the meso-diol.\n    *   One peak for the co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   **Total Peaks on standard HPLC: 2**\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   Diastereomers will also be separated.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n    *   One peak for the meso-diol (it is a diastereomer to the other two).\n    *   One peak for the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   One peak for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   **Total Peaks on chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
