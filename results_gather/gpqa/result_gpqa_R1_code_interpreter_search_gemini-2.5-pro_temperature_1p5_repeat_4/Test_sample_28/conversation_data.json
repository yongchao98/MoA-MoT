    "An effective way to eliminate a compound synthesized by a gene is to introduce a mutation that renders the gene's protein product non-functional. We need to analyze each mutation to determine which is most likely to cause a complete loss of function.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** The gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`. `ATG` is the start codon, initiating protein translation. We will translate the beginning of the intact gene to establish a baseline.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n    *   Intact protein starts: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Mutant:** We will compare each mutant sequence to the intact sequence to identify the type of mutation and predict its effect on the resulting protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Intact: `...ATG TTT CTC...` (Met-Phe-Leu)\n        *   Mutant 1: `...ATG TTC TAC...`\n        *   Change 1: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **synonymous (silent) mutation**.\n        *   Change 2: `CTC` -> `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid.\n        *   **Effect:** A single amino acid change might affect protein function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is less likely to cause a complete knockout compared to more drastic mutations.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Intact: `...ATG TTT CTC...` (Met-Phe-Leu)\n        *   Mutant 2: `...ATG TTC TAA...`\n        *   Change 1: `TTT` -> `TTC`. As in Mutant 1, this is a silent mutation.\n        *   Change 2: `CTC` -> `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon at the third position. Translation will halt, producing a tiny, non-functional dipeptide (Met-Phe). This is a very effective way to knock out gene function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Intact: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCT...`\n        *   Mutant 3: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCT...`\n        *   Comparing the sequences reveals an insertion of a single thymine ('T') nucleotide after the sixth base.\n        *   Intact codons: `ATG | TTT | CTC | GCT...`\n        *   Mutant 3 codons: `ATG | TTT | TAC | GCT...` Wait, let's re-examine this.\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT...`\n        *   Mutant 3: `ATG TTT T ACG CTG...`\n        *   This insertion of a 'T' causes a **frameshift mutation**. The reading frame is altered, and every subsequent codon is read differently. The resulting amino acid sequence will be completely scrambled from that point on, almost certainly leading to a non-functional protein, likely with a premature stop codon appearing by chance downstream.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Intact: `...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n        *   Mutant 4: `...TAC GCT ACT...`\n        *   This mutation involves two changes: a substitution (`CTC` to `TAC`, a missense mutation changing Leu to Tyr) and a deletion of one full codon (`GGT`, which codes for Glycine).\n        *   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid, combined with a missense mutation. While this will alter the protein, the reading frame remains intact. The rest of the protein is synthesized correctly. This is less likely to completely abolish function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe are looking for the mutation most likely to eliminate the protein's function. Let's rank the mutations by the severity of their impact:\n1.  **Mutant 2 (Nonsense mutation):** Introduces a stop codon at the 3rd amino acid position. Guarantees a severely truncated, non-functional protein.\n2.  **Mutant 3 (Frameshift mutation):** Scrambles the entire protein sequence from the 3rd amino acid onward. Also extremely likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n3.  **Mutant 4 (In-frame deletion + Missense):** Removes one amino acid and changes another. The protein is altered but might retain some function.\n4.  **Mutant 1 (Missense mutation):** Changes one amino acid. This has the highest chance of having only a minor impact or no impact on function.\n\nBoth the nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and the frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are strong candidates for creating a null allele (a non-functional version of a gene). However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is arguably the most direct and certain method of knockout presented. It forces translation to stop almost immediately, leaving no chance for the production of a partially functional protein. Therefore, it is the most probable choice for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
