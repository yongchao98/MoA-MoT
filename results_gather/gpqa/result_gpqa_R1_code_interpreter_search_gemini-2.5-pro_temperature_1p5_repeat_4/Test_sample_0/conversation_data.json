    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle**: The problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty in its energy. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) is on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\n    \n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    \n    For estimations like this, we can approximate it as:\n    \n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n    \n    Here, ΔE represents the natural \"width\" or \"fuzziness\" of the energy level. A shorter lifetime (Δt) leads to a larger, more uncertain energy width (ΔE).\n\n2.  **Define \"Clearly Resolved\"**: To clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, E1 and E2, the difference in their energies (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than their individual energy widths. The most critical factor is the *larger* of the two energy widths, as it creates the most significant overlap. If the separation is smaller than this width, the two levels will blend into each other.\n    \n    Therefore, the condition for resolution is:\n    \n    |E1 - E2| > max(ΔE1, ΔE2)\n\n3.  **Identify the Lifetimes**:\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (Δt1) = 10⁻⁹ sec\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (Δt2) = 10⁻⁸ sec\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainties (ΔE1 and ΔE2)**: We need to calculate the energy width for each state using the uncertainty principle. We will need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of electron-volts times seconds (eV·s) to get the energy in eV.\n    \n    *   Value of ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    Now, let's calculate the energy widths using a python script.\n    ```python\n    # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n    h_bar = 6.582119569e-16\n    \n    # Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\n    dt1 = 1e-9\n    dt2 = 1e-8\n    \n    # Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state\n    dE1 = h_bar / dt1\n    dE2 = h_bar / dt2\n    \n    print(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (dE1): {dE1:.4e} eV\")\n    print(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (dE2): {dE2:.4e} eV\")\n    \n    # The minimum required energy separation is determined by the larger uncertainty\n    larger_uncertainty = max(dE1, dE2)\n    print(f\"The larger energy uncertainty is: {larger_uncertainty:.4e} eV\")\n    ```\n\n5.  **Analyze the Results**:\n    *   From the calculation, the energy uncertainty for the first state (ΔE1) is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   The energy uncertainty for the second state (ΔE2) is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    \n    The first state has a shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s), so it has a larger energy uncertainty (linewidth). To resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be greater than this larger uncertainty.\n    \n    Required Energy Difference > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options**:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n    Let's check which option satisfies the condition:\n    \n    *   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV**: This is much greater than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This separation is large enough for the levels to be clearly resolved.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV**: This is smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap too much.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV**: This is much smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap too much.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁸ eV**: This is also smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap too much.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Only an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than the natural linewidth of the shorter-lived state, allowing the two energy levels to be distinguished.\n\n<<<A>>>"
