    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic feature of an O-H stretching vibration, broadened by hydrogen bonding. This strongly suggests the presence of either an alcohol (-OH) or a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group in a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Intermediate Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of a broad O-H peak and a C=O peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ confirms the presence of an alkene group. Therefore, the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid (an alkenoic acid).\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 2(16) + 1 = 45 amu.\nThis piece of evidence further solidifies the conclusion that the compound contains a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **4. Determining the Chemical Formula**\nNow we must find the formula that matches our identified structural features: a **carboxylic acid** and an **alkene**.\n\n*   **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₀O) and D (C₆H₁₂O), which only have one oxygen atom. The correct formula must be either A (C₆H₁₀O₂) or C (C₆H₁₂O₂).\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. We can calculate the DoU from the structural features and from the chemical formula.\n\n    *   **DoU from structure:**\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   **Total required DoU = 1 + 1 = 2**.\n\n    *   **DoU from formula (using DoU = C - H/2 + 1):**\n        *   For **C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option A)**: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**.\n        *   For **C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option C)**: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**.\n\n*   **Comparison:** The required degree of unsaturation (DoU = 2) based on the spectroscopic evidence perfectly matches the calculated DoU for the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**. The formula C₆H₁₂O₂ (DoU = 1) would represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence of a C=C double bond.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the chemical formula C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the degree of unsaturation for a given chemical formula.\n    Formula should be a string like 'C6H12O'.\n    \"\"\"\n    import re\n    C = int(re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula).group(1)) if re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula) else 0\n    H = int(re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula).group(1)) if re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula) else 0\n    \n    # The general formula is DoU = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1. \n    # For CHO compounds, it simplifies to C - H/2 + 1.\n    dou = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return dou\n\nformulas_to_check = ['C6H10O2', 'C6H12O2']\nprint(\"Analysis of Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(\"Spectroscopic evidence requires:\")\nprint(\" - 1 DoU for the carboxylic acid (C=O)\")\nprint(\" - 1 DoU for the alkene (C=C)\")\nprint(\"Total Required DoU = 2\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(\"Calculating DoU for the two possible formulas:\")\nfor f in formulas_to_check:\n    dou = calculate_dou(f)\n    print(f\"Formula: {f}, Calculated DoU: {int(dou)}\")\n\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(\"Conclusion: C6H10O2 is the only formula with a DoU of 2, matching the evidence.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Final Answer Rationale:**\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:** The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The presence of two oxygen atoms is implied. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), meaning the molecule is unsaturated.\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:** The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of the C=C double bond suggested by the FTIR data.\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:** A fragment at m/z = 45 is the mass of the carboxyl cation ([COOH]⁺), providing strong confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n4.  **Formula Determination:**\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must have two oxygen atoms. This narrows the choices down to **A) C₆H₁₀O₂** and **C) C₆H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) must account for both the C=O bond in the acid and the C=C bond of the alkene. This means the molecule has a DoU of 2.\n    *   Calculating the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This matches the spectroscopic evidence.\n        *   **C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the data is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
