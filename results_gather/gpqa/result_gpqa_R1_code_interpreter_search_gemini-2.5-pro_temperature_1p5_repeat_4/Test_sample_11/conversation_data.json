    "This is a particle decay problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in special relativity.\n\n**1. Identify the process and given values:**\n- The decay is: Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n- The initial particle, the positive pion (Pi+), is stationary.\n- Rest mass-energy of Pi(+) (m_π*c²): 139.6 MeV\n- Rest mass-energy of mu(+) (m_μ*c²): 105.7 MeV\n- The neutrino (nu) is a muon neutrino (ν_μ). In such problems, its rest mass is considered to be effectively zero (m_ν*c² ≈ 0).\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    -   Initial Energy (E_initial): Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest energy.\n        E_initial = m_π*c²\n    -   Final Energy (E_final): The total energy of the two product particles.\n        E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n        Where E_μ is the total energy of the muon and E_ν is the total energy of the neutrino. The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy (KE).\n        E_μ = m_μ*c² + KE_μ\n        E_ν = m_ν*c² + KE_ν ≈ KE_ν (since m_ν ≈ 0)\n    -   So, the energy conservation equation is:\n        m_π*c² = (m_μ*c² + KE_μ) + KE_ν\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before must equal the total momentum after.\n    -   Initial Momentum (p_initial): Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero.\n        p_initial = 0\n    -   Final Momentum (p_final): The vector sum of the momenta of the products. For the total to be zero, the two particles must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\n        p_final = p_μ + p_ν = 0\n        This implies |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p.\n\n**3. Derivation and Calculation:**\n\nWe can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²\n\nFor the neutrino (massless):\nE_ν² = (p*c)² + 0  =>  E_ν = p*c\nSince for a massless particle E_ν = KE_ν, we have:\nKE_ν = p*c\n\nNow let's use the conservation of energy equation:\nm_π*c² = E_μ + E_ν\nm_π*c² = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²) + p*c\n\nSubstitute KE_ν for p*c:\nm_π*c² = sqrt((KE_ν)² + (m_μ*c²)²) + KE_ν\nm_π*c² - KE_ν = sqrt((KE_ν)² + (m_μ*c²)²)\n\nSquare both sides to remove the square root:\n(m_π*c² - KE_ν)² = (KE_ν)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n(m_π*c²)² - 2*(m_π*c²)*KE_ν + (KE_ν)² = (KE_ν)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\nThe (KE_ν)² term cancels on both sides:\n(m_π*c²)² - 2*(m_π*c²)*KE_ν = (m_μ*c²)²\n\nNow, solve for KE_ν:\n(m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² = 2*(m_π*c²)*KE_ν\nKE_ν = [ (m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² ] / [ 2 * m_π*c² ]\n\nOnce we find KE_ν, we can easily find KE_μ. The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value of the reaction) is the difference between the initial and final rest energies:\nQ = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_π*c² - m_μ*c²\nTherefore:\nKE_μ = (m_π*c² - m_μ*c²) - KE_ν\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass-energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) using the derived formula.\n# We can drop the c^2 terms as they cancel out, using the mass-energy values directly.\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu) is the Q-value minus the neutrino's kinetic energy.\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\n# The question asks for the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n# Let's print the values for the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu) respectively.\nprint(f\"KE of mu(+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of nu: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKE of mu(+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of nu: 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (mu+) and 29.8 MeV (when rounded) for the neutrino (nu).\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem describes the two-body decay of a stationary particle. To solve this, we will apply the principles of conservation of relativistic energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   The initial particle is a positive pion (Pi+) at rest.\n*   Initial total energy, E_initial = Rest energy of Pi+ = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Initial momentum, p_initial = 0, since the pion is stationary.\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   The final particles are a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu).\n*   Let the total energy and momentum of the muon be E_μ and p_μ.\n*   Let the total energy and momentum of the neutrino be E_ν and p_ν.\n*   The neutrino's rest mass is considered to be zero (m_ν ≈ 0).\n\n**3. Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    The total initial momentum is zero, so the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    p_initial = p_final\n    0 = **p**_μ + **p**_ν\n    This means the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this magnitude be 'p'.\n    |**p**_μ| = |**p**_ν| = p\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total initial energy equals the total final energy.\n    E_initial = E_final\n    m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**4. Using the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe relation is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\n\n*   For the neutrino (m_ν = 0):\n    E_ν² = (p*c)² + 0  =>  E_ν = p*c\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is purely kinetic energy: KE_ν = E_ν.\n    So, KE_ν = p*c\n\n*   For the muon (m_μ > 0):\n    E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    Substitute p*c = E_ν:\n    E_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μ * c²)²\n\n**5. Solving for the Energies:**\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν   =>   E_μ = m_π * c² - E_ν\n2.  E_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μ * c²)²\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n(m_π * c² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μ * c²)²\n\nExpand the left side:\n(m_π * c²)² - 2*(m_π * c²)*E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μ * c²)²\n\nThe E_ν² term cancels out on both sides. Now, we solve for E_ν (which is KE_ν):\n(m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)² = 2*(m_π * c²)*E_ν\n\nKE_ν = E_ν = [ (m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_π * c²) ]\n\n**6. Calculation:**\nPlug in the given values:\n*   m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n*   m_μ * c² = 105.7 MeV\n\nKE_ν = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\nKE_ν = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\nKE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2\nKE_ν ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\nNow, find the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ). The total kinetic energy released in the decay is the difference in rest masses:\nKE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_π * c² - m_μ * c²\nKE_total = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV\n\nSo, KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν\nKE_μ = 33.9 - 29.78\nKE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV (for mu+) and 29.8 MeV (for nu).\n\nComparing our result with the options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nOur calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
