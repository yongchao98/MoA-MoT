    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a single stereocenter at carbon 5, which has the (S) configuration. The structure is CH3-O-C*H(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3, where C* is the chiral center.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at carbon 3 to a secondary alcohol. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion can attack from two different faces, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, the reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. This results in the formation of two products which are diastereomers of each other.\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed. Let's call them Product A and Product B.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure of the product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and is therefore a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form (they are superimposable).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Let's call this Product C)\n    *   A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product D) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product E).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separation**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n*   **Product A:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Product B:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Product C:** meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Product D:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Product E:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow, let's determine how many peaks will be observed in each HPLC experiment.\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Stationary Phase)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity) and therefore cannot be separated. They co-elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and different polarities, so they can be separated.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   Products A and B are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Product C (meso) is a diastereomer of products D and E. Therefore, C will be separated from the D/E pair.\n    *   Products D and E are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   So, the products from Reaction II will give **two peaks** in total on a normal-phase column (one for C, one for the D+E pair).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different retention times.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\nA chiral stationary phase allows for the separation of enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   The mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers (A, B, C, D, E).\n*   Product A and Product B are diastereomers and will be resolved. (2 peaks)\n*   Product C is an achiral meso compound and will appear as a single peak.\n*   Product D and Product E are enantiomers, and the chiral column is designed to separate them. They will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   All five compounds (A, B, C, D, E) are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, resulting in different retention times.\n*   Therefore, all five stereoisomers will be separated.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
