    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Signals and Integrations:**\n*   There are four distinct signals in the spectrum.\n*   The integrations are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H, for a total of 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons in the molecule.\n\nLet's check the number of protons for each option:\n*   Propenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₃): C₅H₈O₂. It has 3+1+1+3 = 8 protons. This matches.\n*   Butenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH₂CH=CHCH₃): C₆H₁₀O₂. It has 3+2+1+1+3 = 10 protons. This does not match the integration data.\n\nTherefore, we can immediately rule out both Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate (options B and C). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Signal in Detail:**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to the acetate methyl group (CH₃COO-).\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This region is typical for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a double bond).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is split by one adjacent proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to the methyl group at the end of the propenyl chain (=CH-CH₃).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the alkene/vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** It is a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The \"doublet\" part means it is coupled to one proton. The \"quartet\" part means it is coupled to three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the vinylic proton adjacent to the methyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). It is split into a quartet by the CH₃ group (at 1.6 ppm) and into a doublet by the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region. It is further downfield (more deshielded) because it is directly attached to the carbon that is bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom of the ester (O-CH=).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** It is a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one adjacent proton, which must be the other vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the key piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. The magnitude of the J-coupling constant between two protons on a double bond is dependent on their geometry.\n        *   **Trans protons:** J-coupling is typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **Cis protons:** J-coupling is typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The observed J-value of 16.0 Hz is a classic value for *trans* vinylic protons.\n\n**3. Synthesize the Findings:**\n\n*   The molecule has an acetate group (CH₃COO-) and a propenyl group (-CH=CHCH₃).\n*   The two protons on the double bond show a coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, which definitively indicates a **trans** configuration.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."
