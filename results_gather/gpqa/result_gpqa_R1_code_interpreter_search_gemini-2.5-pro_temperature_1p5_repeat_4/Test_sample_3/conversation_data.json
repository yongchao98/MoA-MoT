    "In our universe, Maxwell's equations are a set of four fundamental equations that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. Let's look at them in their differential form:\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** ∇ ⋅ **E** = ρ / ε₀\n    *   This equation relates the divergence of the electric field (**E**) to the electric charge density (ρ). It states that electric field lines originate from or terminate on electric charges.\n\n2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** ∇ ⋅ **B** = 0\n    *   This equation states that the divergence of the magnetic field (**B**) is always zero. This is the mathematical expression of the fact that there are no magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles). Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.\n\n3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t\n    *   This equation relates the curl (or circulation) of the electric field (**E**) to a changing magnetic field (**B**).\n\n4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** ∇ × **B** = μ₀(**J** + ε₀ ∂**E**/∂t)\n    *   This equation relates the curl (or circulation) of the magnetic field (**B**) to electric currents (**J**) and changing electric fields (**E**).\n\nNow, let's consider the hypothetical universe where magnetic monopoles exist.\n\n*   **Change to Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** If an isolated north or south pole (a magnetic monopole) could exist, it would act as a source or sink for magnetic field lines, just like an electric charge is for electric field lines. This means the divergence of the magnetic field would no longer be zero. The equation would be modified to include a magnetic charge density term (let's call it ρ_m):\n    *   **New Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** ∇ ⋅ **B** = ρ_m (multiplied by some constant)\n    *   Therefore, the equation related to the **divergence of the magnetic field** must change.\n\n*   **Change to Faraday's Law of Induction:** If magnetic charges (monopoles) exist, they can also move, creating a \"magnetic current\" (let's call it **J**_m). Look at the symmetry in the original equations: an electric current (**J**) creates a circulating magnetic field (in Ampère's Law). Symmetrically, a magnetic current should create a circulating electric field. This means Faraday's Law must be modified to include this new magnetic current term:\n    *   **New Faraday's Law:** ∇ × **E** = - (∂**B**/∂t + a term for **J**_m)\n    *   Therefore, the equation related to the **circulation (curl) of the electric field** must also change.\n\nThe other two equations, Gauss's Law for Electricity and the Ampère-Maxwell Law, relate to electric charges and currents, which are not directly affected by the existence of magnetic monopoles. Thus, they would remain unchanged.\n\nBased on this analysis, the two equations that would change are:\n1.  The one dealing with the **divergence of the magnetic field** (Gauss's Law for Magnetism).\n2.  The one dealing with the **circulation of the electric field** (Faraday's Law).\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
