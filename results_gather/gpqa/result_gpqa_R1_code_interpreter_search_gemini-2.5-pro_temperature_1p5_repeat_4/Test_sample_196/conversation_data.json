  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Identify the structure of Compound X from the provided spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   `3400–2500 cm-1`: This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   `1720 cm-1`: This strong absorption is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   `1610 cm-1` and `1450 cm-1`: These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: The chemical shift and broad singlet nature are definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is due to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   The remaining signals describe the alkyl substituent:\n            *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to at least two different types of protons.\n            *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton suggests a methine group (-CH-) adjacent to the aromatic ring (causing a downfield shift) and other protons.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Let's put the pieces together. We have `CH₃-CH₂-` and `CH₃-CH-`. Combining them to fit the remaining signals (`-CH-` at 2.9 ppm and `-CH₂-` at 1.7 ppm) gives us the structure `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`. This is a *sec*-butyl group. The methine proton (at 2.9 ppm) is attached to the ring and is split by the adjacent methyl and methylene protons. The methylene protons (at 1.7 ppm) are split by the adjacent methine and methyl protons. The methyl group at 1.4 ppm is split into a doublet by the methine proton. The methyl group at 0.9 ppm is split into a triplet by the methylene protons. This interpretation fits all the data perfectly.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining the aromatic carboxylic acid part and the sec-butyl group in a para arrangement gives **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** Compound X is reacted with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent used for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups to alkanes. Specifically, it reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring is not reduced under these conditions.\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material (Compound X): 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n        *   Final Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This matches our deduced final product.\n    *   B) **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This is the starting material, Compound X.\n    *   C) **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This is incorrect; the alkyl group is isobutyl, not sec-butyl.\n    *   D) **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This structure is inconsistent with the spectral data and the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
