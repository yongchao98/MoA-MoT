    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This carbon is called the alpha-carbon (α-carbon), and the hydrogen is an alpha-hydrogen (α-hydrogen). The α-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered carbon ring with ketone groups (C=O) at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the α-carbons. They are sp³ hybridized and each has two α-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has sp³ α-carbons with α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it readily tautomerizes to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is highly stable due to aromaticity. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (specifically, 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds between positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. These α-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp² hybridized.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not have any α-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon. The requirement for standard keto-enol tautomerism is not met. Therefore, benzoquinone does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, will show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (or chiral center), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate *will* show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* configuration around the double bond:\n        ```\n          H      COOCH₃\n           \\    /\n            C==C\n           /    \\\n      CH₃OOC     H\n        ```\n    *   **Chirality:**\n        *   The molecule has no chiral centers (no carbon is attached to four different groups).\n        *   The molecule is largely planar and possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center) located at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the center of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on itself. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does **not** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Result for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Compilation**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism): **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism): **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
