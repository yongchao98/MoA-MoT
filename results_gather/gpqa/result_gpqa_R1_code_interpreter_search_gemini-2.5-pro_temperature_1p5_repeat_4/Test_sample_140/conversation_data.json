    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d (an aryl halide with a deuterium label) and sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base. These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The strong base, the amide ion (NH2⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n    *   In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C-1:\n        *   Position C-2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n        *   Position C-6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    *   This leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n        *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6.** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is kinetically favored (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n            1.  NH2⁻ removes the proton from C-6, creating a carbanion at that position.\n            2.  The carbanion intermediate quickly loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n            3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (If you renumber the benzyne so the triple bond is between C1 and C2, the deuterium is on C3).\n\n        *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2.** Although slower than H-abstraction, this pathway is still possible.\n            1.  NH2⁻ removes the deuteron from C-2, creating a carbanion at that position.\n            2.  This carbanion intermediate loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n            3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. Since the deuterium was removed in this process, the resulting intermediate is simply **benzyne**, with no deuterium atom.\n\n    *   So, two different benzyne intermediates are possible: **3-deuterobenzyne** (from Pathway A) and **benzyne** (from Pathway B).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2⁻), attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to give the final product.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the products from each intermediate:\n\n        *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Intermediate from Pathway A):**\n            *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6 (original numbering), and the deuterium is at C-2.\n            *   **Attack at C-1:** The NH2⁻ group adds to C-1. This places a negative charge on C-6. Protonation of C-6 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C-1 and the -D is at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or *o*-deuteroaniline).\n            *   **Attack at C-6:** The NH2⁻ group adds to C-6. This places a negative charge on C-1. Protonation of C-1 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C-6 and the -D is at C-2. Relative to the new -NH2 group, the deuterium is three carbons away. This is **3-deuteroaniline** (or *m*-deuteroaniline).\n            *   Thus, Pathway A leads to **two** different organic products.\n\n        *   **Products from benzyne (Intermediate from Pathway B):**\n            *   This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium.\n            *   Attack of NH2⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n            *   Thus, Pathway B leads to **one** organic product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Possible Products**\n    *   By considering all possible, chemically reasonable pathways, we identify three unique organic products:\n        1.  Aniline\n        2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n        3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\n    Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
