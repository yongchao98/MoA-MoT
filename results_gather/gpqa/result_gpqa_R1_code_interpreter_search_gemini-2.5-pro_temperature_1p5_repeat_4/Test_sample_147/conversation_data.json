    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the composition of substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YFz) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    Let My be the molar mass of element Y and Mf be the molar mass of fluorine (19.00 g/mol).\n    The formula for the mass percentage is: ɷF = (z * Mf) / (My + z * Mf)\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    0.3196 = (z * 19.00) / (My + z * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * My + 0.3196 * 19.00 * z = 19.00 * z\n    0.3196 * My + 6.0724 * z = 19.00 * z\n    0.3196 * My = 12.9276 * z\n    My = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * z\n    My ≈ 40.45 * z\n\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer z (the number of fluorine atoms) that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for z:\n    *   z=1: My ≈ 40.45 g/mol. This corresponds to Argon or Calcium, which are not known to form the described range of fluorides.\n    *   z=2: My ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (79.9 g/mol) or Selenium (79.0 g/mol). Bromine is a halogen itself, and its fluorides don't match the description. Selenium forms SeF4 and SeF6, not five compounds.\n    *   z=3: My ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol. This is a very strong candidate. Let's assume **Y=Sb** and **A2=SbF3**.\n    *   z=4: My ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is close to Terbium (158.9 g/mol) or Dysprosium (162.5 g/mol).\n    *   z=5: My ≈ 202.25 g/mol. This is near Gold (197.0), Mercury (200.6), or Bismuth (209.0).\n    *   z=6: My ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This matches the isotope Plutonium-242. However, solutions of plutonium compounds are known to be colored, which contradicts a later clue (\"colorless concentrated solution of A4\").\n\n2.  **Verify the mass percentage for A2=SbF3.**\n    MW(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188, or 31.88%.\n    This value (31.88%) is very close to the given value of 31.96%, confirming that Y=Sb and A2=SbF3 is a highly probable identification.\n\n3.  **Identify the other compounds based on Y=Sb.**\n    The known binary fluorides of antimony are SbF3 and SbF5. The problem states five compounds are known, which is a discrepancy. However, given the strong numerical match for Sb, we'll proceed by assuming the problem may be flawed in this descriptive detail or counts polymeric forms.\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2(SbF3) and fluorine. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride, so **A1=SbF5**. The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" does not match the known properties of SbF5 (colorless, stable liquid/solid). This is another likely flaw in the problem statement.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y(Sb) and reacts with Xenon. This can be SbF5. SbF5 is a powerful Lewis acid and reacts with xenon fluorides (e.g., XeF2 + SbF5 → [XeF]+[SbF6]−). So, **A3=SbF5**.\n\n4.  **Identify substance A4.**\n    The problem states: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   A4 is a fluoride of Antimony, so it is either SbF3 or SbF5.\n    *   Both SbF3 and SbF5 can form colorless solutions (e.g., in anhydrous HF).\n    *   The question is to find the molecular weight range of A4. Let's calculate the MW for both possibilities and check against the options.\n        *   **MW(SbF3)** = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n        *   **MW(SbF5)** = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Check the molecular weights against the given ranges.**\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 220-240\n    *   D) 160-180\n\n    *   The MW of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls squarely in range **D) 160-180**.\n    *   The MW of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit any of the ranges.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the strong numerical evidence, Y is Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF3. The only fluoride of antimony whose molecular weight fits one of the given ranges is SbF3. Therefore, **A4 must be SbF3**.\n    The reaction described (Sb + SbF3 → A5) is chemically problematic, as is the description of A1. However, given the multiple-choice format, the numerical coherence between the mass percentage of A2 and the molecular weight of A4 provides the only logical path to a unique answer among the options.\n\n    The molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is 178.76 g/mol, which lies in the range 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>"
