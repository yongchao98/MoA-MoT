    "This problem requires a systematic application of IUPAC nomenclature rules for substituted aromatic compounds.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core and Substituents:**\n    *   The core is a **benzene ring**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n        *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as 'formyl' when it's not the principal group.\n        *   Cyano (-CN), also known as nitrile.\n        *   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as 'hydroxy'.\n        *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n        *   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\n2.  **Determine the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group:**\n    According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has the highest priority among the given functional groups. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned position **C1**.\n\n3.  **Draw the Structure based on Positional Information:**\n    *   Start by placing the -COOH group at **C1**.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, **-OCH₃ is at C4**.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group\": The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, **-OH and -N(CH₃)₂ are at C2 and C6**. We don't yet know which is at which position.\n    *   \"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\": The meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at C3 and C5. Since all three are meta to each other, this 1,3,5-arrangement is confirmed. So, **-CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5**. We don't yet know which is at which position.\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\": This is the key piece of information to resolve the ambiguities. The methoxy group is at C4.\n        *   Case 1: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since methoxy is at C4, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C2. This is a consistent arrangement.\n        *   Case 2: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since methoxy is at C4, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C6. This is also a consistent arrangement.\n\n    Let's write out the full structures for both cases:\n    *   **Structure from Case 1:** C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **Structure from Case 2:** C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH₃)₂), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CN), C6(-OH)\n\n4.  **Apply Numbering Rules (Lowest Locants):**\n    *   The numbering must start from C1 (-COOH). We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise. The goal is to give the set of substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   For both structures derived above, the substituents are on carbons 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` regardless of whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Tie-breaker rule:** When two numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, we choose the direction that assigns the lowest number to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize Substituents:**\n    *   **c**yano (-CN)\n    *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n    The correct alphabetical order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n\n6.  **Apply the Tie-breaker and Finalize the Name:**\n    Let's analyze the numbering for the unique structure we have determined.\n    *   The structure is: C1(-COOH), C4(-OCH₃), C2/C6 (-OH, -NMe₂), C3/C5 (-CN, -CHO), with the specific constraints from step 3.\n    *   Let's consider the structure from Case 1 above: C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **Numbering Direction 1 (Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n    *   **Numbering Direction 2 (Counter-clockwise):** The substituents would be at: C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n    *   The first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**.\n        *   In Direction 1, 'cyano' is at position **3**.\n        *   In Direction 2, 'cyano' is at position **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, we must use **Direction 1**.\n\n7.  **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    Using the numbering from Direction 1:\n    *   Parent: benzoic acid\n    *   Substituents with locants:\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Combine them alphabetically: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The generated name matches option B exactly.\n\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid: Incorrect numbering (violates the tie-breaker rule).\n    *   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid: **Correct.**\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid: Incorrect alphabetical order in the name.\n    *   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid: Incorrect alphabetical order in the name.\n\n<<<B>>>"
