These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the three reactions to determine the reactants and major final products.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(CO₂Me)₂. The α-protons between the two ester groups are acidic. The strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This attack forms a new C-C bond and creates a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) -CH⁻-CO₂Me`.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is `(MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-CO₂Me`.\n    *   To name this compound using IUPAC nomenclature, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups (the esters). This is a three-carbon propane chain with carboxylate groups at positions 1, 1, and 3. The p-tolyl group is at position 2.\n    *   The systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (which corresponds to the α-carbon of the parent ketone). The nucleophilic attack occurs from the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   The enamine's nucleophilic carbon (C2 of the ring) attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium ion on the ring and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   The carbanion is protonated (likely by MeOH).\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (a ketone).\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (B):**\n    *   The overall reaction adds the butanenitrile group to the α-carbon of cyclohexanone.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group.\n    *   To name this compound, we can treat it as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is the 4-carbon nitrile. The substituent at position 3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The systematic name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product after acidic hydrolysis, not the enol form.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This product consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system and a `-(CH₂)₂-C(=O)-CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) substituent attached at the C2 position.\n    *   **Known Reactant:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`. This is a classic Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Unknown Reactant (C):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where MVK is the acceptor. Therefore, reactant C must be the Michael donor.\n    *   The 3-oxobutyl group in the product is formed from MVK after the addition reaction. The nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (the `CH₂` group) of MVK.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` anion, which then attaches to the MVK fragment.\n    *   The starting material, C, must therefore be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The protons on the carbon between the two carbonyls (C2) are highly acidic and are easily removed by the base (KOH) to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nComparing this with the given options, option C matches all three results.\n\n<<<C>>>"
