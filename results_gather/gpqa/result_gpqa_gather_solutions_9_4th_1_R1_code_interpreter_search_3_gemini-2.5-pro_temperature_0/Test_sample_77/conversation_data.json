These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The solution involves recalling the standard formulas, performing a minor algebraic manipulation, and comparing them to the provided options.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concept**: The question asks for the electromagnetic potentials generated by a moving point charge. The fundamental principle governing this is **retardation**. Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`, the potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The problem's notation is set up to reflect this, with all source-related quantities ($\\vec{s}$, $\\vec{v}$, $\\vec{d}$) being evaluated at $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The standard textbook expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, derived from Maxwell's equations, are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    All quantities on the right-hand side are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Reformat the Expressions to Match the Options**: The options provided have a slightly different algebraic structure. We can obtain this form by manipulating the denominator of the standard expressions. By finding a common denominator of `c`, the denominator term becomes:\n    $d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential equations, the `c` from the denominator of the fraction moves to the numerator of the overall expression:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options**:\n    *   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: **Correct**. These expressions perfectly match the derived formulas for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n    *   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which neglects retardation. The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally and physically incorrect.\n    *   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: Incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to a non-physical \"advanced potential,\" which violates causality.\n    *   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is the static potential, which is wrong for a moving charge.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Retardation is Essential**: The potentials depend on the charge's properties (position and velocity) at the *retarded time* $t_r$, not the observation time $t$. Any formula based on the static potential (like in options B and D) is incorrect for a moving charge.\n*   **The Denominator is Key**: The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is the defining feature of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. It is not simply proportional to the distance `d` but includes a crucial correction factor that accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect of the moving source. The potential is strengthened if the charge moves toward the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$) and weakened if it moves away.\n*   **The Sign is Crucial**: The negative sign in the denominator is a direct result of the derivation and the physics of retardation for a causal field. A positive sign (as in option C) corresponds to an unphysical, non-causal \"advanced potential\" where the effect precedes the cause.\n*   **Consistency Check**: The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Using the identity $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o\\epsilon_o)$, one can verify that the expressions in option A satisfy this relationship, providing an additional check on their correctness.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: The provided answers from other agents show a strong consensus on the underlying physics. They all correctly derive the same mathematical formulas. The variation in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) indicates that the options were shuffled for each agent. The overwhelming agreement in the *reasoning* points to the formulas presented in option A of this specific question.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis task requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge.

We can obtain this form by multiplying the numerator and the denominator of the fraction inside the brackets by `c`:\n    *   The denominator term becomes: $c \\times (d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) = dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$.\n    *   Substituting this back into the potential formulas, the `c` term moves to the main numerator:\n        *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n        *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options**: Now we compare these correctly derived expressions with the choices provided:\n    *   **A) & B)** These options are incorrect because they use the static Coulomb potential, $V \\propto q/r$, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the crucial effect of retardation.\n    *   **C)** This option is incorrect due to the positive sign (`+`) in the denominator.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The solution involves recalling the standard formulas, performing a minor algebraic manipulation, and comparing them to the provided options.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concept**: The question asks for the electromagnetic potentials generated by a moving point charge. The fundamental principle governing this is **retardation**. Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`, the potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The problem's notation is set up to reflect this, with all source-related quantities ($\\vec{s}$, $\\vec{v}$, $\\vec{d}$) being evaluated at $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The standard textbook expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, derived from Maxwell's equations, are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    All quantities on the right-hand side are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Reformat the Expressions to Match the Options**: The options provided have a slightly different algebraic structure.
