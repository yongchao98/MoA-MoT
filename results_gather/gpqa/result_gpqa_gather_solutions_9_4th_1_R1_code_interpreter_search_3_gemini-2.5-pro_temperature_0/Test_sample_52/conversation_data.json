The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.\n\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\nThe most reliable method is to translate each piece of spectroscopic data into a corresponding molecular fragment and then assemble the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these four protons strongly implies a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4- (para). This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows two distinct –CH₃ signals but, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To avoid creating a –CH₂– group (as in an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula.\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl part)\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a powerful check for the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **DoU from Options (using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`):**\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6 (Possible)\n    *   D) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6 (Possible)\n\nThis check eliminates options A and B, leaving C and D.\n\n### Step 4: Final Elimination Using All Constraints\nWe must now distinguish between C₁₂H₁₄O₂ and C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n*   Our detailed fragment analysis in Step 2 unambiguously led to the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n*   The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ differs from C₁₁H₁₂O₂ by one carbon and two hydrogens, which is equivalent to an additional **-CH₂- group**.\n*   The problem statement explicitly says there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This critical piece of negative evidence definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This corresponds to option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Negative Evidence is Key:** The statement \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is the most critical piece of information. It is not just descriptive; it is a constraint that actively eliminates C₁₂H₁₄O₂, which otherwise has the correct Degree of Unsaturation.\n*   **Specific NMR Patterns:** Recognizing the \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region as a classic signature for a propenyl group is essential for correctly identifying the C₃H₅ fragment.\n*   **Systematic Approach:** Combining a detailed fragment analysis with a Degree of Unsaturation check provides a robust, two-pronged method for solving this type of problem.\n*   **Consensus in Reasoning:** All candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis and deduced the formula to be C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to inconsistent ordering of the options in their prompts, not flawed chemical logic. This provides very high confidence in the derived formula.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The final step must always be to carefully match the derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) to the specific list of options provided in the original question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments:** The most reliable method is to translate each piece of spectroscopic information into a corresponding molecular fragment and then assemble the molecule.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR shows only \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which, for the four protons on such a ring, strongly implies a symmetrical 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** and one C=O double bond.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n    *   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" but, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To avoid creating a -CH₂- group (as in an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the fragment must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, the atoms contributed by the ester carbonyl, the two oxygens, and the second methyl group sum to **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:** By combining the identified fragments, we can determine the total atom count:\n    *   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** This calculation serves as an excellent cross-check.\n    *   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   **DoU from Options (Formula: DoU = C + 1 - H/2):**\n        *   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n        *   B) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n        *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6 (Possible)\n        *   D) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6 (Possible)\n\n4.  **Final Elimination and Conclusion:** The DoU check narrows the possibilities to C₁₂H₁₄O₂ and C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The fragment analysis provides the deciding information.\n    *   Our detailed analysis constructed the molecule with the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   The alternative, C₁₂H₁₄O₂, contains one more carbon and two more hydrogens, which corresponds to an extra **-CH₂- group**.\n    *   The problem explicitly states there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups,\"** which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n    *   Therefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Unanimous Chemical Analysis:** All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis and deduced the molecular formula to be C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This provides extremely high confidence in the scientific reasoning.\n*   **The \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** This piece of negative evidence is the most critical clue. It is not just descriptive; it is a constraint that actively eliminates C₁₂H₁₄O₂, which otherwise has the correct Degree of Unsaturation.\n*   **Specific NMR Patterns:** Recognizing the \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" as a signature for a propenyl group is a key step that greatly simplifies the fragment analysis.\n*   **DoU as a Filter:** Using the Degree of Unsaturation is an efficient first step to quickly eliminate options that are fundamentally inconsistent with the structural information.\n*   **Mapping Errors:** The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers were due to them referencing different or scrambled lists of options. The chemical deduction itself was sound in all cases. The final step must always be to map the derived formula back to the original list of options.\n\nMatching the derived formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** to the original list of options:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically analyze the chemical information provided in the question to determine the molecular formula. I will follow the logical steps demonstrated in the candidate answers, which are scientifically sound.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct Spectroscopic Data**: I will break down the FTIR and ¹H NMR data into molecular fragments (aromatic ring, ester group, vinyl group, etc.).\n2.  **Assemble Fragments**: I will sum the atoms from these fragments to derive the complete molecular formula.\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**: I will calculate the DoU from the derived formula and compare it to the DoU expected from the structural features (ring, double bonds) to ensure consistency. This step also helps eliminate incorrect options.\n4.  **Analyze Candidate Answers and Identify Careful Points**: I will note the strong consensus in the chemical reasoning among the candidate answers and highlight the key pieces of evidence, especially the \"no -CH₂- groups\" constraint. I will also point out that the variation in final letter choices is due to inconsistent option labeling, not flawed analysis.\n5.  **Make the Final Decision**: I will match the correctly derived formula to the specific list of options provided in the original question to select the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data to determine a chemical formula, synthesizes reasoning\n    from multiple agents, and provides a final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The options as provided in the original question's prompt\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C12H12O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C12H14O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C11H12O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Deconstructing the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    # Fragment 1: Aromatic Ring\n    fragment_ring = {\"C\": 6, \"H\": 4}\n    print(f\"- A di-substituted aromatic ring with 2 proton signals implies a symmetrical C6H4 fragment.

In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula.\n\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl part)\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a powerful check for the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n\n*   **DoU from Structural Features:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **DoU from the Options (Formula: DoU = C + 1 - H/2):**\n    *   **A) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. (Matches)\n    *   **B) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   **C) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7.

It is not just descriptive; it is a constraint that allows for the elimination of C₁₂H₁₄O₂, which otherwise has the correct Degree of Unsaturation.\n*   **Specific NMR Patterns:** Recognizing the \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" as a classic signature for a propenyl group is essential for correctly identifying the C₃H₅ fragment and avoiding errors.\n*   **Systematic Analysis:** Combining fragment analysis with DoU verification provides a robust, two-pronged approach to solving the problem and confirming the result.\n*   **Mapping to Original Options:** The final, crucial step is to map the derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) back to the original list of options provided in the question to select the correct letter.\n\nMatching our derived formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** to the original options:\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C12H12O2\nD) C12H14O2\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information and candidate responses.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments:** The most reliable method, used consistently by all candidate answers, is to translate the spectroscopic data into molecular building blocks.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons.

The second methyl group must be part of the ester.

Having only two signals for these four protons strongly implies a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4- (para). This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows two distinct –CH₃ signals but, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To avoid creating a –CH₂– group (as in an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula.\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl part)\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a powerful check for the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **DoU from Options (using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`):**\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6 (Possible)\n    *   D) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6 (Possible)\n\nThis check eliminates options A and B, leaving C and D.\n\n### Step 4: Final Elimination Using All Constraints\nWe must now distinguish between C₁₂H₁₄O₂ and C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n*   Our detailed fragment analysis in Step 2 unambiguously led to the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n*   The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ differs from C₁₁H₁₂O₂ by one carbon and two hydrogens, which is equivalent to an additional **-CH₂- group**.\n*   The problem statement explicitly says there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This critical piece of negative evidence definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This corresponds to option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Negative Evidence is Key:** The statement \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is the most critical piece of information. It is not just descriptive; it is a constraint that actively eliminates C₁₂H₁₄O₂, which otherwise has the correct Degree of Unsaturation.\n*   **Specific NMR Patterns:** Recognizing the \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region as a classic signature for a propenyl group is essential for correctly identifying the C₃H₅ fragment.\n*   **Systematic Approach:** Combining a detailed fragment analysis with a Degree of Unsaturation check provides a robust, two-pronged method for solving this type of problem.\n*   **Consensus in Reasoning:** All candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis and deduced the formula to be C₁₁H₁₂O₂.

This provides very high confidence in the derived formula.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The final step must always be to carefully match the derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) to the specific list of options provided in the original question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments:** The most reliable method is to translate each piece of spectroscopic information into a corresponding molecular fragment and then assemble the molecule.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR shows only \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which, for the four protons on such a ring, strongly implies a symmetrical 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** and one C=O double bond.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n    *   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" but, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To avoid creating a -CH₂- group (as in an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the fragment must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, the atoms contributed by the ester carbonyl, the two oxygens, and the second methyl group sum to **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:** By combining the identified fragments, we can determine the total atom count:\n    *   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** This calculation serves as an excellent cross-check.\n    *   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   **DoU from Options (Formula: DoU = C + 1 - H/2):**\n        *   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n        *   B) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n        *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6 (Possible)\n        *   D) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6 (Possible)\n\n4.  **Final Elimination and Conclusion:** The DoU check narrows the possibilities to C₁₂H₁₄O₂ and C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The fragment analysis provides the deciding information.\n    *   Our detailed analysis constructed the molecule with the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   The alternative, C₁₂H₁₄O₂, contains one more carbon and two more hydrogens, which corresponds to an extra **-CH₂- group**.\n    *   The problem explicitly states there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups,\"** which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n    *   Therefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Unanimous Chemical Analysis:** All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis and deduced the molecular formula to be C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This provides extremely high confidence in the scientific reasoning.\n*   **The \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** This piece of negative evidence is the most critical clue. It is not just descriptive; it is a constraint that actively eliminates C₁₂H₁₄O₂, which otherwise has the correct Degree of Unsaturation.\n*   **Specific NMR Patterns:** Recognizing the \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" as a signature for a propenyl group is a key step that greatly simplifies the fragment analysis.\n*   **DoU as a Filter:** Using the Degree of Unsaturation is an efficient first step to quickly eliminate options that are fundamentally inconsistent with the structural information.\n*   **Mapping Errors:** The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers were due to them referencing different or scrambled lists of options. The chemical deduction itself was sound in all cases. The final step must always be to map the derived formula back to the original list of options.\n\nMatching the derived formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** to the original list of options:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically analyze the chemical information provided in the question to determine the molecular formula. I will follow the logical steps demonstrated in the candidate answers, which are scientifically sound.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct Spectroscopic Data**: I will break down the FTIR and ¹H NMR data into molecular fragments (aromatic ring, ester group, vinyl group, etc.).\n2.  **Assemble Fragments**: I will sum the atoms from these fragments to derive the complete molecular formula.\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**: I will calculate the DoU from the derived formula and compare it to the DoU expected from the structural features (ring, double bonds) to ensure consistency. This step also helps eliminate incorrect options.\n4.  **Analyze Candidate Answers and Identify Careful Points**: I will note the strong consensus in the chemical reasoning among the candidate answers and highlight the key pieces of evidence, especially the \"no -CH₂- groups\" constraint. I will also point out that the variation in final letter choices is due to inconsistent option labeling, not flawed analysis.\n5.  **Make the Final Decision**: I will match the correctly derived formula to the specific list of options provided in the original question to select the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data to determine a chemical formula, synthesizes reasoning\n    from multiple agents, and provides a final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The options as provided in the original question's prompt\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C12H12O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C12H14O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C11H12O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Deconstructing the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    # Fragment 1: Aromatic Ring\n    fragment_ring = {\"C\": 6, \"H\": 4}\n    print(f\"- A di-substituted aromatic ring with 2 proton signals implies a symmetrical C6H4 fragment.

This conclusion was unanimously reached by all candidate answers based on their chemical analysis.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a powerful check for the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   **DoU from Options (Formula: DoU = C + 1 - H/2):**\n        *   A) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n        *   B) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n        *   **C) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6 (Matches)**\n        *   D) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n    This check eliminates options B and D, leaving A and C as possibilities.\n\n4.  **Final Elimination and Conclusion:** We must now distinguish between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (Option C) and C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Option A).\n    *   Our detailed fragment analysis in Step 2 unambiguously led to the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ differs from C₁₁H₁₂O₂ by one carbon and two hydrogens, which is equivalent to an additional **-CH₂- group**.\n    *   The problem statement explicitly says there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This critical piece of negative evidence definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Consensus on Chemical Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis and deduced the formula to be C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This indicates very high confidence in the scientific reasoning.\n*   **The \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** This piece of negative evidence is the most critical clue. It is not just descriptive; it is a constraint that actively eliminates C₁₂H₁₄O₂, which otherwise has the correct Degree of Unsaturation.\n*   **Specific NMR Patterns:** Recognizing the \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" as a signature for a propenyl group is a key step that provides a specific C₃H₅ fragment, making the puzzle much easier to solve.\n*   **Mapping Errors in Candidate Answers:** The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers (A, B, C, D) are due to them referencing different or scrambled lists of options. The chemical deduction itself was sound in all cases. The final step must be to map the correct formula back to the specific list provided in the question.\n\nThe derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and the original question, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments**\n    All candidate answers correctly break down the spectroscopic data to identify the molecule's building blocks.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" implies a symmetrical C₆H₄ fragment.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms an ester group (-COO-), which accounts for the two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region are a classic and unambiguous signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n    *   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows two distinct -CH₃ signals. One is part of the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester. The crucial piece of information is that there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This means the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃), not an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). This fragment contributes C₂H₃O₂ to the overall formula.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula**\n    By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula.

The fragment analysis from Step 2 provides the deciding factor.\n    *   Our detailed analysis constructed the molecule with the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   The alternative, C₁₂H₁₄O₂, contains one more carbon and two more hydrogens, which corresponds to an extra -CH₂- group.\n    *   The problem explicitly states there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups,\"** which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n    *   Therefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Consensus on Chemical Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis and unanimously concluded that the molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.

This is a clerical error in their process, not a scientific one, as the chemical deduction itself was sound across all answers.\n*   **Final Answer Mapping:** The final step must be to carefully match the derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, to the specific list of options provided in this question.\n\nMatching the derived formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** to the provided options:\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C11H14O2\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, here is a step-by-step deduction of the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments:** The most reliable method, as shown by the consensus in the candidate answers, is to translate each piece of spectroscopic information into a corresponding molecular fragment.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" For a di-substituted ring with four protons, having only two signals strongly implies a symmetrical substitution pattern (likely 1,4-para). This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula and one C=O double bond.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**.

It is not just descriptive; it is a hard constraint that eliminates plausible-seeming alternatives (like C₁₂H₁₄O₂) that have the correct Degree of Unsaturation.\n*   **Specific NMR Splitting Patterns:** Recognizing that a \"doublet and a doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region is a classic signature for a propenyl group is essential for correctly identifying the C₃H₅ fragment and avoiding ambiguity.\n*   **Systematic Fragment Analysis:** The most robust method is to build the molecule from its constituent parts based on the data, rather than trying to fit the data to the pre-existing formulas. Summing the fragments (C₆H₄ + C₃H₅ + C₂H₃O₂) leads directly to the answer.\n*   **DoU as a Verification Tool:** Using the Degree of Unsaturation is an excellent method to quickly filter out impossible options and to cross-check the final derived formula, but it is often insufficient on its own to provide the final answer.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the chemical reasoning was unanimously correct in deriving C₁₁H₁₂O₂, errors can occur in the final step of matching the derived formula to the correct letter in the multiple-choice list.
