A compound is optically active if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and is not present as a 50:50 mixture of its enantiomers (a racemic mixture).

The chemical analysis consistently and correctly yields a count of 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the final answer, a careful, step-by-step analysis of each compound is required to ascertain its optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and is not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture. The presence of stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), etc., in a name signifies that a single stereoisomer is being considered, which will be optically active if the molecule itself is chiral.\n\nHere is the analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane of symmetry renders the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule is being described. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3) but is structurally symmetrical. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and the name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=CH-` vs. `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This molecule is highly symmetrical and possesses multiple planes of symmetry (for example, a plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group). The presence of a plane of symmetry makes it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of the structure `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center.

A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and is not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which means it lacks any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. When a name includes stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S), it implies a single, pure stereoisomer is being considered, which will be optically active if the molecule itself is chiral.\n\nAfter analyzing each compound, I will count the number of optically active ones and select the corresponding option from the list A, B, C, D.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene.

Meso compounds are achiral and optically inactive.\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks internal symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and the name specifies a single enantiomer, which is optically active.\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, and two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=CH-` vs. `-CH2-CH2-CH=`).

Understand the Core Concept**\nThe question asks for the number of compounds that will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if:\n*   It is **chiral**, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n*   It is not present as a **racemic mixture** (a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers), which is optically inactive due to external compensation.\n*   It is not a **meso compound**, which is an achiral compound that has stereocenters but is rendered achiral by an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\nWhen a compound's name includes specific stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), (3aR,7aS), etc., it implies that we are considering a single, pure stereoisomer. If this stereoisomer is chiral, it will be optically active.\n\n**2. Systematic Analysis of Each Compound**\nThe reasoning provided in the candidate answers is overwhelmingly consistent and correct.

A compound is optically active if it is chiral (its mirror image is non-superimposable) and is not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture. When a compound's name includes specific stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or others, it implies we are considering a single, pure stereoisomer, which will be optically active if the molecule itself is chiral.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as an internal plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This explicitly defines the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. This means we are dealing with a single, specific stereoisomer of a chiral molecule. A single enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure (`HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`). The `(2R,3S)` configuration in a symmetrical molecule with two chiral centers results in a **meso compound**. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral, despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal symmetry elements. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the `-CH2-CH=CH-` path around the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` path around the ring. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-`cis` isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This molecule is highly symmetrical and possesses multiple planes of symmetry (for example, a plane passing through any C-OH bond and the opposite CH₂ group). The presence of a plane of symmetry makes it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. An analysis of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\nMatching this count to the given options:\nA) 2\nB) 3\nC) 4\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer by evaluating the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Question**\nThe task is to determine how many of the seven listed chemical compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and is not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture.

Such a sample will be optically active unless the molecule is a meso compound (achiral despite having stereocenters).\n\n**2.

A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and is not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which requires the absence of any internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. When a name includes stereochemical descriptors such as (R) or (S), it signifies a single, pure stereoisomer, which will be optically active if the molecule itself is chiral.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane of the molecule acts as an internal plane of symmetry, rendering the molecule achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes the specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`.

A pure sample of a single enantiomer is, by definition, **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule possesses two chiral centers (C2 and C3) but has a symmetrical structure. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer, which is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=CH-` vs. `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, indicating a single, chiral molecule that is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This molecule is highly symmetrical and possesses multiple planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group). The presence of these symmetry planes makes the molecule achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of this molecule's structure, `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`, reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary of Optically Active Compounds:**\nBased on the analysis, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is 3.
