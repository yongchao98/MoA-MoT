It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The two-step process of treatment with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** A fundamental rule in stereochemistry is that an **anti-addition** to a **trans-alkene** yields a **meso compound**. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains stereocenters but is superimposable on its mirror image due to an internal element of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The same *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction is performed.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding stereochemical rule is that an **anti-addition** to a **cis-alkene** yields a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are critical for predicting the chromatography results:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Chromatographic Results**\n\nThis step requires understanding the principles of achiral and chiral chromatography.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity, size).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they **cannot be separated** by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The mixture will show **2 peaks**. One peak will be for the meso-diol, and the second peak will be for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) + (4S,5S)).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of molecules that are mirror images.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the two **enantiomers**, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a **diastereomer** of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** All three stereoisomers will be resolved, resulting in **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**. Matching this result to the given options:\n\nA) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning presented in the candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Starting Material and Reaction:** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. The reaction sequence of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) performs an *anti*-dihydroxylation, adding two hydroxyl (-OH) groups to opposite faces of the original double bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** A key principle in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition of a substituent to a *trans*-alkene results in the formation of a **meso compound**. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains stereocenters but is superimposable on its mirror image due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product:** Reaction 1 yields a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Starting Material and Reaction:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. It undergoes the same *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** The corresponding stereochemical rule is that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture**. A racemic mixture is a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror-image molecules).\n*   **Product:** Reaction 2 yields two products in equal amounts: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains a total of **three distinct stereoisomers**:\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are crucial for predicting the outcome of chromatography:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### **4. Prediction of the Chromatographic Results**\n\n*   **Standard (Achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated into distinct peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the meso-diol will form one peak, and the co-eluting enantiomeric pair will form a second peak.\n    *   **Total Peaks Observed: 2**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated as its own distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, all three unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   **Total Peaks Observed: 3**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to logically deduce the number of peaks observed in each type of HPLC by following the established principles of stereochemistry and chromatography.

The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are crucial for predicting the chromatography results:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Chromatographic Results**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   In the mixture, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   **Result:** **2 peaks** will be observed (one for the meso compound, and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers through transient diastereomeric interactions.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own peak.\n    *   **Result:** All three stereoisomers will be resolved, and **3 peaks** will be observed.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**.

It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The two-step process of treatment with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** A fundamental rule in stereochemistry is that an **anti-addition** to a **trans-alkene** yields a **meso compound**.

It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The same *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction is performed.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding stereochemical rule is that an **anti-addition** to a **cis-alkene** yields a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are critical for predicting the chromatography results:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Chromatographic Results**\n\nThis step requires understanding the principles of achiral and chiral chromatography.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity, size).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they **cannot be separated** by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The mixture will show **2 peaks**. One peak will be for the meso-diol, and the second peak will be for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) + (4S,5S)).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of molecules that are mirror images.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the two **enantiomers**, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a **diastereomer** of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** All three stereoisomers will be resolved, resulting in **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**.

The reaction sequence of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) performs an *anti*-dihydroxylation, adding two hydroxyl (-OH) groups to opposite faces of the original double bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** A key principle in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition of a substituent to a *trans*-alkene results in the formation of a **meso compound**. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains stereocenters but is superimposable on its mirror image due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product:** Reaction 1 yields a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Starting Material and Reaction:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. It undergoes the same *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** The corresponding stereochemical rule is that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture**. A racemic mixture is a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror-image molecules).\n*   **Product:** Reaction 2 yields two products in equal amounts: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains a total of **three distinct stereoisomers**:\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are crucial for predicting the outcome of chromatography:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### **4. Prediction of the Chromatographic Results**\n\n*   **Standard (Achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated into distinct peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the meso-diol will form one peak, and the co-eluting enantiomeric pair will form a second peak.\n    *   **Total Peaks Observed: 2**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated as its own distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, all three unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   **Total Peaks Observed: 3**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to logically deduce the number of peaks observed in each type of HPLC by following the established principles of stereochemistry and chromatography.

A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains stereocenters but has an internal plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Product 1:** A single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the products of Reaction 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene) undergoes the same *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** The *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl groups to a *cis*-alkene results in the formation of a **racemic mixture** (a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers).\n*   **Product 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture.**\n*   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains a total of **three unique stereoisomers**:\n    1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n*   **Relationships:** The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers** of each other. The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** to both of the other isomers.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the outcome on a standard (achiral) HPLC column.**\n*   **Principle:** Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Observation:** The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will elute together as a single peak. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer, will have different properties and will elute at a different time, forming a second peak.\n*   **Result:** **2 peaks** will be observed.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the outcome on a chiral HPLC column.**\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Observation:** The chiral column will resolve all three unique stereoisomers in the mixture. The meso-diol will have its own peak, and the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n*   **Result:** **3 peaks** will be observed.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the final mixture will produce **2 peaks on a standard HPLC column** and **3 peaks on a chiral HPLC column**.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the provided options:\nA) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consistent reasoning found across all candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Careful Points and Analysis**\n\n**Point 1: Identify the reaction and its stereochemical rules.**\n*   The reaction is a two-step process: 1) epoxidation with mCPBA, followed by 2) acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide with water. This sequence is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene. This means the two -OH groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond.\n*   The stereochemical outcome depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. The key rules are:\n    *   *Anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a **meso compound**.\n    *   *Anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a **racemic mixture** (a pair of enantiomers).\n\n**Point 2: Apply the rules to each specific reaction.**\n*   **Reaction 1:** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. Applying the rule, the *anti*-dihydroxylation produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is an achiral molecule with two stereocenters.\n*   **Reaction 2:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. Applying the rule, the *anti*-dihydroxylation produces a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Point 3: Characterize the final product mixture.**\n*   The chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains a total of **three** distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n*   It is crucial to understand the relationship between these isomers. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers** of each other. The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n**Point 4: Predict the outcome on a standard (achiral) HPLC column.**\n*   Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot** be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can** be separated.\n*   Therefore, the mixture will show **2 peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: The meso-diol.\n    *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Point 5: Predict the outcome on a chiral HPLC column.**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   A chiral column can separate all stereoisomers: diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Therefore, all three unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks. The mixture will show **3 peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: The meso-diol.\n    *   Peak 2: The (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   Peak 3: The (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**. Matching this result to the given options:\n\nA) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning found across all the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1.

They will elute from the column at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show two distinct peaks: one for the meso-diol, and a second, larger peak for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment inside the column. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer.\n    *   A chiral column can separate enantiomers into distinct peaks. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three unique stereoisomers in the mixture, each giving its own peak.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **4.
