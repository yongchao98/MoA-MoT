This analysis was performed correctly by all candidate agents.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broad peak is the O-H stretch, made extremely broad by strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   The **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. This provides unambiguous proof that corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion from Data Synthesis:** The combined evidence from all three techniques leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula**\n\nBased on the identified functional groups, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key constraints.\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The molecule contains one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the molecule **must have a total DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements**\n\nWe will now evaluate the four possible chemical formulas against these two requirements. The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **Formula C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Fails the oxygen requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Formula C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Fails the oxygen requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Formula C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (Passes)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. **Incorrect.** This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, leaving no room for the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n*   **Formula C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (Passes)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. **Correct.** This formula perfectly accommodates both a carboxylic acid (2 oxygens, 1 DoU) and an alkene (1 DoU).\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Map the Correct Formula to the Final Answer**\n\nThe final step is to map the correct chemical formula to the specific lettered options provided in the question.\n\nThe options are:\nA) C6H10O2\nB) C6H12O\nC) C6H12O2\nD) C6H10O\n\nOur analysis has definitively identified the correct formula as **C6H10O2**, which corresponds to option **A**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Corroboration of Evidence:** The conclusion is extremely strong because multiple, independent techniques confirm the presence of the key functional groups. The carboxylic acid is identified by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is identified by FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation as the Deciding Factor:** The DoU calculation is the critical quantitative step that definitively distinguishes between C6H10O2 and C6H12O2, the two options that have the correct number of oxygen atoms.\n3.  **Mapping Formula to the Option Letter:** This was the primary point of failure for the majority of the candidate answers. While nearly all agents correctly deduced the chemical formula was C6H10O2, they failed to map it to the correct letter (A) as presented in the question's option list. It is crucial to perform this final mapping step correctly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the evidence from each analytical technique to determine the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broad peak is the O-H stretch, made extremely broad by strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   A **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** provides direct, unambiguous confirmation of the **C=C double bond** suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This strongly corroborates the FTIR evidence.\n\n**Conclusion from Data Synthesis:** The combined evidence from all three techniques proves that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula**\n\nThe conclusion from Step 1 imposes two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds. The molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas**\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against these two requirements using the DoU formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (**Passes**).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2** (**Passes**). This formula is fully consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1 (**Fails**). Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1 (**Fails**). Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (**Passes**).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1** (**Fails**). This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated structure, which contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Corroboration of Evidence:** The conclusion is highly reliable because the key functional groups are confirmed by multiple, independent techniques. The carboxylic acid is supported by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is supported by FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n2.  **Oxygen Count as a Quick Filter:** The definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid immediately eliminates any formulas that do not contain exactly two oxygen atoms, narrowing the possibilities down from four to two.\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation as the Deciding Factor:** The DoU calculation is the critical quantitative step that definitively distinguishes between the two formulas containing two oxygen atoms (C6H10O2 and C6H12O2). Only C6H10O2 has the required two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n4.  **Mapping the Formula to the Correct Option:** The chemical analysis unambiguously points to the formula **C6H10O2**. The final step is to map this correct formula to the corresponding letter in the question's list. In the provided question, C6H10O2 is listed as option A.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first break down the spectroscopic data to determine the necessary characteristics of the unknown molecule. Then, I will write a Python script to systematically evaluate each of the given chemical formulas against these characteristics. The script will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) and check the oxygen count for each option, printing its reasoning for each step. Finally, based on the script's output, I will identify the single correct formula and map it to the corresponding choice from the original question.\n\nHere are the thinking steps:\n1.  **Analyze Spectroscopic Data**:\n    *   **FTIR**: A very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ plus a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is the classic signature of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   **¹H NMR**: The presence of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry**: A fragment at m/z = 45 corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ cation, which strongly confirms the carboxylic acid group.\n2.  **Establish Molecular Formula Constraints**:\n    *   From the confirmed carboxylic acid group, the molecule **must have 2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Each double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the total **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) must be 2**.\n3.  **Systematically Evaluate Options**:\n    *   The Python code will take each formula (C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2) and check it against the two constraints.\n    *   **Constraint 1 Check**: Does the formula have exactly 2 oxygen atoms?\n    *   **Constraint 2 Check**: Does the formula have a DoU of 2? (DoU = C + 1 - H/2).\n4.  **Identify Careful Points**: The analysis must highlight that the conclusion is strong due to corroborating evidence from multiple techniques. The most critical step is the DoU calculation, which distinguishes between the two formulas that have the correct oxygen count. A common error in the provided answers was incorrectly mapping the correct chemical formula to the given lettered options, so this step must be done carefully.\n5.  **Determine Final Answer**: The only formula that satisfies both constraints is the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function systematically analyzes spectroscopic data to identify the correct\n    chemical formula from a list of options.

The broad peak is the O-H stretch, made exceptionally broad by strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   The **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** is an explicit confirmation of the **C=C double bond**. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of an alkene, providing unambiguous evidence that corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion from Data Synthesis:** The combined evidence from all three techniques points to a single, unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula**\n\nThe conclusion from Step 1 imposes two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula, which we can use to evaluate the options.\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is certain. This functional group contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is a quantitative check that represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds. The identified functional groups tell us the required DoU:\n    *   One degree of unsaturation for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid.\n    *   One degree of unsaturation for the C=C double bond of the alkene.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements**\n\nWe will now evaluate the options provided in the question against these two requirements. The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (Passes)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. **Incorrect.** This DoU is insufficient.

(Passes)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. **Correct.** This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This formula is fully consistent with all pieces of spectroscopic evidence.\n\n*   **C) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **D) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Corroboration of Evidence:** The conclusion is very strong because multiple, independent techniques confirm the presence of the key functional groups. The carboxylic acid is identified by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is identified by FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n2.  **Specificity of Data:** The description of the 3000 cm⁻¹ peak as \"very broad\" is crucial for identifying it as part of a carboxylic acid rather than a less broad alcohol peak. The m/z = 45 fragment is also highly specific.\n3.  **The Decisive Role of DoU:** The Degree of Unsaturation is the critical quantitative calculation. After using the oxygen count to eliminate two options, the DoU calculation definitively distinguishes between the remaining two candidates (C6H10O2 and C6H12O2).\n4.  **Correct Mapping of Formula to Option:** The analysis has definitively identified the correct formula as C6H10O2. It is crucial to map this back to the original list provided in the question, where C6H10O2 is listed as option B. Several candidate answers failed at this final mapping step.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided evidence is **C6H10O2**.

The carboxylic acid is confirmed by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is confirmed by FTIR and ¹H NMR. This cross-validation makes the identification of the functional groups very certain.\n2.  **Oxygen Count as a Quick Filter:** The definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid immediately establishes that the molecule must contain exactly two oxygen atoms. This allows for the rapid elimination of options A and D.\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation as the Deciding Factor:** The DoU calculation is the critical quantitative step that definitively distinguishes between the two remaining options, C6H12O2 (DoU=1, a saturated acid) and C6H10O2 (DoU=2, an unsaturated acid). The clear evidence for an alkene (C=C bond) makes a DoU of 2 a strict requirement.\n4.  **Correct Mapping of Formula to Option Letter:** A crucial final step, where many candidate answers failed, is to accurately map the correct chemical formula (C6H10O2) back to the corresponding lettered option provided in the question.

This conclusion imposes two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The molecule must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which means its formula must contain exactly **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The molecule must contain both a C=O double bond (from the acid) and a C=C double bond (from the alkene). Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements**\n\nWe now systematically evaluate the four given options based on these two requirements.

The only formula that has the required two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation is C6H10O2. Based on the provided options, C6H10O2 is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the evidence from each analytical technique to determine the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broad peak is the O-H stretch, made extremely broad by strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** provides unambiguous confirmation of the **C=C double bond**. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of an alkene, which corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion from Data Synthesis:** The combined evidence from all three techniques points to a single, unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula**\n\nBased on the identified functional groups, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key constraints:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds. The molecule has one C=O double bond (one degree of unsaturation) and one C=C double bond (a second degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements**\n\nWe will now evaluate the options provided in the question against these two requirements. The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Fails the oxygen requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Fails the oxygen requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. **Correct.**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. **Correct.** This formula perfectly accommodates both a carboxylic acid (2 oxygens, 1 DoU) and an alkene (1 DoU).\n\n*   **C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. **Correct.**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. **Incorrect.** This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond of the acid, not the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Corroboration of Evidence:** The conclusion is highly reliable because the key functional groups are confirmed by multiple, independent techniques. The carboxylic acid is confirmed by FTIR and Mass Spec, while the alkene is confirmed by FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n2.  **The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is Decisive:** The DoU calculation is the critical quantitative step. While both C6H10O2 and C6H12O2 have the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid, only C6H10O2 has the required two degrees of unsaturation to also include the C=C double bond.\n3.  **Mapping the Formula to the Correct Option:** The analysis consistently and unambiguously identifies the correct formula as **C6H10O2**. It is crucial to map this formula back to the original list provided in the question. Assuming a standard A, B, C, D ordering for the list (C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2), the correct formula corresponds to option C. The inconsistencies in the candidate answers highlight the importance of this final mapping step.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to have both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups\n\nThe first step is to interpret the evidence from each analytical technique to determine the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum**: The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.

It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion from Data Synthesis**: The combined evidence from all three techniques points to a single, unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula\n\nBased on the identified functional groups, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key constraints:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count**: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**: The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds.

It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This strongly corroborates the FTIR evidence.\n\n### **Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence and Establish Requirements for the Formula**\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques proves that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This conclusion imposes two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds. The molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene), so it must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas**\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against these two requirements using the DoU formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** Fails.

The carboxylic acid is supported by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is supported by FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n2.  **Oxygen Count as an Initial Filter:** The definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid immediately establishes that the molecule must contain exactly two oxygen atoms, allowing for the quick elimination of options A and C.\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation as the Decisive Calculation:** The DoU calculation is the critical quantitative step that definitively distinguishes between the two formulas containing two oxygen atoms. Only C6H10O2 has the required DoU of 2 to account for both the C=O and C=C bonds.\n4.  **Correct Mapping of Formula to Option Letter:** After the analysis unambiguously identifies the correct formula as C6H10O2, it is essential to map it back to the specific lettered option provided in the question. In this case, C6H10O2 corresponds to option D.\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, while C6H10O2 has the required DoU of 2.\n4.  **Correct Mapping of Formula to Option Letter:** This is the most crucial final step and the source of all the confusion among the candidate answers.

Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the molecule **must have a total DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements**\n\nWe will now evaluate the four possible chemical formulas against these two requirements.

It is crucial to perform this final mapping step correctly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the evidence from each analytical technique to determine the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.

The carboxylic acid is supported by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is supported by FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n2.  **Oxygen Count as a Quick Filter:** The definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid immediately eliminates any formulas that do not contain exactly two oxygen atoms, narrowing the possibilities down from four to two.\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation as the Deciding Factor:** The DoU calculation is the critical quantitative step that definitively distinguishes between the two formulas containing two oxygen atoms (C6H10O2 and C6H12O2). Only C6H10O2 has the required two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n4.  **Mapping the Formula to the Correct Option:** The chemical analysis unambiguously points to the formula **C6H10O2**. The final step is to map this correct formula to the corresponding letter in the question's list.

Then, I will write a Python script to systematically evaluate each of the given chemical formulas against these characteristics. The script will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) and check the oxygen count for each option, printing its reasoning for each step. Finally, based on the script's output, I will identify the single correct formula and map it to the corresponding choice from the original question.\n\nHere are the thinking steps:\n1.  **Analyze Spectroscopic Data**:\n    *   **FTIR**: A very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ plus a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is the classic signature of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   **¹H NMR**: The presence of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry**: A fragment at m/z = 45 corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ cation, which strongly confirms the carboxylic acid group.\n2.  **Establish Molecular Formula Constraints**:\n    *   From the confirmed carboxylic acid group, the molecule **must have 2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Each double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the total **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) must be 2**.\n3.  **Systematically Evaluate Options**:\n    *   The Python code will take each formula (C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2) and check it against the two constraints.\n    *   **Constraint 1 Check**: Does the formula have exactly 2 oxygen atoms?\n    *   **Constraint 2 Check**: Does the formula have a DoU of 2? (DoU = C + 1 - H/2).\n4.  **Identify Careful Points**: The analysis must highlight that the conclusion is strong due to corroborating evidence from multiple techniques. The most critical step is the DoU calculation, which distinguishes between the two formulas that have the correct oxygen count.

The code execution confirms that only the formula **C6H10O2** meets both of these criteria. According to the provided list of options, C6H10O2 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the evidence from each analytical technique to determine the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.

This strongly corroborates the FTIR evidence.\n\n**Conclusion from Data Synthesis:** The combined evidence from all three techniques proves that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula**\n\nThe conclusion from Step 1 imposes two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds. The molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas**\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against these two requirements.

This functional group contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is a quantitative check that represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds. The identified functional groups tell us the required DoU:\n    *   One degree of unsaturation for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid.\n    *   One degree of unsaturation for the C=C double bond of the alkene.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements**\n\nWe will now evaluate the options provided in the question against these two requirements.

The carboxylic acid is identified by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is identified by FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n2.  **Specificity of Data:** The description of the 3000 cm⁻¹ peak as \"very broad\" is crucial for identifying it as part of a carboxylic acid rather than a less broad alcohol peak. The m/z = 45 fragment is also highly specific.\n3.  **The Decisive Role of DoU:** The Degree of Unsaturation is the critical quantitative calculation. After using the oxygen count to eliminate two options, the DoU calculation definitively distinguishes between the remaining two candidates (C6H10O2 and C6H12O2).\n4.  **Correct Mapping of Formula to Option:** The analysis has definitively identified the correct formula as C6H10O2.

(Passes)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. **Correct.** This formula perfectly accommodates both a carboxylic acid (2 oxygens, 1 DoU) and an alkene (1 DoU).\n\n*   **D) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Corroboration of Evidence:** The conclusion is highly reliable because the evidence is corroborative. The carboxylic acid is confirmed by FTIR and Mass Spec, while the alkene is confirmed by FTIR and ¹H NMR. This strong, multi-faceted evidence is the foundation of the correct answer.\n2.  **The Decisive Role of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** After using the oxygen count to eliminate options A and D, the DoU calculation is the critical quantitative step. It definitively distinguishes between C6H12O2 (a saturated carboxylic acid, DoU=1) and C6H10O2 (an unsaturated carboxylic acid, DoU=2). The evidence clearly points to the latter.\n3.  **Correct Mapping to Options:** The chemical analysis unanimously identifies **C6H10O2** as the correct formula. The final, crucial step is to map this formula back to the lettered options provided in the original question. In the original question's list, C6H10O2 corresponds to option C.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to have both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data and candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the evidence from each analytical technique to determine the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broad peak is the O-H stretch, made exceptionally broad by strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   A **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** provides direct, unambiguous confirmation of the **C=C double bond** suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This strongly corroborates the FTIR evidence.\n\n**Conclusion from Data Synthesis:** The combined evidence from all three techniques proves that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula**\n\nThe conclusion from Step 1 imposes two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds. The molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements**\n\nWe now evaluate the given options against these two requirements. The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **C6H12O:** Fails. Contains only one oxygen atom.\n*   **C6H10O:** Fails. Contains only one oxygen atom.\n*   **C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (Passes).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. Fails. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated structure, which contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond.\n*   **C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (Passes).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. Passes. This formula is fully consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid containing one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Corroboration of Evidence:** The conclusion is highly reliable because the key functional groups are confirmed by multiple, independent techniques. The carboxylic acid is supported by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is supported by FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n2.  **The Decisive Role of DoU:** The Degree of Unsaturation calculation is the critical quantitative step that definitively distinguishes between C6H12O2 (a saturated carboxylic acid) and C6H10O2 (an unsaturated carboxylic acid), both of which have the correct number of oxygen atoms.\n3.  **Correct Mapping of Formula to Option:** This is the most critical step where many candidate answers failed. The analysis has definitively identified the correct formula as **C6H10O2**. We must map this back to the original list of options provided in the question:\n    *   A) C6H12O2\n    *   B) C6H12O\n    *   C) C6H10O\n    *   D) C6H10O2\n\n    As shown in the list, the correct formula **C6H10O2** corresponds to option **D**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data conclusively shows the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only formula that has the required two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation is C6H10O2. Based on the provided options, C6H10O2 is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the evidence from each analytical technique to determine the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broad peak is the O-H stretch, made extremely broad by strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** provides unambiguous confirmation of the **C=C double bond**. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of an alkene, which corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion from Data Synthesis:** The combined evidence from all three techniques points to a single, unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula**\n\nBased on the identified functional groups, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key constraints:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds. The molecule has one C=O double bond (one degree of unsaturation) and one C=C double bond (a second degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements**\n\nWe will now evaluate the options provided in the question against these two requirements. The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Fails the oxygen requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Fails the oxygen requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. **Correct.**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. **Correct.** This formula perfectly accommodates both a carboxylic acid (2 oxygens, 1 DoU) and an alkene (1 DoU).\n\n*   **C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. **Correct.**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. **Incorrect.** This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond of the acid, not the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Corroboration of Evidence:** The conclusion is highly reliable because the key functional groups are confirmed by multiple, independent techniques. The carboxylic acid is confirmed by FTIR and Mass Spec, while the alkene is confirmed by FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n2.  **The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is Decisive:** The DoU calculation is the critical quantitative step. While both C6H10O2 and C6H12O2 have the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid, only C6H10O2 has the required two degrees of unsaturation to also include the C=C double bond.\n3.  **Mapping the Formula to the Correct Option:** The analysis consistently and unambiguously identifies the correct formula as **C6H10O2**. It is crucial to map this formula back to the original list provided in the question. Assuming a standard A, B, C, D ordering for the list (C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2), the correct formula corresponds to option C. The inconsistencies in the candidate answers highlight the importance of this final mapping step.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**.
