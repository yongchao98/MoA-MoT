It has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 is (R).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group, leaving the endocyclic double bond intact.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** This is a critical stereochemistry-determining step. The existing stereocenter at C4, bearing a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent attacks from the face of the ring *opposite* to the isopropyl group (*anti*-attack). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  In the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing up).\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash (pointing down).\n    3.  This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    4.  Assigning the absolute configuration using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to the new stereocenters gives **(1S, 2R, 4R)** for the major epoxide isomer.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** The major epoxide isomer, (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane (Product 2).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity & Stereochemistry):** Under basic conditions, the reaction is an Sₙ2 nucleophilic ring-opening.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** The major alcohol isomer, (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol (Product 3).\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. It occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the existing chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which exists as a mixture. The analysis of the major reaction pathway provides the most likely isomer to be present. The derived major product is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would result from an incorrect analysis of the epoxide opening step (e.g., retention of configuration or attack at the wrong carbon).\n*   C) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.\n*   D) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final answer. The key to solving this problem is to correctly identify the selectivity and stereochemical outcome of each reaction.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction Steps**\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 is in the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with one equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** This is a critical stereochemistry-determining step.

To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent attacks from the face of the ring *opposite* to the bulky isopropyl group. This is known as an *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  With the isopropyl group at C4 in the (R) configuration (visualized as \"up\" on a wedge), the *anti*-attack by m-CPBA occurs from the \"down\" face.\n    2.  The resulting epoxide oxygen will be on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    3.  Assigning the absolute configuration using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to the new stereocenters gives **(1S, 2R, 4R)** for the major epoxide isomer.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** The major epoxide isomer, (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane (Product 2).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity & Stereochemistry):** Under basic conditions, the reaction is an Sₙ2 nucleophilic ring-opening.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.

Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** The major alcohol isomer, (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol (Product 3).\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).

The derived major product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering.\n*   C) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.\n*   D) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2, which would result from an incorrect analysis of the epoxide opening step (e.g., retention of configuration instead of inversion).\n\nTherefore, the correct structure is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to meticulously analyze the four-step chemical reaction, paying close attention to selectivity and stereochemistry at each stage. I will determine the structure of the major product resulting from this sequence. The key points will be the selective hydrogenation, the diastereoselective epoxidation directed by the existing stereocenter, the regio- and stereoselective opening of the epoxide under basic conditions, and the final esterification. After deriving the full IUPAC name of the final product, I will compare it against the provided options to identify the correct choice.

The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The intermediate is (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n2. Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation. The alkene from Step 1 is treated with m-CPBA. The existing bulky isopropyl group at C4 directs the epoxidation to the opposite face of the ring (anti-attack) to minimize steric hindrance. This results in the formation of a major epoxide diastereomer with the configuration (1S, 2R, 4R). The major epoxide is (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n3. Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening. The epoxide is treated with sodium methoxide, a strong nucleophile. Under these basic (S_N2) conditions, the methoxide attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide, which is C2. This attack occurs with inversion of configuration, changing the stereocenter at C2 from (R) to (S). The resulting alcohol is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n4.

Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is converted to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected.

The existing stereocenter at C4 has a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA reagent will attack the double bond from the face *opposite* to this bulky group. This is known as an *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    1.  In the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group at C4 is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing \"up\").\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the m-CPBA approaches from the bottom face, placing the new epoxide oxygen on a dash (pointing \"down\").\n    3.  This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges (\"up\").\n    4.  Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the new stereocenters gives the major epoxide isomer (Product 2) the absolute configuration **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the epoxide opening is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side. The configuration at C2, which was (R) in the epoxide, is inverted to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).

An exocyclic (in the side chain), disubstituted double bond.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with one equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group, while the endocyclic double bond remains. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** The structure is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n### **Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), which forms an epoxide across the remaining double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a crucial stereochemistry-determining step.

The key to solving this problem is to correctly identify the outcome of each reaction, paying close attention to regioselectivity and stereochemistry.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction Steps**\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at carbon C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group, while the endocyclic double bond remains.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), which forms an epoxide across the double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** This is a critical stereochemistry-determining step. The existing stereocenter at C4 has a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA reagent will attack the double bond from the face of the ring *opposite* to this bulky group. This is known as an *anti*-attack and it forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemical Assignment of Product 2:**\n    1.  In the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is on a wedge (pointing \"up\").\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash (pointing \"down\").\n    3.  This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges (\"up\").\n    4.  Assigning the absolute configuration (R/S) to the new stereocenters gives the major epoxide isomer the configuration **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a source of the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the epoxide opening is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 remains (S).\n*   **Product 3:** The major alcohol isomer formed is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final major product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe final structure for the major isomer of product 4 is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - This is an incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   B) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.\n*   C) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This has incorrect stereochemistry at C2, which would result from an incorrect analysis of the epoxide opening step (i.e., retention of configuration instead of inversion).\n*   D) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This has incorrect numbering for the substituents on the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe correct answer is the one that matches the structure of the major product formed through the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final structure of product 4, with careful attention to points of selectivity and stereochemistry.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction Steps**\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted double bond within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 has an (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation using 1 equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is selective. It reduces the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond more rapidly. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond is reduced to a single bond, converting the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The major product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** This is a critical stereochemistry-determining step.

This is known as an *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemical Assignment of Product 2:**\n    1.  For the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is on a wedge (pointing \"up\").\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the m-CPBA approaches from the bottom face, placing the new epoxide oxygen on a dash (pointing \"down\").\n    3.  This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    4.  Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the new stereocenters (C1 and C2) gives the major epoxide isomer the absolute configuration **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the epoxide opening is an Sₙ2 reaction.

Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 remains (S).\n*   **Product 3:** The major alcohol isomer formed is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbons. Therefore, the stereochemistry of all chiral centers is retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final major product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe final structure for the major isomer of Product 4 is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - This is an incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This has incorrect numbering; the isopropyl group is at C4, not C5.\n*   C) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This has incorrect stereochemistry at C2.

Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group, while the endocyclic double bond remains.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** This is a critical stereochemistry-determining step. The existing stereocenter at C4 bears a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA reagent will attack the double bond from the face of the ring *opposite* to this bulky group. This is known as an *anti*-attack and it forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  In the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is on a wedge (pointing \"up\").\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash (pointing \"down\").\n    3.  This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    4.  Assigning the absolute configuration using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to the two new stereocenters gives the major epoxide isomer the configuration **(1S, 2R, 4R)**. (Note: While the assignment can be tricky, this is the accepted configuration for the major product of this reaction).\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** The major epoxide isomer, (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane (Product 2).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity & Stereochemistry):** Under basic conditions, the reaction is an Sₙ2 nucleophilic ring-opening.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** The major alcohol isomer, (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol (Product 3).\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. It occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the existing chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the major reaction pathway leads to the final structure **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**. Comparing this IUPAC name to the provided options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering; the isopropyl group is at C4.\n*   B) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.**\n*   C) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This has incorrect stereochemistry at C2.

It has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 is (R).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group, leaving the endocyclic double bond intact.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected.

The existing stereocenter at C4, bearing a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent attacks from the face of the ring *opposite* to the isopropyl group (*anti*-attack). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  In the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing up).\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash (pointing down).\n    3.  This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    4.

C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.

The stereocenter at C4 is in the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with one equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** This is a critical stereochemistry-determining step. The existing stereocenter at C4, bearing a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent attacks from the face of the ring *opposite* to the bulky isopropyl group. This is known as an *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  With the isopropyl group at C4 in the (R) configuration (visualized as \"up\" on a wedge), the *anti*-attack by m-CPBA occurs from the \"down\" face.\n    2.  The resulting epoxide oxygen will be on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    3.  Assigning the absolute configuration using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to the new stereocenters gives **(1S, 2R, 4R)** for the major epoxide isomer.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** The major epoxide isomer, (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane (Product 2).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity & Stereochemistry):** Under basic conditions, the reaction is an Sₙ2 nucleophilic ring-opening.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** The major alcohol isomer, (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol (Product 3).\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. It occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the existing chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the major reaction pathway provides the most likely isomer to be present in the final product mixture. The derived major product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering.\n*   C) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.\n*   D) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2, which would result from an incorrect analysis of the epoxide opening step (e.g., retention of configuration instead of inversion).\n\nTherefore, the correct structure is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to meticulously analyze the four-step chemical reaction, paying close attention to selectivity and stereochemistry at each stage. I will determine the structure of the major product resulting from this sequence. The key points will be the selective hydrogenation, the diastereoselective epoxidation directed by the existing stereocenter, the regio- and stereoselective opening of the epoxide under basic conditions, and the final esterification. After deriving the full IUPAC name of the final product, I will compare it against the provided options to identify the correct choice.

The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The intermediate is (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n2. Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation. The alkene from Step 1 is treated with m-CPBA. The existing bulky isopropyl group at C4 directs the epoxidation to the opposite face of the ring (anti-attack) to minimize steric hindrance. This results in the formation of a major epoxide diastereomer with the configuration (1S, 2R, 4R). The major epoxide is (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n3. Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening. The epoxide is treated with sodium methoxide, a strong nucleophile.

This attack occurs with inversion of configuration, changing the stereocenter at C2 from (R) to (S). The resulting alcohol is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n4.

In the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group at C4 is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing \"up\").\n    2.

The major product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** This is a critical stereochemistry-determining step. The existing stereocenter at C4, which has a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent attacks from the face of the ring *opposite* to the bulky isopropyl group. This is known as an *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemical Assignment of Product 2:**\n    1.  For the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is on a wedge (pointing \"up\").\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the m-CPBA approaches from the bottom face, placing the new epoxide oxygen on a dash (pointing \"down\").\n    3.  This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    4.  Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the new stereocenters (C1 and C2) gives the major epoxide isomer the absolute configuration **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the epoxide opening is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. Carbon C1 is tertiary, while carbon C2 is secondary. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 remains (S).\n*   **Product 3:** The major alcohol isomer formed is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbons. Therefore, the stereochemistry of all chiral centers is retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final major product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe final structure for the major isomer of Product 4 is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - This is an incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This has incorrect numbering; the isopropyl group is at C4, not C5.\n*   C) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This has incorrect stereochemistry at C2.

The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which exists as a mixture. The structure derived from the major reaction pathway is a valid component of this mixture. Our analysis shows the major product is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\nComparing this to the options provided:\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would be the product if the epoxide opening happened with retention of configuration.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and structure.\n*   C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   D) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final answer. The key to solving this problem is to correctly identify the selectivity and stereochemical outcome of each reaction.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction Steps**\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at carbon C4 is (R).\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** The existing stereocenter at C4, which has a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA reagent. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent attacks from the face of the ring *opposite* to the bulky isopropyl group. This is known as an *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    1.  With the (R) configuration at C4, the isopropyl group is on a wedge (pointing up).\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash (pointing down).\n    3.  This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    4.  Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the new stereocenters reveals the major epoxide isomer (Product 2) to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** The (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide (Product 2).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe) provides the strong nucleophile, methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions (Sₙ2 mechanism), the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 remains (S).\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** The (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol (Product 3).\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final major product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe detailed analysis of the major reaction pathway leads to the final structure **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   **A) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate:** This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.\n*   **B) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate:** This has incorrect stereochemistry at C2. It would be the product if the epoxide opening occurred with retention of configuration, which is mechanistically incorrect for an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate:** This is an incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   **D) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate:** This has incorrect numbering for the substituents on the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure of product 4. The key to solving this problem is to correctly determine the outcome of each reaction, paying close attention to selectivity and stereochemistry.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction Steps**\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at carbon C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group, while the endocyclic double bond remains.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** This is a critical stereochemistry-determining step. The existing stereocenter at C4 bears a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA reagent will attack the double bond from the face of the ring *opposite* to this bulky group. This is known as an *anti*-attack and it forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  In the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is on a wedge (pointing up).\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash (pointing down).\n    3.  This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    4.  Assigning the absolute configuration using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to the two new stereocenters gives the major epoxide isomer the configuration **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** The major epoxide isomer, (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane (Product 2).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity & Stereochemistry):** Under basic conditions, the reaction is an Sₙ2 nucleophilic ring-opening.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** The major alcohol isomer, (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol (Product 3).\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. It occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the existing chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the major reaction pathway leads to the final structure **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**. Comparing this IUPAC name to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.\n*   **B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This has incorrect numbering; the isopropyl group is at C4.\n*   **C) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This has incorrect stereochemistry at C2. It would be the product if the epoxide opening occurred with retention of configuration, which is mechanistically incorrect.\n*   **D) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate** - This is an incorrect constitutional isomer.\n\nThe correct answer is the structure corresponding to the major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction Steps and Careful Points**\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Reaction:** (R)-(+)-Limonene is treated with one equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the isopropenyl side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 is (R).\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond is selectively reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is converted to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** This is a critical stereochemistry-determining step. The existing stereocenter at C4 has a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA reagent attacks the double bond from the face of the ring *opposite* to this bulky group. This is known as an *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** Assuming the (R)-isopropyl group is on a wedge (pointing up), the *anti*-attack places the epoxide oxygen on a dash (pointing down). This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges. Applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to the two new stereocenters gives the major epoxide isomer the configuration **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a source of the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the epoxide opening is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon atom. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 (S) and C4 (R) are unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The major alcohol isomer formed is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (a Steglich esterification).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the tertiary alcohol at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbon centers. Therefore, the stereochemistry is fully retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final major product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe final structure for the major isomer of product 4 is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   **A) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate:** This perfectly matches the derived structure.\n*   **B) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate:** This has the incorrect stereochemistry at C2.
