    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number of atoms and bonds. The chemical formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's break it down and count the atoms:\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: This part has 1 central carbon atom, plus 2 methyl (CH3) groups. Total: 3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens.\n*   `=CH-`: 1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 Carbon in the chain, 1 Hydrogen, plus 1 methyl (CH3) group. Total: 2 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens.\n*   `-CH=`: 1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 central carbon atom, plus 2 methyl (CH3) groups. Total: 3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   Total Carbon (C) atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   Total Hydrogen (H) atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNow, let's count the bonds based on the structure:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** We can see two double bonds in the structure: `C=C` and `C=C`. So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can count them from the structure's skeleton and the methyl group attachments.\n    *   Bonds in the main chain: `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`. There are 4 single bonds here.\n    *   Bonds to methyl groups: The first `(CH3)2C` has 2 C-C bonds. The `-CH(CH3)-` has 1 C-C bond. The last `C(CH3)2` has 2 C-C bonds. Total from methyl groups = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.\n    *   Total C-C single bonds = 4 + 5 = **9**.\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   22 C-H bonds\n*   9 C-C bonds\n*   2 C=C bonds\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom_compound)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. It's the sum of all bond energies.\nΔH_atom_compound = (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C))\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom_compound = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nΔH_atom_compound = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements (ΣΔH_atom_elements)**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms (12 moles of C and 22 moles of H) from the elements in their standard states (C(graphite) and H2(g)).\n*   For 12 moles of Carbon:\n    Energy = 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = **12000 kJ**\n*   For 22 moles of Hydrogen:\n    We start from H2(g). The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol, which is the energy to form 2 moles of H(g).\n    So, the enthalpy of atomization for hydrogen is ΔH_atom(H) = BE(H-H) / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50 kJ/mol of H atoms.\n    Energy = 22 mol × ΔH_atom(H) = 22 mol × 50 kJ/mol = **1100 kJ**\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of elements:\nΣΔH_atom_elements = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to form gaseous atoms from elements and the energy released when these atoms form the compound.\nΔH_f = ΣΔH_atom_elements - ΔH_atom_compound\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert to the Units in the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur value in kJ/mol (1900) does not match option C. Option D is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not the enthalpy of formation. Option A has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Let's convert our answer to kJ/g to check option B.\n\n*   Calculate the molar mass of C12H22:\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n*   Convert ΔH_f to kJ/g:\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_H_H = 100  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C = 200  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C_double = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_H = 400  # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula: C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of bonds\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9\nnum_C_C_double_bonds = 2\n\n# 1.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Count Atoms**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the molecular formula from the given chemical structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's break down the structure and count the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: This part has 1 carbon in the main chain and 2 methyl (CH3) groups. Total: 1 + 2 = 3 Carbon atoms and 2 * 3 = 6 Hydrogen atoms.\n*   `=CH-`: 1 Carbon atom and 1 Hydrogen atom.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 Carbon atom and 2 Hydrogen atoms.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 Carbon atom in the chain, 1 Hydrogen atom, and 1 methyl (CH3) group.

Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of covalent bond in the molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds (`=`). So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We count the single bonds connecting the carbon atoms.\n    *   Bonds within the main chain: C-C=C-C-C-C-C=C-C. There are 4 single bonds connecting the carbons of the main chain.\n    *   Bonds connecting methyl groups to the chain: The first `(CH3)2C` has 2 C-C bonds. The `-CH(CH3)-` has 1 C-C bond.

Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using the following relationship involving bond energies and enthalpies of atomization:\nΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of products)]\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n*   **Step 3a: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the reactants.**\n    This is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states to gaseous atoms.\n    *   For 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 × 1000 kJ = 12000 kJ\n    *   For 22 moles of Hydrogen (from 11 moles of H2): 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 × 100 kJ = 1100 kJ\n    *   Total enthalpy of atomization = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n*   **Step 3b: Calculate the total bond energy of the product.**\n    This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule, which is also known as its enthalpy of atomization.\n    *   Energy from C-H bonds: 22 × BE(C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ = 8800 kJ\n    *   Energy from C-C bonds: 9 × BE(C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ = 1800 kJ\n    *   Energy from C=C bonds: 2 × BE(C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ = 600 kJ\n    *   Total bond energy = 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n*   **Step 3c: Calculate the enthalpy of formation.**\n    ΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)\n    ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**4.

Now we check the given options.\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value in kJ/mol (1900) does not match option C. Option D is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its enthalpy of formation. Option A has the correct number but incorrect units. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check option B.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    Molar Mass = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n\n*   **Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g:**\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_H_H = 100  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C = 200  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C_double = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_H = 400  # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula: C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of bonds\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9\nnum_C_C_double_bonds = 2\n\n# 1.
