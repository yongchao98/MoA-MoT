    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group, known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at carbon 4 (C4), which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   Reaction 2 Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n*   **Lactone Formation:** Delta-lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification (cyclization) of 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids. The precursor to our product is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is at C3, which corresponds to C4 in the final lactone.\n\n*   **Starting Material Structure:** The options suggest the starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name. It is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid), where one carboxylic acid group is a free acid (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n    *   Structure: `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to this problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\nLet's trace the two reaction pathways:\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 untouched.\n    `A (iBu-OOC-R-COOH)` --LiBH₄--> `Intermediate 1 (HO-CH₂-R-COOH)`\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization of the hydroxy-acid to form the delta-lactone.\n    `Intermediate 1` --H⁺--> `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 untouched.\n    `B (iBu-OOC-R-COOH)` --BH₃--> `Intermediate 2 (iBu-OOC-R-CH₂OH)`\n    The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same delta-lactone.\n    `Intermediate 2` --H⁺--> `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3). However, the R/S designation can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n\n**Groups attached to the chiral center (C3) in the starting material:**\n*   G1: `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n*   G2: `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n*   G3: `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n*   G4: `-H`\n**CIP Priority Order:** G1 > G2 > G3 > G4. (The ester group outranks the acid group because O-C has priority over O-H).\n\n**Stereochemical outcome of Reaction 1 (A → (R)-Lactone):**\n*   The reaction converts G1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) into `-CH₂CH₂OH`. G2 (`-CH₂COOH`) remains unchanged.\n*   Let's determine the new priorities in Intermediate 1 (the hydroxy-acid):\n    *   New G1': `-CH₂COOH` (originally G2)\n    *   New G2': `-CH₂CH₂OH` (originally from G1)\n    *   New G3': `-CH₂CH₃` (originally G3)\n*   The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups inverts the R/S designation.\n*   Therefore, to get an (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-acid must be (R). To get an (R)-intermediate, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n*   Path: `(S)-A` → `(R)-Intermediate 1` → `(R)-Lactone`.\n*   Conclusion: **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Stereochemical outcome of Reaction 2 (B → (S)-Lactone):**\n*   The reaction converts G2 (`-CH₂COOH`) into `-CH₂CH₂OH`. G1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains unchanged.\n*   Let's determine the new priorities in Intermediate 2 (the hydroxy-ester):\n    *   New G1': `-CH₂COOiBu` (originally G1)\n    *   New G2': `-CH₂CH₂OH` (originally from G2)\n    *   New G3': `-CH₂CH₃` (originally G3)\n*   The priority order remains the same: New G1' > New G2' > New G3'.\n*   Since the priority order does not change, the R/S designation is retained throughout the reaction.\n*   Therefore, to get an (S)-lactone, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n*   Path: `(S)-B` → `(S)-Intermediate 2` → `(S)-Lactone`.\n*   Conclusion: **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials A and B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
