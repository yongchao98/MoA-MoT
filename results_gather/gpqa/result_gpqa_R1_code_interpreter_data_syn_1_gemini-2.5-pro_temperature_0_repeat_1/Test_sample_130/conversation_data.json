    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its ¹³C spectrum.\n        *   A single ¹H NMR peak at ~7 ppm for a molecule with a C=C double bond suggests two chemically equivalent vinylic protons. This high symmetry, combined with the description, points strongly to **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Let's verify with the ¹³C NMR data. Maleic anhydride has two types of carbon atoms: the two vinylic carbons (C=C) and the two carbonyl carbons (C=O). The chemical shift for vinylic carbons is typically 100-150 ppm, and for carbonyl carbons in an anhydride, it's around 160-170 ppm. The given peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic) and 165 ppm (carbonyl) perfectly match the structure of maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclic diene with a five-membered ring. It has methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   The molecular formula of the product should be the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states that two products (a major and a minor) are formed.\n    *   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* isomer. This is the kinetic product, favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital overlap in the transition state. The *exo* isomer is the minor product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Major (*endo*) Product for NOESY**\n\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). We are looking for a NOE cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent or weak in the minor (*exo*) product. This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n    *   Let's visualize the structures:\n        *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n        *   The C7 bridge is the CH₂ group from the original diene.\n        *   The double bond in the new six-membered ring has two methyl groups on it.\n        *   The bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4) each have a methyl group.\n        *   The anhydride ring is fused to the bicyclic system.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C=C double bond bridge. The two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) are pointing towards the C7 bridge. The C7 bridge has two diastereotopic protons, one pointing towards the double bond (*syn*) and one pointing away (*anti*). In the *endo* geometry, the H_anhydride protons are spatially close to the *anti* proton of the C7 bridge.\n\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side, pointing away from the C7 bridge. In this arrangement, the H_anhydride protons are far from the C7 bridge protons. They are, however, closer to the bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The key spatial difference is the proximity between the H_anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons. This distance is short in the major (*endo*) product and long in the minor (*exo*) product. Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak connecting these two types of protons will be strong in the major product and absent/weak in the minor product.\n\n4.  **Match Protons to NMR Signals and Options**\n\n    *   We need to identify the NMR signals corresponding to the H_anhydride protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n        *   **H_anhydride:** Due to a plane of symmetry in the molecule, the two H_anhydride protons are chemically equivalent. They are not coupled to other protons, so they will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift will be relatively high (~3-4 ppm) because they are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   **C7 bridge protons:** These two protons are chemically non-equivalent (diastereotopic) and will couple to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as two separate **1H doublets**. Their chemical shifts are typically in the 1-2 ppm range for bicyclic systems.\n\n    *   So, the distinguishing NOESY cross-peak in the major product is between a **2H singlet** and a **1H doublet**.\n\n    *   Now let's examine the given options:\n        *   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches our analysis. The 1H doublet is one of the C7 bridge protons, and the 2H singlet is the H_anhydride protons. The chemical shifts are very reasonable for these respective protons.\n        *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This would be a methyl group and a C7 proton. These are not uniquely close in the major product.\n        *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This would be a methyl group and the H_anhydride protons. This interaction is expected to be strong in the minor (*exo*) product, not the major (*endo*) one.\n        *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This would be an interaction between the two different sets of methyl groups. This NOE would be present in both isomers and is not the distinguishing feature.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons and one of the 1H doublets of the C7 bridge protons.\n\n<<<A>>>"
