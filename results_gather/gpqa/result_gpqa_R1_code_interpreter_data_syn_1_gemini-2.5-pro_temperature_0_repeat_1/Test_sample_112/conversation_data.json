    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer, which is broadened by strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carboxylic acid's carbonyl group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is likely a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene functional group. The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, which supports the conclusion from the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak in the FTIR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of C = 12\n        *   Mass of O = 16\n        *   Mass of O = 16\n        *   Mass of H = 1\n        *   Total mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45\n    *   This piece of data provides strong confirmation that the molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   From the combined spectroscopic data, we have established that the unknown compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid's C=O bond represents **one degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   An alkene's C=C bond represents **another degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total of **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining possible formulas (A and C) using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula like 'C6H10O2'.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    c = int(re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula_str).group(1))\n    h = int(re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula_str).group(1))\n    # Formula for DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    dou = c + 1 - (h / 2)\n    return int(dou)\n\n# The two options remaining after initial analysis\nformula_A = \"C6H10O2\"\nformula_C = \"C6H12O2\"\n\ndou_A = calculate_dou(formula_A)\ndou_C = calculate_dou(formula_C)\n\nprint(f\"Formula A ({formula_A}) has a Degree of Unsaturation of: {dou_A}\")\nprint(f\"Formula C ({formula_C}) has a Degree of Unsaturation of: {dou_C}\")\nprint(\"\\nConclusion:\")\nprint(\"The spectroscopic data indicates the presence of one C=O bond (1 DoU) and one C=C bond (1 DoU), for a total of 2 Degrees of Unsaturation.\")\nprint(f\"Only formula {formula_A} has a DoU of 2.\")\n\n```\nExecution Output:\n```\nFormula A (C6H10O2) has a Degree of Unsaturation of: 2\nFormula C (C6H12O2) has a Degree of Unsaturation of: 1\n\nConclusion:\nThe spectroscopic data indicates the presence of one C=O bond (1 DoU) and one C=C bond (1 DoU), for a total of 2 Degrees of Unsaturation.\nOnly formula C6H10O2 has a DoU of 2.\n```\nThe calculation confirms that C₆H₁₀O₂ has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches the structural features identified (one carboxylic acid and one alkene). C₆H₁₂O₂ only has one degree of unsaturation, which is not enough to account for both functional groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Based on the analysis of the provided spectroscopic data:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) stretch.\n    *   Conclusion: The molecule is a carboxylic acid that also contains a double bond. The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the formula must contain two oxygen atoms, eliminating options B (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid, as it corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n4.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Analysis:**\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid (which has one C=O bond) accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   The presence of an alkene (C=C bond) accounts for a **second degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total of **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n        *   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not account for both the C=O and C=C bonds.\n\nThe only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
