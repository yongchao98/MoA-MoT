    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, let's denote its formula as CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This is equivalent to 0.1428, which is very close to 1/7.\n    *   Let's verify the formula type. Mass % H = (Atomic Mass H * y) / (Atomic Mass C * x + Atomic Mass H * y).\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), for a general formula CnH2n (cycloalkanes), the mass % H is (2n * 1) / (12n * 1 + 2n * 1) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n    *   For alkanes (CnH2n+2), the mass % H is (2n+2)/(14n+2), which is always greater than 1/7. For alkynes/alkadienes (CnH2n-2), it's less than 1/7.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n    *   Z is also described as being unreactive towards further hydrogenation, which is consistent with it being a saturated cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and its relationship with Z.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's assume C is Z. So, C = CnH2n (the cycloalkane).\n    *   Since hydrogenation of Y (C+D) gives only Z (CnH2n), the hydrogenation of D must also yield Z. This means D must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated, it must be an aromatic compound. The corresponding aromatic compound with a CnH2n skeleton (like a single ring) would have the formula CnH2n-6 (e.g., benzene C6H6 from cyclohexane C6H12, or toluene C7H8 from methylcyclohexane C7H14). Aromatic compounds do not react with bromine water without a catalyst.\n    *   So, Mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (Z = CnH2n) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (D = CnH2n-6).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the reaction to form Y.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of X also gives only Z (CnH2n). This confirms that A and B also have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is described as a disproportionation. We start with an equimolar mixture (A+B) and end with an equimolar mixture (C+D). This implies a 1:1 stoichiometric reaction: A + B → C + D.\n    *   This reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One reactant donates hydrogen (is oxidized) and the other accepts hydrogen (is reduced).\n    *   The overall reaction is: A + B → (CnH2n-6) + (CnH2n).\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be equal to the total in one molecule of C and one of D.\n    *   Total H atoms = (2n - 6) + 2n = 4n - 6.\n    *   So, if A = CnHx and B = CnH_y, then x + y = 4n - 6.\n    *   A and B are the unsaturated precursors. The reaction involves one of them being oxidized to the aromatic compound and the other being reduced to the cycloalkane. This is not quite right. A more accurate description of the hydrogen transfer is:\n        *   Donor (e.g., A) + Acceptor (e.g., B) → Oxidized Donor (C) + Reduced Acceptor (D)\n        *   So, A (CnHx) + B (CnH_y) → C (CnH2n-6) + D (CnH2n). This is a reshuffling of H atoms. The reaction is a transfer of hydrogen from the more unsaturated component to the less unsaturated one, resulting in the fully aromatic and fully saturated products.\n\n4.  **Evaluate possible carbon skeletons.**\n    *   **Case n=6 (Cyclohexane skeleton):**\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n        *   Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A+B) is x + y = 4*6 - 6 = 18.\n        *   A and B are unsaturated C6 hydrocarbons. A plausible combination with a sum of 18 hydrogens is C6H8 (a cyclohexadiene) and C6H10 (cyclohexene).\n        *   The problem states \"no conjugated multiple bonds\". Cyclohexene fits. For cyclohexadiene, we must choose 1,4-cyclohexadiene, which is non-conjugated, over the conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n        *   So, X = {1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), cyclohexene (C6H10)}. This mixture fits all the conditions.\n        *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n    *   **Case n=7 (Methylcyclohexane skeleton):**\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n        *   Y = {Toluene (C7H8), Methylcyclohexane (C7H14)}.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A+B) is x + y = 4*7 - 6 = 22.\n        *   A and B would be a methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10) and a methylcyclohexene (C7H12). Non-conjugated isomers exist for the diene. This case is also chemically plausible.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms would be 10 + 12 = 22.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios leading to answers 18 (Option D) and 22 (Option C).\n    *   In chemistry problems of this nature, if not otherwise specified, it is common to assume the simplest or most fundamental chemical system that fits the description. The disproportionation of C6 hydroaromatic compounds (cyclohexene, cyclohexadiene) to benzene and cyclohexane is a classic, textbook example of this type of reaction. The C7 system is an analogous but less fundamental example.\n    *   Therefore, the most probable intended answer is based on the C6 skeleton.\n\nLet's finalize the C6 scenario:\n*   **Z**: Cyclohexane (C6H12). Mass % H = 12/(12*6+12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n*   **Mixture Y**: Equimolar mixture of Benzene (C6H6) and Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   **Mixture X**: Equimolar mixture of two liquids that react to form Y. Based on the hydrogen balance (total H = 6 + 12 = 18), and the unsaturation requirement, these are Cyclohexene (C6H10) and a Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   **Constraint**: \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" means the diene must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n*   **Reaction**: C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane). This is a valid hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   **Question**: Total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation**: (H atoms in C6H8) + (H atoms in C6H10) = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nI will run a simple python script to confirm the mass fraction calculation, although it's straightforward.\n```python\n# Using integer atomic masses as implied by 14.28% = 1/7\nmass_H = 1\nmass_C = 12\n\n# For CnH2n formula\nn = 6\nformula = f\"C{n}H{2*n}\"\ntotal_mass = n * mass_C + 2 * n * mass_H\nmass_fraction_H = (2 * n * mass_H) / total_mass\nprint(f\"Formula: {formula}\")\nprint(f\"Mass fraction of H: {mass_fraction_H}\")\nprint(f\"As percentage: {mass_fraction_H * 100:.2f}%\")\n\n# Total H atoms in mixture X for the C6 case\nH_atoms_A = 8  # C6H8\nH_atoms_B = 10 # C6H10\ntotal_H_atoms = H_atoms_A + H_atoms_B\nprint(f\"Total H atoms in mixture X: {total_H_atoms}\")\n```\n>>>\nFormula: C6H12\nMass fraction of H: 0.14285714285714285\nAs percentage: 14.29%\nTotal H atoms in mixture X: 18\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as (mass of H) / (total mass). Let the formula be CxHy. The mass fraction is (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008).\n    *   The value 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Let's test the general formula for cycloalkanes, CnH2n. The mass fraction of hydrogen would be (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7. This is a perfect match.\n    *   For alkanes (CnH2n+2), the fraction is (2n+2)/(14n+2), which is always > 1/7. For any unsaturated non-aromatic hydrocarbon, the fraction is < 1/7.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z does not react further with hydrogen, which confirms it is a saturated compound, consistent with it being a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's say C is Z, so C = CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of D must also yield Z (CnH2n).\n    *   For D to be hydrogenated to Z, it must have the same carbon skeleton as Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene or alkyne. The only remaining possibility is that D is an aromatic hydrocarbon. Aromatic compounds do not react with bromine water (without a catalyst) but can be hydrogenated under severe conditions (as stated in the problem).\n    *   The aromatic compound with a CnHn ring skeleton is CnH2n-6 (e.g., benzene, C6H6, corresponds to cyclohexane, C6H12).\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (CnH2n) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (CnH2n-6).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of X also gives only Z (CnH2n), meaning A and B have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. An equimolar mixture of A and B reacts to form an equimolar mixture of C (CnH2n-6) and D (CnH2n). This implies a 1:1 reaction: A + B → C + D.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C) + (H atoms in D) = (2n - 6) + (2n) = 4n - 6.\n    *   So, the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 4n - 6.\n    *   A and B must be unsaturated versions of Z. The most likely candidates are a cycloalkene (CnH2n-2) and a cycloalkadiene (CnH2n-4).\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen balance: (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6. This matches perfectly.\n    *   The reaction is: CnH2n-4 (cycloalkadiene) + CnH2n-2 (cycloalkene) --(Pt, heat)--> CnH2n-6 (aromatic) + CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n    *   In this reaction, the cycloalkadiene loses 2 hydrogens to become aromatic, and the cycloalkene gains those 2 hydrogens to become the cycloalkane. This is a classic hydrogen transfer.\n\n4.  **Determine 'n' and Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   The most common and fundamental example of this system is based on a 6-carbon ring (n=6).\n    *   Let's assume n=6.\n    *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}.\n    *   A = Cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The problem states \"no conjugated multiple bonds\", so this must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   B = Cyclohexene (C6H10).\n    *   Mixture X = {1,4-cyclohexadiene, cyclohexene}. This mixture fits all the problem's conditions.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H8) + (H atoms in C6H10) = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nTo confirm our logic, we can run a simple calculation.\n```python\n# Let's verify the mass fraction for n=6 and calculate the total hydrogen atoms in mixture X.\n# Atomic masses (approximate)\nmass_H = 1\nmass_C = 12\n\n# Substance Z (Cyclohexane, C6H12)\nn = 6\nformula_Z = f\"C{n}H{2*n}\"\ntotal_mass_Z = n * mass_C + 2 * n * mass_H\nmass_fraction_H_Z = (2 * n * mass_H) / total_mass_Z\n\n# Mixture X components\n# A = Cyclohexadiene, C6H8\n# B = Cyclohexene, C6H10\nH_atoms_A = 8\nH_atoms_B = 10\ntotal_H_atoms_in_X = H_atoms_A + H_atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Mass fraction of H in Z ({formula_Z}): {mass_fraction_H_Z:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"This is {mass_fraction_H_Z*100:.2f}%, which matches the given 14.28%.\")\nprint(f\"Total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X: {total_H_atoms_in_X}\")\n```\n>>>\nMass fraction of H in Z (C6H12): 0.1429\nThis is 14.29%, which matches the given 14.28%.\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X: 18\n<<<D>>>",
    "Based on the detailed step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Substance Z**: The mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28% ≈ 1/7) indicates that Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n. The fact that it's a common solvent and unreactive to further hydrogenation supports this. The simplest and most common example is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Mixture Y**: This is an equimolar mixture of Z (the cycloalkane, CnH2n) and another substance that hydrogenates to Z but doesn't react with bromine water. This points to an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton, CnH2n-6. For n=6, mixture Y is cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Mixture X**: This is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids (A and B) that decolorize bromine water. Both A and B hydrogenate to Z, so they have the same carbon skeleton.\n\n4.  **The Reaction**: Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    A + B → (CnH2n) + (CnH2n-6)\n    By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must equal the sum of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    Total H atoms = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6.\n\n5.  **Identifying A and B**: A and B must be unsaturated precursors. The most logical combination that sums to 4n-6 hydrogens is a cycloalkene (CnH2n-2) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (CnH2n-4).\n    (H atoms in cycloalkene) + (H atoms in cycloalkadiene) = (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6. This is consistent.\n\n6.  **Calculation**: Assuming the most fundamental case where n=6 (the cyclohexane skeleton):\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 4n - 6.\n    *   Total H atoms = 4 * 6 - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n    *   This corresponds to mixture X being cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
