    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core physics principle:** The problem involves an object traveling at a relativistic speed (a significant fraction of the speed of light). This means we need to apply the principles of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, specifically time dilation. Time dilation describes how time passes at different rates for observers in different reference frames. The time experienced by the astronaut on the moving spacecraft (the proper time, Δt₀) will be shorter than the time measured by an observer on Earth (Δt).\n\n2.  **Gather the necessary information:**\n    *   **Speed of the spacecraft (v):** 0.99999987 * c, where c is the speed of light. So, the ratio v/c is 0.99999987.\n    *   **Distance to the destination (d):** The spacecraft travels from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to Earth. The distance to the LMC is approximately 163,000 light-years. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year.\n    *   **Astronaut's initial age:** 22 years.\n    *   **Alien's average lifetime:** 150 years.\n\n3.  **Formulate the equations:**\n    *   The time dilation formula relates the time in the stationary frame (Earth, Δt) to the time in the moving frame (astronaut, Δt₀):\n        Δt = γ * Δt₀\n        where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   Therefore, the time experienced by the astronaut (Δt₀) can be calculated as:\n        Δt₀ = Δt / γ = Δt * √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   The time it takes for the journey as measured from Earth (Δt) is simply the distance divided by the speed:\n        Δt = d / v\n\n4.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   **Step 4.1: Calculate the travel time in Earth's reference frame (Δt).**\n        d = 163,000 light-years = 163,000 * c * years\n        v = 0.99999987 * c\n        Δt = (163,000 * c * years) / (0.99999987 * c)\n        Δt = 163,000 / 0.99999987 years\n        This is very slightly more than 163,000 years.\n\n    *   **Step 4.2: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (Δt₀).**\n        We can combine the formulas:\n        Δt₀ = (d / v) * √(1 - v²/c²)\n        Δt₀ = (163,000 / 0.99999987) * √(1 - (0.99999987)²) years\n\n    *   **Step 4.3: Use a computational tool for precision.**\n        The term `√(1 - (0.99999987)²) ` involves subtracting two numbers that are very close to 1, which can lead to precision errors if done by hand. A Python script is ideal for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ndistance_ly = 163000  # Distance in light-years\nv_ratio = 0.99999987  # Speed as a fraction of the speed of light (v/c)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Earth's reference frame.\n# delta_t_earth = distance / speed = (distance_ly * c) / (v_ratio * c)\ndelta_t_earth = distance_ly / v_ratio\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed for the astronaut (proper time).\n# The formula is delta_t_astronaut = delta_t_earth * sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\nsqrt_term = math.sqrt(1 - v_ratio**2)\ndelta_t_astronaut = delta_t_earth * sqrt_term\n\nprint(f\"{delta_t_astronaut:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n83.11\n</execute_code>\n\n5.  **Analyze the result and conclude:**\n    *   The calculation shows that the time elapsed for the astronaut during the journey is approximately 83.11 years.\n    *   The astronaut's initial age is 22 years. Their age upon arrival at Earth will be 22 + 83.11 = 105.11 years.\n    *   The average lifetime of this alien species is 150 years. Since 105.11 is less than 150, the astronaut will survive the journey. This eliminates option B.\n    *   The calculated travel time of ~83 years is closest to the value given in option A, which is 81 years. The minor difference (~2.5%) can be attributed to using a slightly different value for the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud, as its exact distance is subject to some astronomical uncertainty. Among the given choices, 81 years is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem requires us to calculate the time experienced by an astronaut traveling at a relativistic speed, which is a classic application of Einstein's theory of special relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation.\n\n**1. Identify Knowns and Unknowns:**\n*   **Speed of the spacecraft (v):** 0.99999987 * c, where c is the speed of light. This gives us the ratio v/c = 0.99999987.\n*   **Distance to destination (d):** The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. A standard astronomical value for this distance is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n*   **Astronaut's initial age:** 22 years.\n*   **Alien's average lifetime:** 150 years.\n*   **Unknown:** The time elapsed for the astronaut during the journey (Δt₀), also known as the proper time.\n\n**2. Formulate the Plan:**\n*   **Step A: Calculate the travel time in Earth's reference frame (Δt).** An observer on Earth would measure the time it takes for the spacecraft to cover the distance `d` at speed `v`. The formula is `Δt = d / v`.\n*   **Step B: Apply the time dilation formula.** The time experienced by the astronaut (Δt₀) is shorter than the time measured on Earth (Δt). The relationship is given by the formula:\n    Δt₀ = Δt * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n**3. Execute the Plan:**\n\n*   **Step A: Time in Earth's frame (Δt)**\n    Since the distance is in light-years and the speed is a fraction of the speed of light (c), the calculation is straightforward:\n    Δt = (163,000 light-years) / (0.99999987 * c)\n    Δt ≈ 163,000.02 years.\n    So, from Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 163,000 years.\n\n*   **Step B: Time in the astronaut's frame (Δt₀)**\n    Now we use the time dilation formula. We can combine the steps:\n    Δt₀ = (d / v) * √(1 - v²/c²)\n    Δt₀ = (163,000 / 0.99999987) * √(1 - 0.99999987²) years\n\n    This calculation involves numbers very close to 1, making it ideal for a computer to solve accurately. The Python code from the reasoning process performed this calculation.\n\n**4. Review the Calculation:**\nThe code executed the following calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndistance_ly = 163000\nv_ratio = 0.99999987\n\ndelta_t_earth = distance_ly / v_ratio\ndelta_t_astronaut = delta_t_earth * math.sqrt(1 - v_ratio**2)\n\n# The output was 83.11\n```\nThe journey will take approximately **83.11 years** from the astronaut's point of view.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n*   The astronaut starts at age 22. The journey takes about 83 years.\n*   The astronaut's age upon arrival will be 22 + 83 = 105 years.\n*   Since the average lifetime is 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey. This rules out option B.\n*   The calculated time of ~83 years is closest to option A (81 years). The small difference (~2.5%) is likely due to the problem using a slightly different value for the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (e.g., ~158,000 light-years instead of 163,000). Among the given choices, 81 years is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
