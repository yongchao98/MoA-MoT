    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem deals with uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) and asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$). This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant formulas:**\n    *   The position-momentum uncertainty principle states: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p_x \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, where $\\Delta p_x$ is the uncertainty in momentum in the x-direction and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant ($\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s).\n    *   The relationship between a particle's energy (E) and momentum (p) is needed to connect $\\Delta p_x$ to $\\Delta E$. The derivative $\\frac{dE}{dp}$ gives the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which is equal to the particle's velocity, $v$. Therefore, we can relate the uncertainties as $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{dE}{dp_x} \\Delta p_x = v_x \\Delta p_x$. This relationship holds for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases.\n\n3.  **Formulate the calculation plan:**\n    *   First, calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p_x$) using the position-momentum uncertainty principle.\n    *   Then, use the relationship $\\Delta E = v_x \\Delta p_x$ to find the minimum uncertainty in energy.\n\n4.  **List the given values and constants:**\n    *   Uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 0.1$ nm = $0.1 \\times 10^{-9}$ m = $10^{-10}$ m.\n    *   Velocity of the electron, $v_x = 2 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n    *   Reduced Planck's constant, $\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s.\n\n5.  **Execute the calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Find the minimum uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p_x$).**\n        From the uncertainty principle, the minimum uncertainty is given by:\n        $\\Delta p_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n    *   **Step 2: Find the minimum uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$).**\n        Substitute the expression for $\\Delta p_x$ into the energy-momentum uncertainty relation:\n        $\\Delta E = v_x \\cdot \\Delta p_x = v_x \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n    *   **Step 3: Substitute the numerical values.**\n        $\\Delta E = \\frac{(2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s})}{2 \\cdot (10^{-10} \\text{ m})}$\n\n        Let's perform the calculation using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants and given values\nhbar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck's constant in J·s\nv_x = 2e8  # Velocity of the electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9  # Uncertainty in position in m\n\n# Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy using the formula: delta_E = (v_x * hbar) / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_E = (v_x * hbar) / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"{delta_E:.4e}\")\n```\n\n6.  **Interpret the result:**\n    The code output shows the minimum uncertainty in energy.\n\n1.0546e-16\n\nThe calculated value is $\\Delta E = 1.0546 \\times 10^{-16}$ J.\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) ~10^(-19) J\n    *   B) ~10^(-18) J\n    *   C) ~10^(-16) J\n    *   D) ~10^(-17) J\n\n    The calculated value, $1.0546 \\times 10^{-16}$ J, is approximately $10^{-16}$ J.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core principle:** The problem involves uncertainty in an electron's position ($\\Delta x$) and asks for the minimum uncertainty in its energy ($\\Delta E$). This is a classic application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant formulas:**\n    *   The position-momentum uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty in position and the uncertainty in momentum is at least a certain minimum value:\n        $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p_x \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n        where $\\Delta p_x$ is the uncertainty in momentum in the x-direction, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant ($\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s).\n\n    *   To relate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p_x$) to the uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$), we can use the relationship between a particle's energy and momentum. The derivative $\\frac{dE}{dp}$ represents the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which is equal to the particle's classical velocity, $v$.
