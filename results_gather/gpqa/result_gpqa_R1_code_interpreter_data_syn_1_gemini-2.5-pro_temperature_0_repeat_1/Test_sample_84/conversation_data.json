    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio of Temperatures:** We can write the ratio for the two planets:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same. It also states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    This means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) for each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity ($v_{r,star}$) by the formula:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_{r,star}}{c}$\n    The maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n\n5.  **Connect RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV amplitude $K$ induced on its star is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_{star} + M_p)}{a}}$\n    Since a planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_p \\ll M_{star}$), we can simplify this to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}} = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n    The problem states that the planets were detected by the transit method as well. Transits are only observable when the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, which means the inclination angle $i$ is very close to 90°. Thus, we can assume $\\sin i \\approx 1$ for both planets. The formula becomes:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (K_2^2 M_{star})}{G M_{p1}^2 / (K_1^2 M_{star})}$\n    The terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{M_{p1}^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{K_2^2} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^2$\n    Since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} \\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:** Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n9.  **Final Calculation for Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the value of $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    To get the decimal value, we perform the division.\n\n```python\n# Given values\n# Planet 1\nMp1 = 7  # in Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # in Angstroms\n\n# Planet 2\nMp2 = 5  # in Earth masses\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # in Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is given by (a2/a1)^(1/2)\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a2 / a1 is given by (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\n# The ratio of RV amplitudes K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts d_lambda1 / d_lambda2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of masses\nmass_ratio = Mp2 / Mp1\n\n# Calculate the ratio of Doppler shifts\nshift_ratio = d_lambda1 / d_lambda2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of semi-major axes (a2/a1)\na_ratio = (mass_ratio**2) * (shift_ratio**2)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1/T_eq2)\ntemp_ratio = a_ratio**0.5\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<<<\nD\n>>>",
    "The user wants to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is the temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. The formula is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo (reflectivity).\n\n**2. Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Let's write out the expressions for each planet and divide them:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and cancel out. It also states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ term also cancels out. The equation simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n**3. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe problem provides the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) for each planet, which is used to determine the star's radial velocity amplitude ($K$). The relationship is:\n$K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity amplitude $K$ induced on the star is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n(This is a common approximation where the planet's mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$).\n\nThe problem states the planets were also detected by the transit method. This implies that we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on, so the inclination angle $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$. The formula becomes:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\n**4. Solve for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio ($a_2/a_1$)**\n\nLet's rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n$K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\nNow we can form the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (K_2^2 M_{star})}{G M_{p1}^2 / (K_1^2 M_{star})}$\n\nThe gravitational constant $G$ and the star's mass $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{M_{p1}^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{K_2^2} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^2$\n\nSince $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, the ratio of the amplitudes $K_1/K_2$ is the same as the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} \\right)^2$\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nWe are given:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{0.03}{0.04} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nNow, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nLet's compute the final decimal value using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the planets\n# Planet 1 mass in Earth masses\nMp1 = 7\n# Planet 1 Doppler shift in Angstroms\nd_lambda1 = 0.03\n\n# Planet 2 mass in Earth masses\nMp2 = 5\n# Planet 2 Doppler shift in Angstroms\nd_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is (a2/a1)^(1/2).\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a2 / a1 is (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2.\n# The ratio of RV amplitudes K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts d_lambda1 / d_lambda2.\n\n# Calculate the ratio of masses (Mp2/Mp1)\nmass_ratio_sq = (Mp2 / Mp1)**2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of Doppler shifts (d_lambda1/d_lambda2)\nshift_ratio_sq = (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)**2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of semi-major axes (a2/a1)\na_ratio = mass_ratio_sq * shift_ratio_sq\n\n# Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1/T_eq2)\ntemp_ratio = a_ratio**0.5\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\nThe code output `0.5357142857142857` is approximately 0.536.
