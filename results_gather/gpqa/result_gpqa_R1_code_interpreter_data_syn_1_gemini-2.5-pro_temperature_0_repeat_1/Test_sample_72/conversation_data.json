    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between them.\nb) The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n- Mass of astronaut 1 ($m_1$): $2m$\n- Velocity of astronaut 1 ($v_1$): $0.6c$ (in the positive x-direction)\n- Mass of astronaut 2 ($m_2$): $3m$\n- Velocity of astronaut 2 ($v_2$): $0.5c$ (in the positive x-direction)\n- $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\nSince the astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz transformation for velocities (relativistic velocity subtraction formula). The formula for the relative velocity of object 1 with respect to object 2 is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the given values into the formula:\n$v_1 = 0.6c$\n$v_2 = 0.5c$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nTo compare with the options, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857... c$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts.\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\nThe formula for the relativistic energy of a single particle is:\n$E = \\gamma m_{rest} c^2$\nwhere $m_{rest}$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is given by:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\n**a) Calculate the energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n- $m_1 = 2m$\n- $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\nFirst, find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate the energy $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**b) Calculate the energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n- $m_2 = 3m$\n- $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nFirst, find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3/4}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nNow, calculate the energy $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}}mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\n**c) Calculate the total energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n\nTo compare with the options, calculate the numerical value of the coefficient:\n$\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 2 \\times 1.732) mc^2 = (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nm1 = 2 # in units of m\nv1 = 0.6 # in units of c\nm2 = 3 # in units of m\nv2 = 0.5 # in units of c\n\n# Part 1: Calculate relative speed\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 * v2)\n\n# Part 2: Calculate total energy\n# Lorentz factor for astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\n# Energy for astronaut 1 (in units of mc^2)\nE1 = gamma1 * m1\n\n# Lorentz factor for astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\n# Energy for astronaut 2 (in units of mc^2)\nE2 = gamma2 * m2\n\n# Total energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\nprint(f\"Relative speed (v_rel/c): {v_rel:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Total energy (E_total / (mc^2)): {E_total:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nRelative speed (v_rel/c): 0.14\nTotal energy (E_total / (mc^2)): 5.96\n</execute_code>\n\n**5.
