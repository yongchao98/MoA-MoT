    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Initial State and the Measurement**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1 (p-orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2 (p-orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The magnetic quantum number for the total orbital angular momentum. This means the eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n*   **Measurement:** A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n\n*   **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n### **2. Relate the Coupled and Uncoupled Bases**\n\nThe problem requires us to find the probability of measuring the system in a specific *uncoupled* state $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$ when it is initially in a *coupled* state $|l_1, l_2, l, m>$.\n\nThe connection between these two bases is given by the Clebsch-Gordan expansion:\n$|l_1, l_2, l, m> = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} <l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m> |l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$\n\nThe coefficient $<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>$ is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. The probability of measuring the individual quantum numbers to be $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ is the square of the absolute value of this coefficient:\n$P(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = |<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>|^2$\n\n### **3. Apply the Conservation Rule (Selection Rule)**\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a crucial selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\nThe coefficient $<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>$ is non-zero **only if** $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\nLet's check this condition for our specific problem:\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we have $m = -1$.\n*   From the desired measurement outcome, we have $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum $m_{l1} + m_{l2}$:\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nComparing the sum to the total magnetic quantum number $m$:\n$-2 \\neq -1$\n\nSince $m \\neq m_{l1} + m_{l2}$, the selection rule tells us that the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient must be zero:\n$<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Probability**\n\nThe probability of measuring $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ is the square of this coefficient:\n$P(m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nPhysically, this means it is impossible to find the system in a state where the individual z-components of angular momentum sum to $-2\\hbar$ when we know for certain that the total z-component of angular momentum is $-1\\hbar$. The measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nTo confirm this, we can use a Python script with `sympy` to calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.wigner import clebsch_gordan\nfrom sympy import S\n\n# Quantum numbers from the problem statement\nl1 = 1\nl2 = 1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n\n# Quantum numbers for the desired measurement outcome\nml1 = -1\nml2 = -1\n\n# Calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <l1, ml1; l2, ml2 | l, m>\n# This corresponds to the amplitude of the state |l1, ml1; l2, ml2>\n# in the expansion of the state |l, m>.\ncg_coefficient = clebsch_gordan(S(l1), S(l2), S(l), S(ml1), S(ml2), S(m))\n\n# The probability is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient.\nprobability = abs(cg_coefficient)**2\n\nprint(f\"The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is: {cg_coefficient}\")\nprint(f\"The probability is: {probability}\")\n```\nThe code output confirms the result based on the selection rule.\n```text\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is: 0\nThe probability is: 0\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the probability of measuring specific eigenvalues for the individual z-components of angular momentum ($L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$) when the system is in a known coupled angular momentum state.\n\n### **1. Identify the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system is in the coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   This is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared operator $L^2$ with eigenvalue $l(l+1)\\hbar^2 = 2(2+1)\\hbar^2 = 6\\hbar^2$.\n    *   It is also an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n*   **Measured State:** We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ for both.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   This corresponds to the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n### **2. Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n\nA fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the operator equation:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding magnetic quantum numbers:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nAny transition or measurement that violates this rule is forbidden, meaning its probability is zero.\n\n### **3. Check the Selection Rule**\n\nLet's check if the measurement we are considering is allowed by this rule.\n*   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the individual quantum numbers:\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nNow, we compare this sum to the total magnetic quantum number $m$:\n$-2 \\neq -1$\n\nSince $m \\neq m_{l1} + m_{l2}$, the selection rule is violated.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe initial state has a definite total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. The state we are trying to measure has a total z-component of angular momentum of $(-1\\hbar) + (-1\\hbar) = -2\\hbar$. It is impossible for a system with a total z-component of $-1\\hbar$ to be found in a state with a total z-component of $-2\\hbar$. Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is exactly zero.\n\nThis can also be seen from the Clebsch-Gordan expansion. The probability is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $|<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$. Because the condition $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is not met, this coefficient is zero, and thus the probability is zero. The code execution confirmed this result.\n\n<<<B>>>"
