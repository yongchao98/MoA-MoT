    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and held at a constant potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this V=0 condition. This results in an attractive force between the charge `q` and the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem is most easily solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced surface charges on the sphere, are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The sphere itself is removed in this model.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    For the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) to be zero, the image charge `q'` must be:\n    *   Located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. The position is given by:\n        `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Have a magnitude and sign given by:\n        `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n    Note that since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), the image charge position `b` is inside the sphere (`b < R`), and its sign is opposite to that of `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble it. A key formula for the interaction energy `U` between a point charge `q` and a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge distribution is created by and dependent on the presence of `q`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Induced Potential (V_induced):**\n    Using our image charge model, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n    *   The position of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The position of `q'` is at distance `b` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n    The potential `V_induced` is therefore:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`1 / (4πε₀)`).\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    Now, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b` into the formula for `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n\n    Simplify the denominator:\n    `d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\n    The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancel out:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U):**\n    Now, substitute this expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Let's compare our result with the given choices:\n    A) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` (Incorrect, has R²)\n    B) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` (Incorrect, has d in numerator and + in denominator)\n    C) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` (This matches our derived result)\n    D) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` (Incorrect, missing 1/2 and has d instead of R)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
