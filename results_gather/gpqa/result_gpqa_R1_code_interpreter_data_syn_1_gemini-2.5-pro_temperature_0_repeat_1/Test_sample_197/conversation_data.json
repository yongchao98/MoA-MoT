    "This problem requires us to calculate the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n### 1. Understand the System\nWe have a solution with Co²⁺ ions and SCN⁻ ions, which form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n### 2. Define the Equilibria and Stability Constants\nThe formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β):\n- `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺`\n  `β₁ = [Co(SCN)]⁺ / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n- `Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]`\n  `β₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n- `Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n  `β₃ = [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n- `Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n  `β₄ = [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n\nFrom these definitions, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, and the free thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]`:\n- `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n- `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n- `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n- `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Distribution Coefficient (α)\nThe fraction of a specific complex, such as `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is given by its distribution coefficient, `α₂`:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\nWe can substitute the expressions from step 1 and 2 into this equation:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term is common to all terms in the numerator and denominator, so it cancels out:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThis formula allows us to calculate the fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex using only the stability constants and the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand, `[SCN⁻]`.\n\n### 4. Perform the Calculation\nThe problem provides the necessary values:\n- `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n- `β₁` = 9\n- `β₂` = 40\n- `β₃` = 63\n- `β₄` = 16\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator first:\n- `1` = 1\n- `β₁[SCN⁻]` = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n- `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n- `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n- `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum these terms to find the denominator:\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex:\nNumerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\nNow, calculate `α₂`:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the percentage is 16.9%.\n\nThis calculation can be verified using a simple Python script.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the terms for the denominator (the sum of all species relative to free Co2+)\nterm0 = 1  # for free Co2+\nterm1 = beta1 * (scn_conc**1)\nterm2 = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\nterm3 = beta3 * (scn_conc**3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (scn_conc**4)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator is the term for the species of interest, [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\nThe code output confirms the manual calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>",
