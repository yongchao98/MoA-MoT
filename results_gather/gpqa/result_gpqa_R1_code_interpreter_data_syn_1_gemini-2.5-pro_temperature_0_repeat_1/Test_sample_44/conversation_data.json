    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the System and Single-Particle States\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, spin-1/2 particles are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by a set of quantum numbers. For this system, the quantum numbers are the principal quantum number `n` (for the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (for the spin orientation).\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in this potential are given by:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²)\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n    E_n = n² * E\n*   **Spin States:** For a spin-1/2 particle, `m_s` can be +1/2 (spin up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n*   **State Capacity:** Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, each energy level `n` can hold at most two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down. The two states `(n, m_s=+1/2)` and `(n, m_s=-1/2)` are distinct quantum states.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs)\n\nThe ground state is the state of the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1²E = E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy contributed: 2 × E₁ = 2E\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy contributed: 2 × E₂ = 2 × (4E) = 8E\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    E_gs = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n### 3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. We can find this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   n=1: Two particles. Energy = 2 × E₁ = 2E\n    *   n=2: One particle. Energy = 1 × E₂ = 4E\n    *   n=3: One particle. Energy = 1 × E₃ = 1 × (3²E) = 9E\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n### 4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state that would have a higher energy than the first excited state and find the minimum among them.\n\nLet's list the possible low-energy configurations and their total energies:\n*   **Ground State:** {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}. Energy = 10E.\n*   **First Excited State:** {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. Energy = 15E.\n\nNow, let's find the next possible energy level. We can consider different single-particle or two-particle promotions from the ground state:\n\n*   **Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\n*   **Possibility B: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\n*   **Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** E_2nd = 18E.\n\nTo confirm this result systematically, we can use a Python script to generate all possible configurations and their energies.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies of the ground state and first two excited states for four\n    spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_particles = 4\n    max_occupancy = 2  # For spin-1/2 fermions\n    max_n = 6  # Consider levels up to n=6 to ensure we find the lowest states\n    \n    energies = set()\n\n    # This recursive function explores all ways to place 'particles_left' into levels >= 'level'\n    def find_configurations(particles_left, level, current_energy):\n        # Base case: If all particles are placed, we have a valid configuration.\n        if particles_left == 0:\n            energies.add(current_energy)\n            return\n        \n        # Pruning: If we run out of levels to place particles in, stop this path.\n        if level > max_n:\n            return\n\n        # Recursive step:\n        # Iterate through the number of particles (i) to place in the current level.\n        # i can be 0, 1, or 2.\n        for i in range(max_occupancy + 1):\n            if particles_left >= i:\n                new_energy = current_energy + i * (level**2)\n                find_configurations(particles_left - i, level + 1, new_energy)\n\n    # Start the search from level 1 with 4 particles to place and 0 initial energy.\n    # This is not quite right.

    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the System and Single-Particle States\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. As particles with half-integer spin, they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This means no two fermions can occupy the exact same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number `m_s`.\n*   **Energy Levels:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a single particle in the `n`-th level is:\n    E_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²)\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²). So, the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n    E_n = n² * E\n    For example, E₁ = 1²E = E, E₂ = 2²E = 4E, E₃ = 3²E = 9E, and so on.\n*   **State Occupancy:** For each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states: spin up (↑, m_s = +1/2) and spin down (↓, m_s = -1/2). Therefore, according to the Pauli exclusion principle, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles (one spin up, one spin down).\n\n### 2. Ground State Energy (E_gs)\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with our four fermions.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E₁ = E):** We place the first two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy E₂ = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 × E₂ = 2 × (4E) = 8E.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    E_gs = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n### 3. First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest possible energy. We can find this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level of the ground state to the lowest available unoccupied level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Promotion:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the next available level, which is n=3.\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   n=1: Two particles. Energy = 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n    *   n=2: One particle. Energy = 1 × E₂ = 4E.\n    *   n=3: One particle. Energy = 1 × E₃ = 1 × (9E) = 9E.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n### 4. Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider all possible promotions from the ground state and find the one with the lowest energy increase after the first excitation.\n\n*   **First Excited State (Energy: 15E):** Achieved by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n\nLet's consider other possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Possibility B: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest is the ground state (10E), the next lowest is the first excited state (15E), and the next lowest after that is the second excited state (18E).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies for the three lowest states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
