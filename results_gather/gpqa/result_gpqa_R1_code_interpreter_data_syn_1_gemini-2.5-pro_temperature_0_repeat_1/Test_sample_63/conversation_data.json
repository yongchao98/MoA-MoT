    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data to identify the decomposition products and their quantities.**\n\n*   The initial substance is an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, with a total mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Heating this mixture produces only gases.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. This suggests it is a relatively inert gas. The most likely candidate from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Verify the identity of Gas C using the Law of Conservation of Mass.**\n\nLet's assume Gas C is N₂ and check if the total mass of the products equals the initial mass of the reactants.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis total mass exactly matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) and their quantities is correct.\n\n**3. Determine the elemental composition of the initial mixture.**\n\nThe atoms in the products must have come from the initial salts A and B. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** O is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nSo, the initial 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol of H, 0.20 mol of N, and 0.25 mol of O.\n\n**4. Deduce the chemical formulas of salts A and B.**\n\n*   The salts are in an equimolar mixture. Let's say there are 'n' moles of salt A and 'n' moles of salt B.\n*   The total elemental composition for the combination of one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be in the same ratio as the total moles of elements we found:\n    *   Ratio N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n    *   To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20: N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n*   This means the combined empirical formula for (A + B) is N₄H₈O₅. We need to split this into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   Salts are ionic compounds, composed of a cation and an anion. The elements available are N, H, and O. The only common cation that can be formed is the ammonium ion, NH₄⁺.\n*   Let's assume both salts are ammonium salts. Two NH₄⁺ ions would account for N₂H₈ of our combined formula N₄H₈O₅.\n*   What's left for the two anions is (N₄H₈O₅) - (N₂H₈) = N₂O₅.\n*   We need to split N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions). The most common ones are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   NO₂⁻ + NO₃⁻ = N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are:\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂ (formula N₂H₄O₂)\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃ (formula N₂H₄O₃)\n\n**5. Verify the identification.**\n\nLet's check if an equimolar mixture of these two salts matches the total mass.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14+4(1)+14+2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14+4(1)+14+3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   From our elemental analysis, we know that for the whole mixture: Total moles of N = 0.20 mol. For 'n' moles of each salt, total N = n × (N in A) + n × (N in B) = n×2 + n×2 = 4n.\n    *   4n = 0.20 mol  => n = 0.05 mol.\n*   So, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass. Our identification is correct.\n\n**6. Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (meaning, in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B).\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n*   **Total atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# This code block is for verification of the manual calculation.\n# It confirms the steps of the reasoning process.\n\n# Given data\nmass_mixture = 7.20  # g\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nmass_O2 = 0.80  # g\nvolume_gas_C_STP = 2.24  # L\n\n# Molar masses (approximate)\nM_H2O = 18.0\nM_O2 = 32.0\nM_N2 = 28.0\n\n# Molar volume at STP\nV_m_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate moles of products ---\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nmoles_O2 = mass_O2 / M_O2\nmoles_N2 = volume_gas_C_STP / V_m_STP\n\n# --- Step 2: Check mass conservation ---\ntotal_mass_products = (moles_H2O * M_H2O) + (moles_O2 * M_O2) + (moles_N2 * M_N2)\n\n# --- Step 3: Determine elemental composition ---\nmoles_H = moles_H2O * 2\nmoles_N = moles_N2 * 2\nmoles_O = moles_H2O * 1 + moles_O2 * 2\n\n# --- Step 4 & 5: Verify salt identities and moles ---\n# Proposed salts: A = NH4NO2, B = NH4NO3\n# From elemental analysis, 4*n = moles_N, so n = moles_N / 4\nn = moles_N / 4\nM_NH4NO2 = 64.0\nM_NH4NO3 = 80.0\ncalculated_mass = n * M_NH4NO2 + n * M_NH4NO3\n\n# --- Step 6: Calculate total atoms ---\natoms_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2  # NH4NO2\natoms_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3  # NH4NO3\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Total mass of products: {total_mass_products:.2f} g (Matches initial mass: {mass_mixture:.2f} g)\")\nprint(f\"Moles of each salt (n): {n:.2f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass from proposed salts: {calculated_mass:.2f} g (Matches initial mass)\")\nprint(f\"Total atoms in one formula unit of A (NH4NO2) and B (NH4NO3): {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a chemistry problem. I have already performed the reasoning and generated a Python script to verify the calculations. The script's output confirms my manual reasoning.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Products and Moles:**\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g in the Mg(ClO₄)₂ tube corresponds to 3.60 g of H₂O. Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g in the hot copper tube corresponds to 0.80 g of O₂. Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   The remaining 2.24 L of gas at STP is an inert gas, identified as N₂. Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   The absence of mass change in the Ca(OH)₂ tube means no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) were produced.\n\n2.  **Verify with Mass Conservation:**\n    *   Total mass of products = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(N₂)\n    *   Total mass = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + (0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol) = 3.60 + 0.80 + 2.80 = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming the products and their quantities are correct.\n\n3.  **Determine Elemental Composition of the Mixture:**\n    *   Moles of H = 2 * moles(H₂O) = 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 * moles(N₂) = 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O = 1 * moles(H₂O) + 2 * moles(O₂) = 0.20 + 2 * 0.025 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   The molar ratio of elements in the entire mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. Multiplying by 20 gives an integer ratio of 4 : 8 : 5.\n\n4.  **Deduce Salt Formulas:**\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, so it contains 'n' moles of salt A and 'n' moles of salt B.\n    *   The combined formula for one unit of A and one unit of B is N₄H₈O₅.\n    *   The elements (N, H, O) suggest ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), one for each salt, account for N₂H₈.\n    *   The remaining atoms for the two anions are (N₄H₈O₅) - (N₂H₈) = N₂O₅.\n    *   The two anions that sum to N₂O₅ are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   Therefore, the salts are A = NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite) and B = NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate).\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Atoms:**\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe code output confirms these calculations, showing a total of 17 atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
