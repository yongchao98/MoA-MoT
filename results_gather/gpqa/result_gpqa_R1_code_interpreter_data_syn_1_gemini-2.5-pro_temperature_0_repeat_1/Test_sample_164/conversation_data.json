    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct statement:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Problem:** The goal is to create a polyethylene chain with \"regular branches\" using only ethylene as the monomer. This is a key piece of information. A linear polyethylene chain (HDPE) is formed by simply linking ethylene molecules end-to-end. To create branches, other molecules (comonomers) must be incorporated into the chain. Since the only reactant is ethylene, this comonomer must be created *in-situ* from ethylene itself.\n\n2.  **Identify the Necessary Reaction:** The only way to create a comonomer from ethylene is through oligomerization. For example:\n    *   Two ethylene molecules can be dimerized to form 1-butene.\n    *   Three ethylene molecules can be trimerized to form 1-hexene.\n    *   Four ethylene molecules can be tetramerized to form 1-octene.\n    These molecules (1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene) are alpha-olefins. When they are copolymerized with ethylene, they create regular branches on the polyethylene backbone (ethyl, butyl, and hexyl branches, respectively).\n\n3.  **Define the \"Dual Catalyst System\":** Such a process, known as tandem catalysis, requires two distinct catalyst functions in the same reactor:\n    *   **Catalyst 1 (Oligomerization):** Selectively converts ethylene into a specific alpha-olefin (e.g., 1-hexene).\n    *   **Catalyst 2 (Polymerization):** Copolymerizes the remaining ethylene with the newly formed alpha-olefin to create branched polyethylene (LLDPE).\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Statement based on the Chemistry:**\n\n    *   **A) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\n        *   The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the selective oligomerization of ethylene.\n        *   The most well-known and industrially used catalysts for this reaction (e.g., ethylene trimerization to 1-hexene) are based on chromium.\n        *   These chromium catalysts are activated by co-catalysts, which are typically aluminum-based compounds like methylaluminoxane (MAO) or other alkylaluminum reagents. The activator is essential for the catalyst to function.\n        *   Therefore, the statement that aluminum-based activators \"do not work\" is factually incorrect. They are required.\n        *   **Conclusion: Statement A is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **C) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\n        *   Noble metals include Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt. While some late transition metals (like Ni and Pd) are known to oligomerize or polymerize ethylene, they generally produce a broad distribution of oligomer lengths (a Schulz-Flory distribution).\n        *   This broad distribution would lead to branches of many different lengths, not the \"regular branches\" specified in the problem. The key to making regular branches is a highly selective catalyst that produces predominantly one type of comonomer (e.g., >95% 1-hexene).\n        *   Catalysts based on noble metals are not known for this high selectivity in this context. Therefore, the premise that they \"can be used\" for this specific purpose is incorrect.\n        *   **Conclusion: Statement C is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **D) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n        *   Group VIa (or Group 6) of the periodic table includes Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W).\n        *   As mentioned above, highly selective catalysts for ethylene trimerization (to 1-hexene) and tetramerization (to 1-octene) are based on Chromium (Cr). These are the cornerstone of modern tandem catalysis for LLDPE production.\n        *   These catalysts are used \"in combination with specific activators\" (the aluminum compounds discussed in A).\n        *   Therefore, it is true that a Group VIa metal catalyst can be used.\n        *   **Conclusion: Statement D is correct.**\n\n    *   **B) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\n        *   The technology described is the basis for advanced linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) production processes.\n        *   The Dow Chemical Company, a major US chemical producer, developed and commercialized the UNIPOL™ II process, which uses this exact tandem catalysis approach (in-situ generation of 1-hexene comonomer) in a single gas-phase reactor.\n        *   This process is implemented in large-scale industrial plants, including in the United States.\n        *   **Conclusion: Statement B is correct.**\n\n5.  **Final Decision:** Both statements B and D are factually correct. However, multiple-choice questions usually have only one best answer. Let's analyze the context. The question is posed from the perspective of a research scientist seeking a technical solution for the *formation* of a polymer.\n    *   Statement D describes the fundamental chemical principle—the type of catalyst that enables the desired reaction. This is direct technical advice on *how* to achieve the goal.\n    *   Statement B describes the commercial and geographical status of the technology. While important context for an industrial researcher, it doesn't explain the chemistry.\n\n    Given that the question is about the chemical process of forming a polymer, the statement describing the key chemical component (the catalyst) is the most relevant and fundamental scientific answer. Statement D provides the specific chemical insight needed to solve the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>"
