    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core chemical reactions.**\n    The problem describes a series of reactions involving unknown substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.\n    *   (1) A(s) + 8 B(g) -> C (bright red)\n    *   (2) C + 2 D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)\n    *   (3) C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n    *   (4) D(g) + B(g) -> H (solvent) [1:1 ratio]\n\n2.  **Identify B, D, and H.**\n    Reaction (4) is a 1:1 reaction between two gases (B and D) to form a solvent (H). A very common example of such a reaction is the formation of sulfuryl chloride:\n    SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) -> SO₂Cl₂(l)\n    Sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) is a liquid and is used as a solvent in chemistry. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   Let's assume: **B = SO₂** (sulfur dioxide), **D = Cl₂** (chlorine), and **H = SO₂Cl₂** (sulfuryl chloride).\n\n3.  **Identify G.**\n    Reaction (3) involves the hydrolysis of C to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). Since C is formed from A and B (SO₂), it's highly likely that the hydrolysis of the SO₂ part of the molecule C yields the weak acid.\n    SO₂ + H₂O ⇌ H₂SO₃ (sulfurous acid)\n    Sulfurous acid is a weak acid.\n    *   So, **G = H₂SO₃**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the formation and hydrolysis of C.**\n    *   Reaction (3) states that C hydrolyzes to regenerate A, along with acids F and G. This suggests that C is a complex or adduct containing A and B (SO₂).\n    *   The formation of a strong acid F, which is different from G, implies that A is likely a salt, probably a halide, such that its corresponding hydrohalic acid (a strong acid) is formed. For example, if A is an iodide salt (like KI), F could be HI (hydroiodic acid).\n\n5.  **Identify E.**\n    The main question is about the molecular symmetry of E. Let's focus on Reaction (2):\n    C + 2 D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)\n    Substituting our identified species D = Cl₂:\n    C + 2 Cl₂ -> E\n    The stoichiometry, requiring exactly **2 equivalents** of Cl₂, is a major clue. Let's consider what kind of reaction this could be. A reaction of an iodide salt with excess chlorine proceeds in two steps:\n    Step 1: 2 MI + Cl₂ -> 2 MCl + I₂\n    Step 2: I₂ + Cl₂ -> 2 ICl\n    Overall: MI + Cl₂ -> MCl + ICl (This uses 1 equivalent of Cl₂)\n    However, if more chlorine is used:\n    ICl + Cl₂ -> ICl₃\n    Combining these, the overall reaction from an iodide salt is:\n    **MI + 2 Cl₂ -> MCl + ICl₃**\n    This reaction consumes exactly 2 equivalents of Cl₂ per equivalent of the iodide salt MI. This perfectly matches the stoichiometry of Reaction (2).\n    *   This strongly suggests that **E = ICl₃** (iodine trichloride).\n    *   ICl₃ is a powerful oxidizing agent and is indeed an \"extremely hazardous\" substance.\n    *   This implies that C, whatever its complex structure is, acts as a source of iodide for this reaction. This is consistent with A being an iodide salt (e.g., KI).\n\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (ICl₃).**\n    *   To find the point group of ICl₃, we use VSEPR theory.\n    *   The central atom is Iodine (I).\n    *   Valence electrons of I = 7.\n    *   Electrons from 3 Cl atoms = 3 × 1 = 3.\n    *   Total valence electrons = 7 + 3 = 10.\n    *   This corresponds to 5 electron pairs around the central iodine atom.\n    *   The electron geometry is trigonal bipyramidal.\n    *   There are 3 bonding pairs (I-Cl bonds) and 2 lone pairs.\n    *   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy the equatorial positions. The three chlorine atoms occupy the two axial positions and the remaining equatorial position.\n    *   This arrangement results in a **T-shaped** molecular geometry.\n    *   A T-shaped molecule has a C₂ axis of rotation and two vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   The point group for this symmetry is **C₂v**.\n\n7.  **Final Check.**\n    Our deduction leads to E = ICl₃, which has C₂v symmetry. This is option D. The other clues, while not perfectly reconcilable without resorting to obscure chemistry (the \"bright red\" color and the \"8 equivalents\" for C are likely distractors or refer to a very specific, non-standard system), the deduction based on the clear stoichiometry of Reaction (2) provides a solid path to the answer.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (ICl₃) is C₂v.\n\n<<<D>>>"
