    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore `-C6H4-`.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester has the functional group `-COO-`. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the chemical formula. The ester group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring can be ortho, meta, or para. A para (1,4) substitution pattern often leads to a simple spectrum with two signals due to the molecule's symmetry. Ortho and meta patterns are typically more complex. Therefore, a **para-substituted benzene ring** is the most likely structure. This accounts for 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: `-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   Proton H(a) is split by H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description and accounts for 2 vinyl protons.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 group is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The second -CH3 group must belong to the ester functionality. This suggests either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It eliminates possibilities like ethyl esters (`-COOCH2CH3`), propyl groups (`-CH2CH2CH3`), etc.\n\n### **2. Assemble the Molecular Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can propose two possible structures. Both are para-substituted benzene rings with a propenyl group and an ester group.\n\n*   **Structure 1: Methyl 4-propenylbenzoate**\n    *   The substituents are a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) and a methyl ester group (`-COOCH3`).\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3`\n\n*   **Structure 2: 4-Propenylphenyl acetate**\n    *   The substituents are a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) and an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3`\n\nBoth of these proposed structures are fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **3. Determine the Chemical Formula**\n\nNow, let's determine the chemical formula for these proposed structures.\n\n*   **For Structure 1 (Methyl 4-propenylbenzoate):**\n    *   Carbons (C): 1 (from propenyl CH3) + 2 (from CH=CH) + 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 1 (from COO) + 1 (from ester CH3) = **11 C**\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 3 (from propenyl CH3) + 2 (from CH=CH) + 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from ester CH3) = **12 H**\n    *   Oxygens (O): 2 (from COO) = **2 O**\n    *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n*   **For Structure 2 (4-Propenylphenyl acetate):**\n    *   Carbons (C): 1 (from propenyl CH3) + 2 (from CH=CH) + 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 1 (from COO) + 1 (from acetyl CH3) = **11 C**\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 3 (from propenyl CH3) + 2 (from CH=CH) + 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from acetyl CH3) = **12 H**\n    *   Oxygens (O): 2 (from COO) = **2 O**\n    *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\nBoth plausible structures lead to the same chemical formula: **C11H12O2**.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   For our deduced structure: 1 benzene ring (4 DoU) + 1 C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n\nLet's check the DoU for the given options.\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a C, H, O formula.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    c_match = re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    h_match = re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    C = int(c_match.group(1)) if c_match else 0\n    H = int(h_match.group(1)) if h_match else 0\n    dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n    return dou\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"C11H14O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C11H12O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C12H14O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C12H12O2\"\n}\n\ndeduced_dou = 6\nprint(f\"The DoU calculated from the spectral data is: {deduced_dou}\\n\")\n\nfor key, formula in options.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {key} ({formula}): DoU = {dou}\")\n\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nThe DoU calculated from the spectral data is: 6\n\nOption A (C11H14O2): DoU = 5.0\nOption B (C11H12O2): DoU = 6.0\nOption C (C12H14O2): DoU = 6.0\nOption D (C12H12O2): DoU = 7.0\n```\n*   **A) C11H14O2:** DoU = 5. This does not match our required DoU of 6.\n*   **B) C11H12O2:** DoU = 6. This matches our required DoU and the formula derived from our structural analysis.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** DoU = 6. While the DoU matches, this formula has one more C and two more H atoms than C11H12O2. This corresponds to adding a -CH2- group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n*   **D) C12H12O2:** DoU = 7. This does not match our required DoU of 6.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information (including the number and type of signals, splitting patterns, and the absence of -CH2- groups) is **C11H12O2**.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Based on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, we can deduce the structure and subsequently the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring and Ester:** The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`) and contains an ester group (`-COO-`). The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, 4 hydrogens, and a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 4. The ester's C=O bond adds another degree of unsaturation.\n\n2.  **NMR Signal Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** This strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring, which has a plane of symmetry, resulting in two sets of chemically equivalent aromatic protons. This accounts for 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, d & dq):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The `CH` adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton into a doublet (d). The other vinyl `CH` is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). This group adds 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`-C3H5`) and one C=C double bond (1 DoU).\n    *   **-CH3 Groups (2 signals):** One methyl group is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The other methyl group must be part of the ester.\n    *   **No -CH2 Groups:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`) or have any other alkyl chain with a -CH2- unit. Therefore, the second methyl group must be either from a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure and Formula:**\n    Let's assemble the pieces: a para-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`), a propenyl group (`-C3H5`), an ester group (`-COO-`), and a methyl group (`-CH3`).\n\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (ester CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The structure contains one benzene ring (4 DoU), one C=C double bond (1 DoU), and one C=O double bond (1 DoU). The total DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the formula C11H12O2: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   This matches perfectly. The other options either have the wrong DoU (A and D) or imply the presence of a -CH2- group (C), which is contradicted by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
