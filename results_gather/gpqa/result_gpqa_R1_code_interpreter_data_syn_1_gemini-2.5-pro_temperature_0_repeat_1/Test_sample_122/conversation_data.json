    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference:**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference from which we want to measure the distance traveled by the ejecta.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. The time given (50 seconds) is measured in this frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n*   Relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**3. The Physics: Time Dilation**\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will see time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n\nThe time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is related to the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`) by the time dilation formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**4. Calculation Steps:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    Using the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n    The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the same frame of reference.\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s (time in ejecta's frame)\nc = 300000 # km/s (standard approximation)\n\n# Calculate the classical distance (ignoring relativity) for comparison\nclassical_distance = v * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta_sq = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_sq)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d)\nd = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"Classical distance (for comparison): {classical_distance} km\")\nprint(f\"Lorentz factor (gamma): {gamma}\")\nprint(f\"Time in Galaxy frame (dt): {dt} s\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic distance in Galaxy frame (d): {d} km\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nprint(f\"Classical distance (for comparison): {3000000} km\")\nprint(f\"Lorentz factor (gamma): {1.0206207261596576}\")\nprint(f\"Time in Galaxy frame (dt): {51.03103630798288} s\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic distance in Galaxy frame (d): {3061862.178478973} km\")\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nComparing the calculated result with the given options:\nA) 3,060,000 km\nB) 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic answer)\nC) 2,880,000 km\nD) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option A. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's design. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires applying the concept of time dilation from special relativity.\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame where the time `Δt'` is measured.\n\n**2. List the Given Values:**\n*   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Time in the ejecta's frame (proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**3. Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\nAn observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) compared to the time measured in the moving ejecta's frame (`Δt'`). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame measures about 51.031 seconds.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    The distance `d` is the velocity `v` multiplied by the time `Δt` measured in the same (Galaxy's) frame.\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n**5. Compare with Options:**\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,860 km. This value is extremely close to option A.\n\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if relativistic effects were ignored, i.e., 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\n*   C) 2,880,000 km\n*   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe result from our calculation matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
