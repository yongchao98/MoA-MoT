    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Background: Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the scalar and vector potentials at a field point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are given by:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nHere, $t_r$ is the **retarded time**, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) must have been emitted from the source point $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The signal travels at the speed of light, $c$. Thus, the retarded time is defined by the implicit equation:\n\n$t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Applying to a Moving Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge $q$ with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, we can express the charge and current densities using Dirac delta functions:\n\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe main difficulty in evaluating these integrals is that the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals\n\nTo solve the integral, we can change the integration variable from space ($\\vec{r}'$) to time ($t'$). The integral effectively picks out the contribution from the charge at the unique retarded time $t_r$ when it was at position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n\nA standard derivation (which involves evaluating the integral with the delta function whose argument depends on the integration variable) yields the following result. The volume element $d^3r'$ gets transformed in a way that introduces a correction factor. The effective volume occupied by the charge appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to its motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nWhere all quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$:\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n*   The retarded time $t_r$ is determined by the condition $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n### 4. Final Expressions\n\nLet's rewrite the potentials to match the format of the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThese expressions are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This exactly matches our derived result.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. It uses the static potential form and ignores the crucial retardation effect in the denominator, which depends on the velocity.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. A '+' sign would correspond to advanced potentials (effects preceding their cause), which are typically discarded as unphysical.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect for the same reason as B, and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally and structurally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
