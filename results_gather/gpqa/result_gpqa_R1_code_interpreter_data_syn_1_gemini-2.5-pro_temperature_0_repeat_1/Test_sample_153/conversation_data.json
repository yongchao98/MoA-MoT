    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound (using the most common isotopes) is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n\n*Conclusion from MS:* The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weights of the options.\n```python\n# Calculate the nominal mass of the options using the most common isotopes (C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35).\n# All options have the molecular formula C7H5ClO2.\nmass = 7*12 + 5*1 + 1*35 + 2*16\nprint(f\"The nominal mass for a compound with formula C7H5ClO2 is: {mass}\")\n```\nThe code confirms that all the proposed structures have a nominal mass of 156, consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and unmistakable signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This signal is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*Conclusion from IR:* The compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. This eliminates option **B) Phenyl chloroformate** (which is an acid chloride derivative) and **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which is an aldehyde with a phenol group). We are left with options A and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s) are both consistent with this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key information here is the pattern: there are only two signals, both are doublets, and each represents two equivalent protons. This high degree of symmetry is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The two substituents on the ring are different, causing the two sets of protons to have different chemical shifts.\n    *   In a 1,4-disubstituted ring, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. Each set of protons splits the other into a doublet.\n    *   In contrast, a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) ring, like in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex spectrum (e.g., four different signals, likely multiplets).\n\n*Conclusion from ¹H NMR:* The compound has a carboxylic acid group and a 1,4-disubstituted (para) aromatic ring.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   We need a compound with a molecular weight of 156 containing one chlorine atom. (All options fit).\n*   We need a carboxylic acid. (Eliminates B and C).\n*   We need a para-substituted benzene ring. (Eliminates D).\n\nOnly **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all the spectral data perfectly. It is a carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom in the para position on the benzene ring, which accounts for the IR and the symmetrical NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>",
