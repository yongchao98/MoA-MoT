    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\nThe formula for DoU is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\nDoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester, especially an aromatic ester. It is too high for a simple amide (which is usually < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester group (-COO-).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule implies it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2), which is a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This suggests a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule implies it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3), which is a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a CH₂, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are often due to exchangeable protons. This signal, combined with the IR data, confirms the primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Four protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield, suggesting they are adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester, -COOR). The protons at 7.0 ppm are more upfield, suggesting they are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (like the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the molecule has:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine. Incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acid (CH₃CH₂CO-). The -CH₂- signal would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, not a primary amine attached to the ring. Also, it is meta-substituted, not para. Incorrect.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a para-disubstituted benzene ring with the correct chemical shifts for the aromatic protons.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
