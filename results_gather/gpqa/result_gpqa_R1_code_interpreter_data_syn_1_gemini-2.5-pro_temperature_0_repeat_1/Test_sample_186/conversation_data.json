    "Here is my thinking process to solve this problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Question**\n\nThe goal is to determine how many of the six listed celestial objects can be detected by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a VLT telescope.\n\n**2. Deconstruct the \"Detectability\" Criteria**\n\nThe problem defines \"detectable\" with two main conditions:\n*   **Performance Criterion:** The instrument must be able to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n*   **Geographical Criterion:** The star must be observable from the location of the telescope, which is the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n\n**3. Analyze the Performance Criterion**\n\n*   I need to find the faintest star (i.e., the limiting apparent magnitude, `m_V`) that ESPRESSO can observe to meet the S/N requirement.\n*   The provided link to the ESPRESSO overview page is the primary source: `https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html`.\n*   On that page, under the \"Performance and ETC\" section, a key piece of information is stated: \"The goal of S/N=10 in 1h is reached for a G2V star of V=16.5 mag in the 1-UT mode.\"\n*   This directly answers the performance question. The \"1-UT mode\" means using one Unit Telescope of the VLT, which matches the problem statement.\n*   Therefore, the limiting apparent magnitude for a star to be detectable is **`m_V ≤ 16.5`**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Geographical Criterion**\n\n*   The telescope is at the Paranal Observatory. I need its geographical latitude. A quick search reveals it's approximately **-24.6 degrees**.\n*   For a star to be observable, it must rise above the horizon. For an observer at latitude `λ`, a star with declination `δ` will never rise if it's in a part of the sky that is always obscured by the Earth.\n*   The condition for a star to be *never* visible from a southern hemisphere location (`λ < 0`) is `δ > 90° + λ`.\n*   For Paranal, `λ ≈ -24.6°`. So, a star is never visible if its declination `δ > 90° - 24.6° = 65.4°`.\n*   Therefore, the visibility condition is **`DEC < 65.4°`**.\n\n**5. Evaluate Each Star Against the Criteria**\n\nNow I will go through the list of stars one by one.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** I need its declination. Canopus has a declination of approximately -52.7°. Since `-52.7° < 65.4°`, it is **visible** from Paranal.\n*   **Magnitude:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the sky, with an apparent magnitude `m_V ≈ -0.74`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since `m_V = -0.74 ≤ 16.5`, it is bright enough. It is also visible. Therefore, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris is the North Star, with a declination of approximately +89.3°. Since `89.3° > 65.4°`, it is **not visible** from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because it is not visible, it is **not detectable**, regardless of its brightness.\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 15, distance (d) = 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is 0°. Since `0° < 65.4°`, it is **visible**.\n*   **Magnitude:** I need to calculate the apparent magnitude (`m_V`) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V - M_V = 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n    *   `m_V - 15 = 5 * log10(10) - 5`\n    *   `m_V - 15 = 5 * 1 - 5 = 0`\n    *   `m_V = 15`\n*   **Conclusion:** Since `m_V = 15 ≤ 16.5`, it is bright enough. It is also visible. Therefore, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, M_V = 15, d = 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is 0°, so it is **visible**.\n*   **Magnitude:**\n    *   `m_V - 15 = 5 * log10(200) - 5`\n    *   `m_V - 15 ≈ 5 * 2.301 - 5 = 11.505 - 5 = 6.505`\n    *   `m_V ≈ 21.5`\n*   **Conclusion:** Since `m_V = 21.5 > 16.5`, it is too faint. Therefore, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, M_V = 15, d = 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is 0°, so it is **visible**.\n*   **Magnitude:**\n    *   `m_V - 15 = 5 * log10(5) - 5`\n    *   `m_V - 15 ≈ 5 * 0.699 - 5 = 3.495 - 5 = -1.505`\n    *   `m_V ≈ 13.5`\n*   **Conclusion:** Since `m_V = 13.5 ≤ 16.5`, it is bright enough. It is also visible. Therefore, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, M_V = 15, d = 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is 0°, so it is **visible**.\n*   **Magnitude:**\n    *   `m_V - 15 = 5 * log10(50) - 5`\n    *   `m_V - 15 ≈ 5 * 1.699 - 5 = 8.495 - 5 = 3.495`\n    *   `m_V ≈ 18.5`\n*   **Conclusion:** Since `m_V = 18.5 > 16.5`, it is too faint. Therefore, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n**6.

    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n\n1.  **Visibility:** The star must be observable from the Paranal Observatory's location. The observatory is at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. A star is considered visible if its declination (DEC) is less than 90° + latitude, which is 90° - 24.6° = 65.4°. Therefore, the star must have a declination **DEC < 65.4°**.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star must be bright enough to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio. The problem states a star is detectable if an S/N of at least 10 is achieved in a 1-hour exposure. According to the ESPRESSO overview, this performance is reached for stars with an apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) of 16.5 or brighter. Therefore, the star must have an apparent magnitude **`m_V` ≤ 16.5**.\n\nFor stars where the absolute magnitude (`M_V`) and distance (`d`) are given, we calculate the apparent magnitude (`m_V`) using the distance modulus formula:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`, where `d` is in parsecs (pc).\n\nLet's evaluate each star:\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of -52.7°. Since -52.7° < 65.4°, it is **visible**.\n*   **Brightness:** Canopus has an apparent magnitude `m_V` of -0.74. Since -0.74 ≤ 16.5, it is **bright enough**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris has a declination of +89.3°. Since 89.3° > 65.4°, it is **not visible** from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not detectable.\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15, d = 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is 0°. Since 0° < 65.4°, it is **visible**.\n*   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 - 5 = 15.0`. Since 15.0 ≤ 16.5, it is **bright enough**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15, d = 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is 0°, so it is **visible**.\n*   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (2.301) - 5 ≈ 21.5`. Since 21.5 > 16.5, it is **too faint**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not detectable.\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15, d = 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is 0°, so it is **visible**.\n*   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 ≈ 13.5`. Since 13.5 ≤ 16.5, it is **bright enough**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15, d = 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is 0°, so it is **visible**.\n*   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.699) - 5 ≈ 18.5`. Since 18.5 > 16.5, it is **too faint**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not detectable.\n\nCounting the detectable stars: Canopus, Star (c), and Star (e) are detectable. This gives a total of 3 stars.\n\n<<<C>>>"
