    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This attack breaks the pi bond of the C=O group, forming an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion) represents an acidic aqueous solution and is an excellent proton source for this step. NaHSO₃ is used for a different type of addition reaction (bisulfite addition) and is not suitable here.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** A = H₃O⁺. This narrows down the choices to options A and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water and heat.\n        *   In acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, the nitrile is heated with a strong acid like aqueous HCl or H₂SO₄.\n        *   In base-catalyzed hydrolysis, the nitrile is heated with a strong base like aqueous NaOH, which initially forms a carboxylate salt. An acidic workup is then required to obtain the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis. Looking at the options, HCl is a strong acid and a standard reagent for this transformation. CH₃COOH is a weak acid and is generally not effective enough to hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** B = HCl.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis of the first reaction, A must be H₃O⁺.\n    *   Based on the analysis of the second reaction, B must be HCl.\n    *   Combining these two conclusions, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
