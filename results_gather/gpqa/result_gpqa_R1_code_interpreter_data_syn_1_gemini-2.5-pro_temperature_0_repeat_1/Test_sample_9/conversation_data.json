    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the options provided:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is, by definition, a planet with the same properties as Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given directly as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This describes a \"Super-Earth\". For planets with the same composition, the density changes with mass due to gravitational compression. A more massive planet has stronger gravity, which compresses its constituent materials (like iron and rock) more tightly, leading to a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet will be denser than Earth.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This describes a smaller rocky planet, sometimes called a \"sub-Earth\". Following the same logic as in (c), but in reverse, a less massive planet has weaker gravity. This results in less compression of its materials, leading to a lower overall density compared to Earth.\n\n2.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n    *   Planet (c) is more massive than Earth and has the same composition, so its density must be *greater* than Earth's density (~5.51 g/cm³).\n    *   Planet (d) is less massive than Earth and has the same composition, so its density must be *less* than Earth's density (~5.51 g/cm³).\n\n3.  **Quantitative Estimation (Optional but helpful):**\n    We can use a simplified model for rocky planets where the radius (R) scales with mass (M) as R ∝ M^k, where k is approximately 0.27. Density (ρ) is M/V, and Volume (V) ∝ R³.\n    *   ρ ∝ M / R³ ∝ M / (M^k)³ = M / M^(3k) = M^(1-3k).\n    *   Using k ≈ 0.27, we get ρ ∝ M^(1 - 3*0.27) = M^0.19.\n    *   This confirms that density increases with mass.\n    *   For planet (c), with 5 times Earth's mass, the density would be roughly 5^0.19 ≈ 1.4 times Earth's density. This would be approximately 1.4 * 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ 7.7 g/cm³.\n    *   For planet (d), with 0.5 times Earth's mass, the density would be roughly 0.5^0.19 ≈ 0.88 times Earth's density. This would be approximately 0.88 * 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ 4.8 g/cm³.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n    *   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (estimated ~7.7 g/cm³)\n    *   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (estimated ~4.8 g/cm³)\n\n    Comparing these values, the planet in option (c) clearly has the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
