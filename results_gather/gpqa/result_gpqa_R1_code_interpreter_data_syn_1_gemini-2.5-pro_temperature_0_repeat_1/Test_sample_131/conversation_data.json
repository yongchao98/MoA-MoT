    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. All four options have this molecular formula.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds. This means that the total number of protons from each compound is equal in the sample. Since all compounds are C10H14, they each contribute 14 protons.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their integration for each potential compound. This is based on the chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of 4 x 3H = **12H**.\n    *   *Summary for Durene:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (related by the symmetry plane). This gives one **singlet** for **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. This gives one **singlet** for **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique. This gives one **singlet** for **3H**.\n    *   *Summary for Isodurene:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Although adjacent, they form an AA' system which appears as a **singlet**. Integration is **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet** for **6H**.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet** for **6H**.\n    *   *Summary for Prehnitene:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent. They will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The problem states the aliphatic signals are all singlets. This compound has ethyl groups, which will show splitting (a quartet for the -CH2- and a triplet for the -CH3). Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated immediately**. This rules out option A.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the remaining options in a 1:1 ratio and see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give all singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives a 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for all the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the 1:1 ratio is met.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show a total of **four aliphatic singlets**, which contradicts the data (three signals).\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the 1:1 ratio is met.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show at least **four aliphatic singlets** (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This contradicts the data (three signals).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
