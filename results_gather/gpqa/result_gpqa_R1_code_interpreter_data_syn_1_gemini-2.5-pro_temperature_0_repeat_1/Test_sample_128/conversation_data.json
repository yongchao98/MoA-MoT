    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to identify compound E.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   **Hint (a)** states that Compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide in a Wittig reaction to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.\n*   The Wittig reaction converts a carbonyl group (C=O) into an alkene (C=C). The structure of the product tells us about the two reactants: the carbonyl compound (A) and the ylide.\n*   The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The `(propan-2-ylidene)` part, which is `(CH₃)₂C=`, comes from the phosphorous ylide. The ylide is therefore triphenylphosphonium isopropylide, `Ph₃P=C(CH₃)₂`.\n*   The rest of the molecule, the `1,2-dimethylcyclopentan-4-one` skeleton, must come from Compound A. To find the structure of A, we replace the `C=C(CH₃)₂` double bond in the product with a carbonyl group `C=O`.\n*   The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Reversing the reaction gives a ketone at position 4 of a 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane ring.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbonyl group is given the lowest possible number (1). Therefore, Compound A is **3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one**.\n*   **Hint (b)** supports this structure. The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak at ~1750 cm⁻¹. This frequency is characteristic of a C=O stretch in a five-membered ring (cyclopentanone), which is more strained than a six-membered ring or an acyclic ketone.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction A → B**\n\n*   Compound A (3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one) reacts with HCN. This is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group, forming a cyanohydrin.\n*   Compound B is **1-cyano-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction B → C**\n\n*   Compound B is reduced with H₂ in the presence of a Palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the nitrile group (-C≡N) to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂). The alcohol group is unaffected.\n*   Compound C is **1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction C → D → E**\n\n*   Compound C, a primary amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This is a diazotization reaction. The primary amine group (-CH₂NH₂) is converted into an unstable diazonium salt (-CH₂N₂⁺), which is Compound D.\n*   Compound D readily eliminates a molecule of nitrogen gas (N₂), which is the \"inert gas\" mentioned in the problem. This loss of N₂ generates a highly unstable primary carbocation.\n*   This intermediate carbocation undergoes a rapid rearrangement known as the **Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement**. In this process, one of the adjacent carbon atoms from the ring migrates to the carbocation center, leading to a ring expansion from a five-membered ring to a six-membered ring.\n*   The migration of a C-C bond from the cyclopentane ring results in the formation of a more stable six-membered ring (cyclohexanone). The positive charge shifts to the carbon that was originally part of the ring and bore the hydroxyl group. This intermediate quickly loses a proton to form the final ketone, Compound E.\n*   Let's trace the atoms: The 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone skeleton expands to a cyclohexanone skeleton. The methyl groups were on carbons 3 and 4 of the original five-membered ring. After the expansion, they end up on adjacent carbons in the new six-membered ring.\n*   The resulting structure is a dimethylcyclohexanone. By tracing the positions, we find the methyl groups are on positions 3 and 4 relative to the new carbonyl group (using the lowest locant rule for IUPAC naming).\n*   Therefore, Compound E is **3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n*   **Hint (b)** confirms this transformation. The IR spectrum of E shows a peak at ~1715 cm⁻¹. This is the typical C=O stretching frequency for a six-membered ring ketone (cyclohexanone), which is less strained than a cyclopentanone. The shift from 1750 cm⁻¹ (Compound A) to 1715 cm⁻¹ (Compound E) is a classic indicator of a ring expansion from five to six members.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the reaction sequence and the spectroscopic data, Compound E is 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
