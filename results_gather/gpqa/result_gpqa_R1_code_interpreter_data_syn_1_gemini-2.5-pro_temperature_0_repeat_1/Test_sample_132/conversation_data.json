    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and the buffer system.**\n    The solution contains KH2PO4, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate), and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which dissociates into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and water. The H2PO4- ion is a weak acid, and the HPO4^2- ion is its conjugate base. Together, they form a phosphate buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Determine the relevant chemical equilibria.**\n    The pH of this buffer is primarily determined by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the H2PO4- / HPO4^2- pair:\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻, with the acid dissociation constant Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\n    The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻, with the acid dissociation constant Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol.\n\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻, [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = (1.00 / 136.09) mol / 0.200 L\n\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻, [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = (1.00 / 177.99) mol / 0.200 L\n\n    Since the extent of dissociation and hydrolysis is small, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components with their initial concentrations.\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺].**\n    Using the equilibrium expression for Ka₂:\n    Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻].**\n    Using the equilibrium expression for Ka₃:\n    Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the desired concentration, [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\n    We will now use a Python script to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Define the given constants and values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # in grams\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # in g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # in grams\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # in g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # in Liters\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components\nmoles_h2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nconc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L\n\nmoles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\nconc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# The ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles, so we can use that directly.\nh_plus_conc = Ka2 * (moles_h2po4 / moles_hpo4)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n# We use the calculated concentration of HPO4^2- and the calculated [H+].\npo4_conc = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4 / h_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation to compare with the options\nprint(f\"{po4_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\nThe solution is created by dissolving KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O in water.\n*   KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into 2Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H₂O.\nThe key species are H₂PO₄⁻ (a weak acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (its conjugate base). They form a buffer solution.\n\n**2. Identify Relevant Equilibria**\nThe phosphate system has three dissociation steps for phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n1.  H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ (Ka₁ = 7.5x10⁻³)\n2.  H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸)\n3.  HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²)\n\nOur solution is a buffer based on the second equilibrium (H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻).
