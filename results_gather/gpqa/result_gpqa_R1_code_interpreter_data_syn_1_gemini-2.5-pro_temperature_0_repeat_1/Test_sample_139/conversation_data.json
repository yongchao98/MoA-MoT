    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" & Clue 5: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**\n        This strongly suggests the use of deuterium (D, an isotope of hydrogen, H) for isotopic labeling in organic reactions. Many common reagents have deuterated analogs.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, which contains at least three oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces the oxygen count from three to two implies the reduction of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol group (-CH₂OH), as this process removes one oxygen atom. This requires a very strong reducing agent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a classic reagent for this transformation. This makes LiAlH₄ a prime candidate for the \"close analog\" and its deuterated version, **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, the candidate for Substance X.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: \"reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms\"**\n        Let's test our hypothesis that X is LiAlD₄.\n        *   Strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄ react violently with protic solvents like water. So the reaction is violent.\n        *   If X is LiAlD₄, it contains deuterium. To produce a gas W made only of deuterium (D₂), the liquid Y must also be a source of deuterium. The most common choice is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   Let's check the gas W = D₂. A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons, which perfectly matches the clue.\n        *   The reaction would be: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n        *   In this reaction, aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is formed. Al(OH)₃ is a known gelatinous precipitate, so it's logical that Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate (G). This fits the clue.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: \"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   We identified G as Al(OD)₃. Heating a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) typically causes dehydration (or de-deuteration) to form the metal oxide and water (or heavy water).\n        *   Reaction: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n        *   This means substance B is D₂O (heavy water).\n        *   The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C. To convert to Kelvin: K = 3.82 + 273.15 = 276.97 K.\n        *   276.97 K is indeed \"very close to 277 K\". This confirms our identification.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It also specifies that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 27), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (represented by D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula. We will use integer atomic mass numbers for the calculation, which is standard for this type of problem (D≈2, Al≈27).\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen/Deuterium): There are 4 atoms of D in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Cumulative mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Al in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Cumulative mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Total cumulative mass = (Mass from D) + (Mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis calculation can be verified with a simple script.\n\n```python\n# Using integer atomic mass numbers for the isotopes in LiAlD4.\n# Mass number of Deuterium (D) is 2.\n# Mass number of Aluminum-27 (the only stable isotope) is 27.\n\n# The formula is LiAlD4.\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium). There are 4 atoms.\n# The heaviest element is Aluminum. There is 1 atom.\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass of all atoms of the lightest element.\nmass_of_deuterium_atoms = 4 * 2\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass of all atoms of the heaviest element.\nmass_of_aluminum_atoms = 1 * 27\n\n# Sum the two results as per the question.\ntotal_cumulative_mass = mass_of_deuterium_atoms + mass_of_aluminum_atoms\n\nprint(total_cumulative_mass)\n```\n<execute_code>\n35\n</execute_code>\nThe result of the calculation is 35. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 25\nB) 35\nC) 31\nD) 29\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
