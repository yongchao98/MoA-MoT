    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:**\n    The problem involves a relativistic particle, $X^0$, that decays after traveling some distance in a bubble chamber. Due to relativistic effects (time dilation), the particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). Consequently, the distance it travels before decaying (the decay length, $L$) is also longer. The decay process is statistical, described by an exponential decay law.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    -   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    -   Total energy of $X^0$ in the lab frame: $E = 27$ GeV\n    -   Rest mass of $X^0$: $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$. This means its rest energy is $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n    -   Condition: We need to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Condition:**\n    \"To observe a decay\" means we must be able to resolve the track of the parent particle $X^0$ before it decays. This requires the particle to travel a distance $L$ that is greater than the detector's spatial resolution, let's call it $\\Delta x_{res}$.\n    The condition \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\" means that for at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles, their decay length $L$ must be greater than the resolution $\\Delta x_{res}$. This can be written as a probability statement:\n    $P(L > \\Delta x_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n\n4.  **Formulate the Mathematical Model:**\n    The decay of particles follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ before decaying is described by the probability density function $P(x) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n    The probability of a particle surviving beyond a distance $\\Delta x_{res}$ (i.e., having a decay length $L > \\Delta x_{res}$) is:\n    $P(L > \\Delta x_{res}) = \\int_{\\Delta x_{res}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\lambda} e^{-x/\\lambda} dx = e^{-\\Delta x_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    Combining this with our condition from step 3, we get:\n    $e^{-\\Delta x_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n    The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". A smaller resolution value means a better detector. The condition sets an upper bound on the resolution value: $\\Delta x_{res} \\le -\\lambda \\ln(0.3)$. The \"minimum resolution\" in this context refers to the largest possible value of $\\Delta x_{res}$ that still satisfies the condition. Therefore, we solve for the equality:\n    $\\Delta x_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3)$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    The mean decay length $\\lambda$ is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is given by $\\lambda = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau$ is its lifetime in the lab frame.\n    -   First, we find the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$.\n    -   The lifetime in the lab frame is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    -   The velocity is $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n    -   So, $\\lambda = (\\beta c)(\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau_0$.\n    A more direct way to calculate the term $\\beta\\gamma$ is using energy and momentum. From the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$, we get $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$.\n    Since $p = \\gamma m_0 v = \\gamma m_0 (\\beta c)$, we have $pc = \\beta \\gamma (m_0c^2)$.\n    Therefore, $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{m_0c^2}$.\n    The mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\beta\\gamma c \\tau_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    We can use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given constants\nE = 27  # Energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41 # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16 # Proper lifetime in s\nc = 299792458 # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate pc in GeV\npc = np.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in meters\n# lambda = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\nmean_decay_length = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\n\n# The resolution 'dx' is found from the condition P(L > dx) = 0.3\n# exp(-dx / lambda) = 0.3  =>  dx = -lambda * ln(0.3)\nresolution = -mean_decay_length * np.log(0.3)\n\nprint(f\"{resolution:.3e}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.268e-06\n\n7.  **Analyze the Result and Select the Answer:**\n    The calculation gives a required resolution of approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    Let's compare this result with the given options:\n    A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\n    Our calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close in order of magnitude and value to option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The small discrepancy (about 9%) is likely due to slight inaccuracies in the values provided in the problem statement or the options.

Understand the Physics and the Question**\n\n*   **Relativistic Time Dilation:** A particle moving at a relativistic speed has a longer lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) compared to its own rest frame (proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$). The relationship is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Decay Length:** The average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is the mean decay length, $\\lambda = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability that a particle will travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(L > x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the detector resolution, let's call it $\\Delta x_{res}$, such that we can observe the decay track for at least 30% of the particles. This means for 30% of the particles, their decay length $L$ must be greater than the resolution: $P(L > \\Delta x_{res}) \\ge 0.30$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Equations**\n\n1.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** From the relativistic energy equation $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$, we can find $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n\n2.  **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The mean decay length is $\\lambda = v \\tau = (\\beta c)(\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta\\gamma c \\tau_0$.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum spatial resolution a detector (like a Bubble Chamber) needs to have to observe the decay of the particle $X^0$. \"Observing the decay\" means being able to see the track of the $X^0$ particle before it decays into $Y^+$ and $Z^-$. This requires the particle to travel a distance, $L$, that is at least as long as the detector's resolution, $\\Delta x_{res}$. The condition is that this must happen for at least 30% of all $X^0$ particles produced.\n\n**2. Relativistic Effects**\n\nThe particle $X^0$ is moving at a very high speed, so we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The particle's lifetime in the laboratory's frame of reference ($\\tau$) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$). This is given by the formula $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Mean Decay Length:** The average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is called the mean decay length, $\\lambda$. It is calculated as $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity in the lab.\n\n**3.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    In the CERN Bubble Chamber a decay occurs, $X^{0}\\rightarrow Y^{+}Z^{-}$ in \\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}s, i.e. the proper lifetime of X^{0}. What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.\n\nA) 2.08*1e-1 m\nB) 2.08*1e-9 m\nC) 2.08*1e-6 m\nD) 2.08*1e-3 m\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",
