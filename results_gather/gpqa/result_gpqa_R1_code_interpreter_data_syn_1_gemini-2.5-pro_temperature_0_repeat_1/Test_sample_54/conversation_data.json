    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n*   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃).\n*   **Multiplicity (s):** The 's' stands for singlet, which means this methyl group has no protons on adjacent atoms.\n*   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group, specifically an acetyl group (CH₃-C=O).\n*   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to the acetate methyl group present in all four possible compounds.\n\n**2. Analyze the Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n*   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n*   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region, indicating a proton on a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). The downfield shift suggests it is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom like oxygen (-O-CH=).\n*   **Multiplicity (d):** The 'd' stands for doublet, meaning this proton is coupled to (split by) only one other proton.\n*   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information from this signal. For protons on a double bond, a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) is characteristic of a **trans** relationship. A smaller coupling constant (typically 6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* relationship.\n*   **Conclusion:** The J value of 16.0 Hz definitively indicates a **trans** double bond. This eliminates the *cis* isomers, so we can rule out **C) Cis-butenyl acetate** and **D) Cis-propenyl acetate**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n*   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group (CH₃).\n*   **Multiplicity (d):** The 'd' for doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This indicates a CH₃-CH- fragment.\n*   **Conclusion:** This signal points towards a propenyl group (CH₃-CH=CH-) rather than a butenyl group (like CH₃CH₂-CH=CH-), where the terminal methyl would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH₂ group.\n\n**4. Analyze the Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n*   **Integration (1H):** This is the second vinylic proton.\n*   **Multiplicity (dq):** The 'dq' stands for doublet of quartets. This means the proton is split by two different groups of neighbors:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It is coupled to one other proton. This is the other vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm. The coupling constant for this interaction must be 16.0 Hz.\n    *   **Quartet (q):** It is coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (a methyl group). This corresponds to the methyl group seen at 1.6 ppm.\n*   **Conclusion:** This splitting pattern confirms the CH₃-CH=CH- structure. The proton at 5.5 ppm is the one in the middle of this fragment, being split by both the methyl group and the other vinylic proton.\n\n**5. Final Identification**\n*   The J-coupling of 16.0 Hz confirms a **trans** alkene.\n*   The splitting patterns of the signals at 1.6 ppm (doublet) and 5.5 ppm (doublet of quartets) confirm the presence of a **propenyl** group (CH₃-CH=CH-).\n*   Putting it all together, the compound has an acetate group, a trans double bond, and a propenyl group. The structure is trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nThe data is a perfect match for **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
