    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay:**\n    Radioactive decay is a random, memoryless process. The probability that a single atomic nucleus will survive (not decay) for a time `t` is described by the exponential decay law:\n    `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant, a characteristic of the specific atom.\n\n    Consequently, the probability that the atom will decay *within* a time `t` is:\n    `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n    Using the formula from step 1:\n    `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    Rearranging the equation to solve for the survival probability term:\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n    This equation relates the decay constant `λ` to the known probability. We don't necessarily need to calculate the exact value of `λ` yet; we can use this relationship directly.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Question as a Probability Statement:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    Let `T` be the time of decay. The question asks for the conditional probability:\n    `P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50)` which is `P(T < 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    A key feature of exponential decay is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already survived. The atom doesn't \"age.\"\n    Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand-new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n    So, the problem simplifies to calculating:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    We need to calculate `1 - e^(-150λ)`. We can use the relationship we found in step 2: `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    Let's manipulate the exponent:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Now, substitute the value from step 2:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    Finally, calculate the decay probability:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are given that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%.\n# P_decay(100) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.32\n# This means exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n\n# We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, this is equivalent to\n# the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n# P_decay(150) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150)\n\n# We can express exp(-lambda * 150) in terms of exp(-lambda * 100):\n# exp(-lambda * 150) = exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-lambda * 100))^1.5\n# So, P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nprobability = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"{probability * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nThe calculation `1 - (0.68)^1.5` results in approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    A) 40%\n    B) 52%\n    C) 44%\n    D) 48%\n\n    The calculated value of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Model the Decay Process:** Radioactive decay is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a nucleus will *not* decay (i.e., survive) for a time `t` is given by `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant specific to the atom. The probability that it *will* decay within time `t` is `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Relationship for λ:** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n    *   `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   Solving for the exponential term: `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   This equation gives us the survival probability for 100 minutes. We can use this to find the probability for any other time interval without explicitly calculating `λ`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** A key characteristic of radioactive decay is that it is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that 50 minutes have passed without a decay does not change the atom's intrinsic decay probability for the future. Therefore, the question \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\" is equivalent to asking \"What is the probability a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\".\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n    *   We can rewrite the exponential term `e^(-150λ)` using the relationship we found in step 2:\n        `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    *   Now, substitute the value `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`:\n        `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Finally, calculate the decay probability:\n        `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** The calculation `1 - (0.68)^1.5` was performed by the Python script.\n    *   `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n    *   This probability is 43.93%.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of 43.93% is closest to the given option C, 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
