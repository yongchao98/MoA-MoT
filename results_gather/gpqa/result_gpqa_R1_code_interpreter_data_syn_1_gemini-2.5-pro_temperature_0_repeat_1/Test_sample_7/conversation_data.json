  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2.**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` results in 0% resistance. This is the most severe phenotype observed, indicating G2 plays a critical role in the resistance pathway.\n    *   The double mutant `g1g2` also has 0% resistance. The phenotype of the `g2` mutant completely masks the phenotype of the `g1` mutant (75% resistance).\n    *   Similarly, the double mutant `g2g3` has 0% resistance, masking the phenotype of the `g3` mutant (50% resistance).\n    *   This phenomenon, where a mutation in one gene (G2) masks the phenotypic effects of mutations in other genes (G1 and G3), is called **epistasis**. The gene whose phenotype is expressed (G2) is said to be epistatic to the genes whose phenotypes are masked (G1 and G3).\n    *   In a genetic pathway, an upstream gene is often epistatic to downstream genes. Since the problem states that one of the genes is a transcription factor (a type of upstream regulator), it is highly probable that **G2 is this transcription factor**. Its product is required to activate the rest of the resistance pathway. This conclusion eliminates option D, which suggests G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n2.  **Analyze the interaction between Gene G1 and Gene G3.**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` has 75% resistance (a loss of 25%).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` has 50% resistance (a loss of 50%).\n    *   The double mutant `g1g3` has 10% resistance (a loss of 90%).\n    *   If the genes acted independently, we might expect the combined loss of resistance to be additive (e.g., 25% + 50% = 75% loss, for 25% remaining resistance). However, the observed loss (90%) is much greater than the sum of the individual losses.\n    *   This synergistic effect, where the double mutant shows a much more severe phenotype than either single mutant (or their sum), is a hallmark of **gene redundancy**. This means G1 and G3 likely have partially overlapping functions. They both contribute to the resistance phenotype, possibly through parallel pathways, and the loss of one can be partially compensated for by the other. When both are lost, the function is almost completely abolished.\n    *   This finding strongly supports the \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" part of option A. It makes option C (\"pleiotropy,\" which is the wrong term for a gene-gene interaction) incorrect. It also makes option B (\"same promoter\") less likely to be the primary conclusion; \"redundancy\" is a functional conclusion derived from the phenotypes, whereas \"same promoter\" is a structural hypothesis that isn't directly proven by this data.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the final clause in the options regarding epistasis between G1 and G3.**\n    *   Option A states \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". For this to be true, the phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant (10% resistance) would have to be the same as the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance). This is clearly false.\n    *   Option B states \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\". This would require the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) to match the `g3` phenotype (50%). This is also false.\n    *   Therefore, neither G1 nor G3 is epistatic to the other in the classical sense. Their interaction is synergistic.\n\n4.  **Select the best overall conclusion.**\n    *   **Option A:** States G2 is a TF (Correct), G1/G3 are redundant (Correct), and G1 is epistatic to G3 (Incorrect).\n    *   **Option B:** States G2 is a TF (Correct), G1/G3 have the same promoter (Less direct conclusion than redundancy), and G3 is epistatic to G1 (Incorrect).\n    *   **Option C:** States G2 is a TF (Correct), G1/G3 show pleiotropy (Incorrect term), and G1 is epistatic to G3 (Incorrect).\n    *   **Option D:** States G1 is a TF (Incorrect).\n\n    Comparing the options, Option A contains two strongly supported and accurate conclusions derived directly from the experimental data: G2's role as an upstream regulator (transcription factor) and the redundant nature of G1 and G3. Although its third clause about epistasis is incorrect, it is the best overall description among the choices. The other options contain more significant errors or less precise conclusions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
