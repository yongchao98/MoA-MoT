    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe substituents have the following directing effects for electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-OEt**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -tBu is *ortho* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *meta* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *ortho* to -tBu.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly and typically requires a multi-step synthesis involving blocking groups or functional group manipulations.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nWe will analyze each option step-by-step to see if it leads to the desired product. We will keep track of the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. For clarity, we'll initially number the substituents based on their order of introduction relative to the first substituent placed on the ring.\n\n---\n\n#### **Analysis of Option A**\n\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-butylbenzene.**\n    *   This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. We now have a -tBu group on the ring. Let's place it at C1.\n    *   Intermediate: **tert-butylbenzene** (tBu at C1).\n\n*   **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO₃H group to the sterically less hindered *para* position (C4). The sulfonic acid group will serve as a blocking group.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **iii) 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is nitration. We have an *o,p*-director (-tBu at C1) and a *m*-director (-SO₃H at C4).\n    *   The -tBu group directs to C2 and C6 (ortho positions).\n    *   The -SO₃H group directs to C2 and C6 (meta positions).\n    *   Both groups direct the nitration to the same positions (C2/C6). The reaction proceeds cleanly.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, NO₂ at C2, SO₃H at C4). Note that the -tBu and -NO₂ groups are *ortho* to each other.\n\n*   **iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is the reduction of the nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   Intermediate: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, NH₂ at C2, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **v) ... + NaNO₂/HCl → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is the diazotization of the primary amine.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, N₂⁺ at C2, SO₃H at C4).\n\n*   **vi) ... + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is a second nitration. Let's analyze the directing effects on the diazonium salt intermediate.\n    *   -tBu at C1 is an *o,p*-director (directs to C6, as C2/C4 are substituted).\n    *   -N₂⁺ at C2 is a *m*-director (directs to C4/C6, C4 is substituted).\n    *   -SO₃H at C4 is a *m*-director (directs to C2/C6, C2 is substituted).\n    *   All three groups direct the incoming nitro group to C6. This is a highly specific reaction.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C1, N₂⁺ at C2, SO₃H at C4, NO₂ at C6).\n\n*   **vii) ... + H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol.**\n    *   This step involves two key transformations that occur upon heating in aqueous acid:\n        1.  **Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt**: The -N₂⁺ group at C2 is replaced by an -OH group.\n        2.  **Desulfonation**: The -SO₃H group at C4 is removed and replaced by -H.\n    *   The resulting molecule has: -tBu at C1, -OH at C2, and -NO₂ at C6.\n    *   Intermediate: **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **viii) ... + dilute H₂SO₄**\n    *   This step is likely redundant or ensures the completion of the previous step.\n\n*   **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.**\n    *   This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol (-OH) is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether.\n    *   The -OH group on 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol is converted to an -OEt group.\n    *   Final Product has: -tBu at C1, -OEt at C2, -NO₂ at C6 (using the original numbering).\n    *   **Let's determine the IUPAC name of this final product.** The -OEt group has the highest priority for numbering, so its carbon is the new C1.\n        *   Original C2 (with -OEt) becomes New C1.\n        *   Numbering towards the next substituent gives the lowest locants: Original C1 (with -tBu) becomes New C2. Original C6 (with -NO₂) becomes New C3.\n        *   The locants are 1, 2, 3.\n        *   The name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   This matches the target molecule. Therefore, sequence A is a valid and high-yield pathway.\n\n---\n\n#### **Analysis of Other Options (Briefly)**\n\n*   **Option B & C:** Both start by nitrating tert-butylbenzene (step ii), which predominantly forms the *para* isomer (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene). Starting with a 1,4-disubstituted compound makes it very difficult to achieve the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern in a high-yield synthesis. Furthermore, step (iv) in option B (NaNO₂/HCl) is applied to an intermediate without an amino group, which is incorrect. Step (vii) in option C leads to an isomer of the target, not the target itself.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, converting it into a deactivating, *meta*-directing group (-NH₂-AlCl₃). This would lead to *m*-tert-butylaniline, which does not have the required substitution pattern for subsequent steps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions described in Option A is the only one that correctly utilizes blocking groups and directing effects to systematically build the desired 1,2,3-substituted aromatic ring with high regioselectivity at each step.\n\n<<<A>>>"
