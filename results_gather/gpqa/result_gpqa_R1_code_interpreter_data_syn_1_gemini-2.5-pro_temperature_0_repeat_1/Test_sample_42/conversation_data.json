    "Here is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   It contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group.\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid is the highest priority functional group.\n*   Therefore, the parent structure is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n### 2. Place the Substituents on the Benzene Ring\n\nLet's map out the substituents based on the description:\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH (by definition).\n*   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO, formyl) and Cyano (-CN):** These are *meta* to the carboxylic acid (i.e., at C3 or C5) and also *meta* to each other. This confirms they are at positions C3 and C5.\n*   **Methoxy (-OCH3):** This is *para* to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position **C4**.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2):** These are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid, so they are at positions C2 and C6.\n\nSo far, the partial structure is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C4: -OCH3\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN\n\n### 3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure\n\nThe final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n\n*   The methoxy group is fixed at C4. For it to be ortho to the nitrile (-CN), the nitrile must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous finding.\n*   The alcohol (-OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile. Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n    *   **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4. For the alcohol to be ortho, it must be at **C2**.\n    *   **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4. For the alcohol to be ortho, it must be at **C6**.\n\nThis gives us two potential arrangements which are mirror images of each other and thus represent the same molecule. We just need to apply IUPAC numbering rules to decide which direction to number in.\n\nLet's use the arrangement from Case 1, which corresponds to numbering clockwise from C1:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH (hydroxy)\n*   **C3:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\nThe alternative (counter-clockwise) numbering would be:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxy)\n\n### 4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\n*   The principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1.\n*   We must number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the other substituents. In both clockwise and counter-clockwise numbering, the set of locants is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   When the locant sets are identical, we assign the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically. Note that for 'dimethylamino', the prefix 'di-' is part of the name of the substituent and is considered for alphabetization.\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**.\n*   In the clockwise numbering scheme, 'cyano' is at position **3**.\n*   In the counter-clockwise numbering scheme, 'cyano' is at position **5**.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **clockwise numbering scheme is correct**.\n\n### 5. Assemble the Final Name\n\nUsing the correct (clockwise) numbering, we have:\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nNow, we list these alphabetically to construct the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 6. Compare with the Options\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order)\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Correct**)\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
