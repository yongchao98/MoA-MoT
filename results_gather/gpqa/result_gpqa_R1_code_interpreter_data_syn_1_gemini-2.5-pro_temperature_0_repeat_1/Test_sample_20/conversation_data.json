    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in dynamic equilibrium and can be easily interconverted. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom that is adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring containing two carbon-carbon double bonds and two carbonyl groups opposite each other.\n    *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the C=O groups). The carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   However, these alpha-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds within the ring. They are sp² hybridized and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   These methylene groups are located between two carbonyl groups, making their hydrogen atoms (alpha-hydrogens) particularly acidic.\n    *   The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form.\n    *   The enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. Due to the high stability of the aromatic ring, the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, A = benzoquinone.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, meaning it will have a non-superimposable mirror image (an enantiomer).\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, which restricts rotation.\n    *   Let's check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Alternatively, the molecule is essentially planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the entire molecule.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is superimposable on its mirror image and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
