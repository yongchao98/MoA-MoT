    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is the same in all directions, which is evident from its dependence only on the radial distance $r$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separating variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The total potential is $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$, which is a sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials.\n\n    The energy of a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\n    For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies from the three independent dimensions:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    We can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Determine the Energy Levels and Degeneracy:**\n    *   **Ground State (n=0):** This is the lowest energy state.\n        *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0$. The only possible combination of non-negative integers is $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n        *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n        *   Degeneracy (number of states): 1.\n\n    *   **First Excited State (n=1):**\n        *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 1$. The possible combinations are $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, 0)$, and $(0, 0, 1)$.\n        *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n        *   Degeneracy: 3.\n\n    *   **Second Excited State (n=2):**\n        *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 2$. The possible combinations are:\n            *   Permutations of (2, 0, 0): (2, 0, 0), (0, 2, 0), (0, 0, 2) -> 3 states.\n            *   Permutations of (1, 1, 0): (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1) -> 3 states.\n        *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n        *   Total Degeneracy: 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n    *   **Third Excited State (n=3):**\n        *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. We need to find all combinations of three non-negative integers that sum to 3.\n        *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n        *   To find the degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions), we count the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n            *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) -> 3 states.\n            *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) -> 6 states.\n            *   Permutations of (1, 1, 1): (1, 1, 1) -> 1 state.\n        *   Total Degeneracy: 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n4.  **General Formula for Degeneracy:** The number of ways to distribute $n$ identical items (the total quantum number) into $k$ distinct bins (the dimensions, here $k=3$) is a classic combinatorics problem. The formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the $n$-th level is:\n    $g_n = \\binom{n+k-1}{k-1} = \\binom{n+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{n+2}{2} = \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n    This confirms our manual counting.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   The energy of the third excited state ($n=3$) is $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy is its degeneracy, which is $g_3 = 10$.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        *   A) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3 - Incorrect degeneracy.\n        *   B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3 - Incorrect energy formula and degeneracy.

    "The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Energy Eigenvalues\n\nThe potential can be written in Cartesian coordinates as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. The Hamiltonian for this system is separable into three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators, one for each coordinate axis.\n\nThe energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by:\n$E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nFor the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies from the three independent dimensions:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nWe can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe energy levels are determined by the value of the principal quantum number $n$.\n*   **Ground State:** $n=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** $n=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** $n=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same total energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\nLet's list the possible combinations:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — 3 states\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — 6 states\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1) — 1 state\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ for the $n$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be calculated using the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state ($n=3$) is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for this energy is 10. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
