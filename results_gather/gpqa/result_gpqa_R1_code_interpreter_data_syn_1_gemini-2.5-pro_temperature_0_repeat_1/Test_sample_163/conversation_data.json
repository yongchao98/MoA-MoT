    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M_sys1 / M_sys2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where radial velocities of both stars are measured), the total mass (M_total = M1 + M2) is related to the orbital period (P), the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2), and the inclination of the orbit (i) by the following formula:\n    \n    M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))\n    \n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial velocity amplitudes (K1_1, K1_2) = 10 km/s, 5 km/s\n        *   The system is eclipsing.\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial velocity amplitudes (K2_1, K2_2) = 15 km/s, 10 km/s\n        *   The system is eclipsing.\n\n4.  **Interpret the \"Eclipsing\" Information:** The fact that both systems exhibit eclipses is crucial. It implies that we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on. For an edge-on orbit, the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees. Therefore, sin(i) ≈ 1, and sin^3(i) ≈ 1 for both systems.\n\n5.  **Set up the Mass Ratio:** We want to calculate the ratio M_sys1 / M_sys2.\n    \n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [ (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (2πG * sin^3(i1)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3) / (2πG * sin^3(i2)) ]\n    \n    Since sin^3(i1) ≈ 1 and sin^3(i2) ≈ 1, and the constant term (2πG) is the same for both, these terms cancel out. The equation simplifies to:\n    \n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Sum of Velocities for Each System:**\n    *   **System 1:** K_total_1 = K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:** K_total_2 = K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n7.  **Substitute the Values into the Ratio Formula:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K_total_1 = 15 km/s\n    *   K_total_2 = 25 km/s\n    \n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)\n    \n    Note that as long as the units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) are consistent between the numerator and denominator, the conversion factors to SI units will also cancel out.\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:** To ensure accuracy, we can use a simple calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters for System 1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_total = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# Define the parameters for System 2\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_total = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the mass ratio (proportional to System 1's mass)\nnumerator = P1 * (K1_total**3)\n\n# Calculate the denominator for the mass ratio (proportional to System 2's mass)\ndenominator = P2 * (K2_total**3)\n\n# Calculate the final ratio\nmass_ratio = numerator / denominator\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n>>>\n0.432\n<<<D>>>",
    "The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is given by the formula:\n\nM_total = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))\n\nwhere:\n*   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars (M1 + M2).\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This is a crucial piece of information, as it implies that the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin^3(i) ≈ 1.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M_sys1) to the mass of system_2 (M_sys2).\n\nRatio = M_sys1 / M_sys2\n\nUsing the formula for mass:\n\nRatio = [ (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (2πG * sin^3(i1)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3) / (2πG * sin^3(i2)) ]\n\nSince sin^3(i1) ≈ 1 and sin^3(i2) ≈ 1, and the term 2πG is a constant, they cancel out. The formula simplifies to:\n\nRatio = (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values from the problem:\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K1_1 + K1_2) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K2_1 + K2_2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\nRatio = (2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)\nRatio = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625)\nRatio = 6750 / 15625\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 0.4\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
