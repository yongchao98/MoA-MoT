    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting material (C8H9NO) from the NMR data.**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBEs (3 double bonds + 1 ring). This leaves 1 DBE, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a CH2 group).\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for an amine group (-NH2). The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A signal for two protons, appearing as a doublet. This corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a single proton (a CH group). This fits with the -CH2- group being next to the -CHO group.\n    *   **Assembling the structure:**\n        *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n        *   Let's verify the connectivity and NMR splitting. If the structure is p-aminophenylacetaldehyde (H2N-C6H4-CH2CHO), the aldehyde proton (-CHO) is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be a triplet. The -CH2- protons are adjacent to the -CHO proton, so they should form a doublet. This matches the data perfectly.\n    *   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** The starting compound is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n    *   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O.**\n        *   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n        *   First, the primary amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) in a process called diazotization to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        *   Second, the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by adding water (and usually gentle warming), which replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and releases nitrogen gas (N2).\n        *   The product after these two steps is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (HO-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n\n    *   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n        *   This set of reagents corresponds to a base-catalyzed aldol condensation. The starting material for this step is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which has two acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group).\n        *   **Mechanism:**\n            1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-hydrogen to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n            2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to form an aldol addition product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (C).\n            4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The α-hydrogen and the β-hydroxyl group are eliminated to form a double bond between the α and β carbons. This creates a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is thermodynamically more stable.\n            *   Aldol Adduct: (HO-Ph)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO\n            *   Dehydration (-H2O): → (HO-Ph)-CH2-CH=C(Ph-OH)-CHO\n        *   **Final Product:** The final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. Let's name it according to IUPAC rules. The main chain is a but-2-enal. There are two 4-hydroxyphenyl substituents, one at position 2 and one at position 4. The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n    *   The final product we derived is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n    *   This matches option (A).\n    *   Option (C) is the intermediate aldol addition product, which is not the final product under heating conditions.\n    *   Options (B) and (D) have incorrect structures.\n\n<<<A>>>"
