    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information**\n\n*   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbons:** 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbons.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\nBased on the information above, we can assemble the molecule:\n*   We have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, where X = Cl, Br, or I).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities for the 2-carbon, carbonyl-containing group:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This group has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. If this is attached to the halobenzene ring, the resulting molecule is a **haloacetophenone** (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃). This structure has 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond. This is a perfect fit.\n*   **Formylmethyl group (-CH₂CHO):** This group also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl (aldehyde). The resulting molecule would be a **(halophenyl)acetaldehyde** (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO). This structure also fits all the initial criteria.\n\nSo, we have two primary candidate structures. Now we must predict their 1H NMR spectra and see which one matches the given options. Since the options show simple splitting patterns (doublets), it's highly likely we are dealing with a *para* (1,4) substituted isomer, which is symmetrical.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Candidate Structures**\n\n*   **Candidate 1: *para*-haloacetophenone (p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The ring is substituted with a halogen (-X, weakly deactivating/ortho-para directing) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃, strongly deactivating/meta directing). The molecule is symmetrical. We expect two signals for the aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be further downfield than the protons ortho to the halogen. This will result in two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The typical chemical shift range is ~7.5-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. They will appear as a singlet (s) integrating to 3H. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone attached to an aromatic ring is ~2.5-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** ~7.9 ppm (2H, d), ~7.6 ppm (2H, d), ~2.6 ppm (3H, s).\n\n*   **Candidate 2: *para*-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde (p-X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The ring is substituted with a halogen (-X) and a formylmethyl group (-CH₂CHO). The -CH₂- group acts as an insulator, so the electron-withdrawing effect of the aldehyde on the ring is much weaker than in the acetophenone case. The aromatic protons would be further upfield, typically in the ~7.2-7.4 ppm range. We would still expect two doublets of 2H each due to para substitution.\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This proton is highly deshielded and appears far downfield, typically ~9.5-10.0 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CH₂- group, so it should be split into a triplet (t).\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH₂-):** These protons are benzylic and adjacent to a carbonyl. They would appear around ~3.6-3.8 ppm. They are adjacent to the aldehyde proton, so they should be split into a doublet (d).\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** ~9.7 ppm (1H, t), ~7.3 ppm (4H, two doublets), ~3.7 ppm (2H, d).\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). It cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum has an aldehyde proton (9.9 ppm) and a methylene group (3.7 ppm), suggesting the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure. However, there are two major inconsistencies:\n        1.  The aromatic protons (7.8, 7.6 ppm) are too far downfield for this structure. These shifts imply a strongly deactivating group is *directly* attached to the ring.\n        2.  The splitting is incorrect. The aldehyde proton and methylene protons should be a triplet and a doublet, respectively, due to coupling. They are listed as singlets.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H), which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which has 4 aromatic protons). It cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is an excellent match for our prediction for **p-haloacetophenone**.\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d):** This is the classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring with an electron-withdrawing group. The chemical shifts are in the correct range.\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a 3H singlet, characteristic of a methyl group. Its chemical shift is in the expected region for an acetyl methyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   This option is chemically consistent and accurately describes the spectrum of a molecule that fits all the initial criteria.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe data in option D is a textbook match for *para*-haloacetophenone, which fits all the structural requirements given in the problem. The other options are either inconsistent with an aromatic structure or contain significant chemical shift and splitting pattern errors.\n\n<<<D>>>"
