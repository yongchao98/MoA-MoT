    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product's Structure from the NMR Data**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction. The product has the same molecular formula as the starting material, C11H12O, as this is a rearrangement reaction.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O). The multiplicity 's' (singlet in broadband decoupled spectrum) indicates it's a quaternary carbon, which is typical for a ketone. The chemical shift suggests it is conjugated, likely an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   There are two signals in the aliphatic region at **δ 21.3 ppm** and **δ 28.4 ppm**, corresponding to two different methyl groups.\n    *   In the aromatic/vinylic region (δ 120-150 ppm), there are several signals. The presence of signals at **δ 126.9 (2C)** and **δ 129.1 (2C)**, each integrating to two carbons, is a strong indication of a **para-substituted benzene ring**. The remaining four signals in this region must correspond to the two quaternary carbons of the benzene ring and the two carbons of a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signals at **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)** are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. These correspond to the two methyl groups identified in the ¹³C NMR. The singlet nature means they have no adjacent protons.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic/vinylic region are: **δ 6.75 (1H, d)**, **δ 7.08 (2H, d)**, **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**, and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**.\n    *   The two doublets integrating to 2H each (**δ 7.08** and **δ 7.71**) confirm the presence of a **para-substituted benzene ring**. The large chemical shift difference between them suggests the ring is attached to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the conjugated ketone system).\n    *   The two doublets integrating to 1H each (**δ 6.75** and **δ 7.68**) are characteristic of two protons on a trans-disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-), which are coupled to each other.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring. One of the methyl singlets (e.g., δ 2.31, with a typical ¹³C shift of δ 21.3) is likely the substituent on this ring, forming a **p-tolyl group** (p-CH₃-C₆H₄-).\n    *   The other fragments are the second methyl group (-CH₃), the double bond (-CH=CH-), and the ketone group (C=O).\n    *   Assembling these pieces to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone gives the structure **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    *   Structure: **p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃**\n    *   This structure is consistent with all the NMR data:\n        *   It has a p-tolyl group (one methyl, p-substituted ring).\n        *   It has a second methyl group attached to the ketone (acetyl group). Both methyl groups would be singlets.\n        *   It is an α,β-unsaturated ketone, which explains the conjugated C=O shift and the deshielded vinylic and aromatic protons.\n        *   The formula is C₁₁H₁₂O, which matches.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material, a vinyl epoxide, is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base, at a high temperature (403 K = 130 °C). This is a classic base-catalyzed vinyl epoxide rearrangement. This reaction typically converts a vinyl epoxide into an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\n*   **Mechanism:** The base deprotonates the carbon that is alpha to both the double bond and the epoxide ring. The resulting anion leads to the opening of the epoxide ring, and subsequent tautomerization of the resulting enolate yields the α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\n*   **Evaluate the Options:** Now we must determine which of the proposed starting materials (Compound X) would yield the identified product.\n    *   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound has a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), not a p-tolyl group. It cannot form the product which contains a p-tolyl group.\n    *   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound also has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. It cannot be the starting material.\n    *   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** This compound has a 4-methylstyryl group, which contains a p-tolyl moiety (p-CH₃-C₆H₄-). Its structure is p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂. Its molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe rearrangement of **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (C)** via the base-catalyzed mechanism described above would produce **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, the product identified from the NMR spectra. Therefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\np-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂  ---(DABCO, 130°C)-->  p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n(Compound X from option C)                               (Product identified from NMR)\n\n<<<C>>>"
