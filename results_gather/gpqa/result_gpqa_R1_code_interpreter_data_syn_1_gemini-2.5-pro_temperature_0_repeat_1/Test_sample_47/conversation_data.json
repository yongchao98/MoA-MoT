    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered ring with a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate. One of the alpha-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetric, bromination at either alpha-position (C2 or C6) yields the same product.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (a strong base) with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** An alpha-halo ketone treated with a strong base typically undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement.\n    1.  The base (OH-) abstracts an acidic proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack, displacing the bromide from C2 and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the ring opens to form a more stable carbanion. This involves the cleavage of a C-C bond of the cyclopropane ring, leading to a ring contraction.\n    5.  The final product after protonation (during workup) is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *(Note: An alternative E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is less likely and would not be compatible with the reagent in the next step, which is specific for carboxylic acids.)*\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl produced.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol. The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n    ```\n          H(a)\n          |\n        O=C\n          |\n      H(b)-C1\n         /   \\\n    (c)H-C2---C5-H(c')\n    (d)H |     | H(d')\n         |     |\n    (e)H-C3---C4-H(e')\n    (f)H \\     / H(f')\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C, H, O), the C1 atom, the H attached to C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** We count the sets of hydrogens that are in unique chemical environments.\n    1.  **The aldehyde hydrogen (H_a):** This hydrogen is unique. (1 set)\n    2.  **The hydrogen on C1 (H_b):** This hydrogen is on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 set)\n    3.  **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 is equivalent to C5. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other. C1 is a stereocenter, which makes the two geminal protons on the adjacent carbon (C2) diastereotopic. This means they are in different chemical environments and are distinct. Let's call them H_c and H_d. By symmetry, the two protons on C5 are equivalent to the two on C2 (H_c' is equivalent to H_c, and H_d' is equivalent to H_d). This gives us two more sets of distinct hydrogens. (2 sets)\n    4.  **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** Similarly, C3 is equivalent to C4 by the plane of symmetry. The two geminal protons on C3 (H_e and H_f) are also diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. By symmetry, the protons on C4 are equivalent to those on C3. This gives us another two sets of distinct hydrogens. (2 sets)\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n    *   Set 2: C1-H (1 proton)\n    *   Set 3: C2-H & C5-H (one type, 2 protons total)\n    *   Set 4: C2-H & C5-H (other type, 2 protons total)\n    *   Set 5: C3-H & C4-H (one type, 2 protons total)\n    *   Set 6: C3-H & C4-H (other type, 2 protons total)\n\nSumming these up, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
