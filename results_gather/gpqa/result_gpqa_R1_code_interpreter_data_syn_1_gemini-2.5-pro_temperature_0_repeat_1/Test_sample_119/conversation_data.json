    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Key Quantities:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. For a star at distance `d` (in parsecs), its parallax `plx` (in arcseconds) is given by `plx = 1/d`. This means `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Uniform Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number of stars per unit volume (the number density, `ρ`) is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   **Target Quantity:** We need to find how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with `plx`. This is a rate, which can be written mathematically as `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars.\n\n2.  **Relating Number of Stars to Volume and Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the Earth. Let the shell have a radius `d` and a very small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`):\n        `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n3.  **Converting from Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   Our expression for `dN` is in terms of distance (`d` and `dd`), but the question asks for the relationship with parallax (`plx`). We need to substitute the distance variables with parallax variables.\n    *   We know `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We also need to find the relationship between the thickness `dd` and a small range of parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = (-1/plx²) d(plx)`. Since we are counting stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n        `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n    *   The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing both sides by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ) / plx⁴`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the relationship is:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n    *   This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
