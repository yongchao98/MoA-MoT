    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the setup:** We have a neutral spherical conductor with an off-center cavity. A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   A net negative charge will be attracted to the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). By applying Gauss's Law to a surface just inside the conductor material enclosing the cavity, we can determine the total induced charge on the inner surface. Since the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero, the net flux through this Gaussian surface is zero. This implies the total charge enclosed must be zero. Therefore, the induced charge on the inner surface must be exactly $-q$ to cancel the $+q$ charge placed inside.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). To maintain its overall neutrality, if a charge of $-q$ has accumulated on the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage):** A crucial principle of electrostatics is that a closed conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside the shell. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced *only* by the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. The combined electric field from the original charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface is zero for all points outside the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. This outer surface is a sphere of radius $R$. Because the conducting material shields the outer surface from the influence of the charges inside the cavity (which are not symmetrically placed), and since there are no other external charges, the charge $+q$ on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly. A uniform distribution is the only way to ensure the spherical outer surface is an equipotential, as required for a conductor in equilibrium with no external fields.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** Now, the problem is simplified to finding the electric field at point P due to a uniformly distributed charge $+q$ on a spherical shell of radius $R$.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a direct consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at an external point due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge is $+q$.\n    *   The center is the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is given as $L$.\n\n6.  **Final Formula:** Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The parameters $s$ (cavity displacement), $r$ (cavity radius), $l$ (distance from P to cavity center), and $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are provided as distractors to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.\n    *   Option A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. Depends on internal geometry.\n    *   Option B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct. This matches our derivation.\n    *   Option C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. This would be the field if the conductor were absent and the charge was at the cavity's center.\n    *   Option D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. Depends on internal geometry.\n\nThe correct answer is determined by the fundamental principles of electrostatic induction and shielding in conductors.\n\n<<<B>>>"
