    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics Principles\n\nThe problem involves two key concepts from physics:\n*   **Radioactive/Particle Decay:** The number of particles, N, that have not decayed after a time, t, is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)\n    where N₀ is the initial number of particles and τ is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving at a relativistic speed has a longer lifetime in the observer's frame (the lab frame) compared to its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime). The relationship is:\n    τ_lab = γ * τ₀\n    where τ_lab is the lifetime in the lab frame, τ₀ is the proper lifetime (a constant for a given particle type), and γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Equations\n\nLet's apply these principles to the given scenario.\n\n*   The particles are created at the center of a spherical detector of radius R = 30 m.\n*   They travel at ultra-relativistic speeds, so we can approximate their speed `v ≈ c` (the speed of light).\n*   The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector wall, as measured in the lab frame, is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall is `N / N₀`. Using the decay law with the time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) and the lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`):\n\nN / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n\nN / N₀ = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ₀))\n\nThis equation connects the fraction of surviving particles (N/N₀) to the Lorentz factor (γ). The values R, c, and τ₀ are constants in this problem.\n\n### 3. Use the Initial Condition\n\nWe are given the first condition:\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n*   Fraction of survivors, (N/N₀)₁ = 1/3\n\nPlugging these into our equation:\n\n1/3 = exp(-(R / c) / (20 * τ₀))\n\nTo solve for the unknown constants, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -(R / c) / (20 * τ₀)\n-ln(3) = -(R / c) / (20 * τ₀)\nln(3) = (R / c) / (20 * τ₀)  --- (Equation 1)\n\n### 4. Use the Final Condition\n\nWe want to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂, that results in a new fraction of survivors:\n*   Fraction of survivors, (N/N₀)₂ = 2/3\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₂ = ?\n\nPlugging these into the general equation:\n\n2/3 = exp(-(R / c) / (γ₂ * τ₀))\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm:\n\nln(2/3) = -(R / c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)\n-ln(3/2) = -(R / c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)\nln(3/2) = (R / c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)  --- (Equation 2)\n\n### 5. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)\n\nWe now have a system of two equations. The term `(R / c) / τ₀` is common to both. Let's rearrange both equations to isolate this term:\n\nFrom Equation 1: (R / c) / τ₀ = 20 * ln(3)\nFrom Equation 2: (R / c) / τ₀ = γ₂ * ln(3/2)\n\nSince both expressions are equal to the same constant, we can set them equal to each other:\n\nγ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)\n\nNow, we can solve for γ₂:\n\nγ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))\n\n### 6. Calculate the Numerical Value\n\nTo get the final numerical answer, we can use a simple python script to compute the value of the expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given initial Lorentz factor\ngamma1 = 20\n\n# The relationship derived is gamma2 = gamma1 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))\n# where ln(1.5) is ln(3/2)\ngamma2 = gamma1 * (math.log(3) / math.log(1.5))\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n<execute_code>\n54.1903320626139\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. Looking at the multiple-choice options:\nA) 54\nB) 40\nC) 28\nD) 68\n\nThe value 54.19 is extremely close to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem relates the fraction of surviving particles to their Lorentz factor. The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that survive a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n\nwhere `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nDue to time dilation from special relativity, the lifetime in the lab frame is related to the proper lifetime `τ₀` (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n\nThe time `t` it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall of radius `R` is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t ≈ R/c`.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nLet's analyze the two given scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of survivors, `(N/N₀)₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ₀))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ₀)`\n`-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ₀)`\n`ln(3) = (R/c) / (20 * τ₀)`  (Equation 1)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n*   The desired fraction of survivors is `(N/N₀)₂ = 2/3`.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`ln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)`  (Equation 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations. The term `(R/c) / τ₀` is a constant for this particle and detector setup. We can find a relationship between the two scenarios by dividing Equation 1 by Equation 2:\n\n`(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = [ (R/c) / (20 * τ₀) ] / [ (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀) ]`\n\nThe term `(R/c) / τ₀` cancels out:\n`ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n\nNow, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\nUsing the provided calculation:\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
