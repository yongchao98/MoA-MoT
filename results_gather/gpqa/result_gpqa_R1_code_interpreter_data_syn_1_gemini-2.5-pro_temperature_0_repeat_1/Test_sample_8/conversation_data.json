    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C₃h symmetry.\n\n### Analysis of Molecular Symmetry\n\nThe C₃h point group requires two key symmetry elements:\n1.  A principal axis of rotation of order 3 (a C₃ axis), which means the molecule is unchanged after a 120° rotation.\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (a σh plane) that is perpendicular to the C₃ axis.\n\nLet's examine each molecule:\n\n**A) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)₃ or B(OCH(CH₃)₂)₃)**\n\n*   **Structure:** The central boron atom is sp² hybridized and bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar geometry.\n*   **C₃ Axis:** A C₃ axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane formed by the boron and the three oxygen atoms (the BO₃ plane). Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis leaves the BO₃ core unchanged.\n*   **σh Plane:** The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH₃)₂) attached to the oxygens can rotate. A specific, stable conformation exists where the molecule as a whole possesses a horizontal mirror plane. In this conformation, the plane of the BO₃ core, along with the three methine carbons and three methine hydrogens (-O-**C**-**H**), forms the σh plane. For each isopropyl group, one methyl group (-CH₃) lies above this plane, and the other lies below it, as a mirror reflection.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since triisopropyl borate can adopt a stable conformation with both a C₃ axis and a perpendicular σh plane, its point group is **C₃h**.\n\n**B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a complex IUPAC name for a molecule commonly known as **mellitic anhydride** (C₁₂O₉). It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups.\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is planar.\n    *   It has a C₃ axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The molecular plane itself acts as a σh plane.\n    *   Additionally, it has three C₂ axes lying within the plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C₃ axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of the C₂ axes perpendicular to the C₃ axis makes the point group **D₃h**. While a D₃h molecule contains the symmetry elements of C₃h, its overall symmetry is higher. In questions of this type, we identify the molecule whose highest-achievable point group is the one specified.\n\n**C) Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a cage-like bicyclic amine.\n*   **Symmetry:**\n    *   It has a C₃ axis that passes through the bridgehead nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom.\n    *   It has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C₃ axis.\n    *   It does **not** have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Reflecting the top half (near the nitrogen) through a plane perpendicular to the C₃ axis does not produce the bottom half.\n*   **Conclusion:** The point group of quinuclidine is **C₃v**.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure:** Similar to molecule B, this is a complex name for a larger planar anhydride, built upon a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core.\n*   **Symmetry:** Like mellitic anhydride, this molecule is expected to be planar and highly symmetric.\n*   **Conclusion:** By analogy with molecule B, its point group is also **D₃h**, possessing higher symmetry than C₃h.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the point groups of the four molecules:\n*   A) Triisopropyl borate: **C₃h**\n*   B) Mellitic anhydride: D₃h\n*   C) Quinuclidine: C₃v\n*   D) Triphenylene anhydride analogue: D₃h\n\nThe only molecule that belongs to the C₃h point group is triisopropyl borate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
