    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and its observables:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n    The magnitude of this shift is given by the Doppler formula:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the wavelength shift, $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength, $v_r$ is the star's radial velocity, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    The amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, known as the RV semi-amplitude, K.\n    $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts.\n\n2.  **Calculate the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes (K):**\n    For Planet #1, $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom.\n    For Planet #2, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom.\n    The ratio is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Relate the RV semi-amplitude (K) to the physical parameters of the system:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit ($e=0$), the RV semi-amplitude of the star is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    -   $T$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n    -   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    -   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    -   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky).\n    -   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Apply the given conditions to simplify the relationship:**\n    The problem states:\n    -   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    -   The planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\". In RV measurements, the quantity that is actually constrained is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin i$. It is a standard convention in such problems to assume that this measured quantity is what is being referred to as \"the mass\". Therefore, we assume $(m_p \\sin i)_1 = (m_p \\sin i)_2$.\n\n    With these conditions, the terms $(2\\pi G)^{1/3}$, $m_p \\sin i$, and $M_{star}^{2/3}$ are the same for both systems. Thus, they cancel out when we take a ratio, leaving a simple proportionality between K and T:\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Formulate the ratio of periods:**\n    Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can write the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes as:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the period ratio ($T_2/T_1$):**\n    We now have two expressions for the ratio $K_2/K_1$. Let's equate them:\n    $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    To solve for the desired ratio, $T_2/T_1$, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    $1.4^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    $2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    Finally, we take the reciprocal of this result to find $T_2/T_1$:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the final numerical value:**\n    To get the final answer, we perform the division.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes K2/K1 is the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\nK_ratio = 7 / 5\n\n# The relationship between K and T is K ‚àù T^(-1/3), given that the stellar masses and planetary minimum masses (m*sin(i)) are the same.\n# K2/K1 = (T2/T1)^(-1/3)\n# We want to find the period ratio T2/T1.\n# Let period_ratio = T2/T1.\n# K_ratio = period_ratio^(-1/3)\n# K_ratio^3 = period_ratio^(-1)\n# period_ratio = 1 / (K_ratio^3)\n\nperiod_ratio = 1 / (K_ratio**3)\nprint(period_ratio)\n```\n\nThe calculation gives a value of approximately 0.3644. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets, $T_2/T_1$. We are given information from Radial Velocity (RV) measurements.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between observables and physical parameters in the RV method.**\n\nThe RV method measures the periodic Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is related to the star's radial velocity, $v_r$, by the Doppler formula:\n$\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted by $K$. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}}$\n\nGiven:\n$\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom\n$\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nSo, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n**2. Relate the RV semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period (T).**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude of the star is given by:\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\nwhere:\n*   $T$ is the orbital period.\n*   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n*   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe problem states that:\n*   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star, 1} = M_{star, 2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p, 1} \\approx m_{p, 2}$. In the context of RV measurements, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin i$. It is standard to assume this is the quantity being referred to, so we take $(m_p \\sin i)_1 = (m_p \\sin i)_2$.\n\n**3. Formulate the ratio of periods.**\n\nLet's write the ratio of $K_2$ to $K_1$ using the formula:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{(m_p \\sin i)_2}{M_{star, 2}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{(m_p \\sin i)_1}{M_{star, 1}^{2/3}}}$\n\nSince $M_{star, 1} = M_{star, 2}$ and $(m_p \\sin i)_1 = (m_p \\sin i)_2$, these terms cancel out, along with the constant $2\\pi G$. The expression simplifies to:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(1/T_2)^{1/3}}{(1/T_1)^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**4. Solve for the period ratio ($T_2/T_1$).**\n\nWe now have two expressions for the ratio $K_2/K_1$:\n1.  From the wavelength shifts: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$\n2.  From the physical formula: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nEquating these gives:\n$1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nTo solve for the desired ratio, $T_2/T_1$, we first cube both sides:\n$1.4^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n$2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n\nFinally, we take the reciprocal to find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>"
