    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of Compound X from the provided spectral data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n        *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet far downfield is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded by the adjacent electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the protons at 7.2 ppm are adjacent to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's piece together the remaining signals to identify the second substituent on the ring.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is an ethyl group fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment, which is split by both the adjacent methyl group and another proton.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is the methine (-CH-) proton. It is attached to the benzene ring (making it benzylic), the methyl group (doublet at 1.4 ppm), and the ethyl group (triplet at 0.9 ppm and multiplet at 1.7 ppm).\n        *   **Assembling the structure:** The alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n        *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This structure is consistent with all the spectral data.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction and determine the final product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagents:** The combination of red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce a variety of functional groups, most notably the complete reduction of carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group. The benzene ring itself and the *sec*-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n    *   **Product:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: The -COOH at position 1 is converted to -CH₃. The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 remains. The final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (also known as 4-sec-butyltoluene).\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches our predicted product.\n    *   B) **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** This is incorrect. The carboxylic acid group is reduced, not retained.\n    *   C) **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material, Compound X, not the final product.\n    *   D) **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** This is incorrect. The alkyl group is *sec*-butyl, not *isobutyl*, and no rearrangement is expected to occur.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
