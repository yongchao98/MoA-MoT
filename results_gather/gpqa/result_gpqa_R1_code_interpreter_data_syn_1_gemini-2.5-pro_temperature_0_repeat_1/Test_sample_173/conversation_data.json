    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   **Mass Relation:** The more massive fragment ($m_1$) is twice as massive as the lighter one ($m_2$), so $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   **Mass-Energy Conservation:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$. The remaining 1% of the initial rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\nThen, $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$):\n    $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment ($m_2$):\n    $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value is the energy released in the fission, which is converted into the total kinetic energy ($T_1 + T_2$) of the fragments. It's the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n$Q = (\\text{Initial rest-mass energy}) - (\\text{Final rest-mass energy})$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy of the More Massive Fragment ($T_1$) using Classical Mechanics**\n\nIn classical mechanics, for a system decaying from rest, the fragments have equal and opposite momenta ($p_1 = p_2 = p$). The kinetic energy is given by $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n$\\frac{T_{1, \\text{cl}}}{T_{2, \\text{cl}}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, $T_{2, \\text{cl}} = 2T_{1, \\text{cl}}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the sum:\n$Q = T_{1, \\text{cl}} + T_{2, \\text{cl}} = T_{1, \\text{cl}} + 2T_{1, \\text{cl}} = 3T_{1, \\text{cl}}$\nSolving for $T_{1, \\text{cl}}$:\n$T_{1, \\text{cl}} = \\frac{Q}{3} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV}}{3} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\nIn MeV, $T_{1, \\text{cl}} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy of the More Massive Fragment ($T_1$)**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$. The total energy is also $E = T + mc^2$.\nFrom this, we can derive $(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)$.\n\nDue to conservation of momentum, the fragments have equal and opposite momenta, so $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nWe also know $T_1 + T_2 = Q$, so $T_2 = Q - T_1$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2) - 2T_1(m_2c^2)$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms cancel. Rearranging to solve for $T_1$:\n$2T_1(m_1c^2) + 2QT_1 + 2T_1(m_2c^2) = Q^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nSince $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = Mc^2 - Q$:\n$T_1 [2(Mc^2 - Q) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 (2Mc^2) = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2Mc^2}$\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n$T_1 = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV} (3 \\text{ GeV} + 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV})}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV}}$\n$T_1 = \\frac{3 (3 + 198)}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\nIn MeV, $T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value.\nDifference = $T_1 - T_{1, \\text{cl}} = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values in GeV\nMc2 = 300\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# Calculate Q-value (total kinetic energy released)\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation ---\n# T1_cl = Q / 3\nT1_classical = Q / 3\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation ---\n# T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)) / (2 * Mc2)\nT1_relativistic = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * Mc2)\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1 = {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1 = {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference = {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n```\nRelativistic T1 = 1.005 GeV\nClassical T1 = 1.000 GeV\nDifference = 5.0 MeV\n\nThe calculation confirms that the difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define the initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_{initial} = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is $P_{initial} = 0$.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's denote the more massive fragment as $m_1$ and the lighter one as $m_2$. So, $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n\nWe have a system of two equations to find the masses of the fragments in terms of M:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nWe can now find their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments ($T_1 + T_2$).\n$Q = T_1 + T_2 = E_{initial} - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n\nBy the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T_{cl} = p^2 / (2m)$.\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n$\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, $T_{2,cl} = 2T_{1,cl}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the sum:\n$Q = T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3T_{1,cl}$\nSolving for the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment:\n$T_{1,cl} = \\frac{Q}{3} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV}}{3} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1:**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy E, momentum p, and rest-mass m is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$.\nFrom this, we can express the momentum as $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)$.\n\nAgain, conservation of momentum requires $p_1 = p_2$, so $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nWe also know $T_1 + T_2 = Q$, which means $T_2 = Q - T_1$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2) - 2T_1(m_2c^2)$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out. We rearrange the equation to solve for $T_1$:\n$2T_1(m_1c^2) + 2QT_1 + 2T_1(m_2c^2) = Q^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nWe know that $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = Mc^2 - Q$. Substituting this in:\n$T_1 [2(Mc^2 - Q) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2Mc^2] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2Mc^2}$\n\nNow, we plug in the numerical values:\n$T_1 = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV} \\times (3 \\text{ GeV} + 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV})}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV}}$\n$T_1 = \\frac{3 \\times (3 + 198)}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = $T_1 - T_{1,cl} = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
