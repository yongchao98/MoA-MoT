    "This problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This reaction proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D) at position C2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2). This provides the amide ion (:NH2-), which is a very strong base and a good nucleophile.\n*   **Solvent:** Liquid ammonia (NH3). It acts as a solvent and a proton source in the final step.\n*   **Mechanism:** The conditions are classic for an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne. The strong base, NH2-, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton from C6 is significantly faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2.\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion intermediate then loses the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this process. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    Although slower, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 by the strong base is still a possible reaction pathway.\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium atom was removed in this step, the resulting intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile, the amide ion (NH2-), to the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH3).\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate from Path A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The nucleophile NH2- can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields **aniline-2-d** (or 2-deuterioaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields **aniline-3-d** (or 3-deuterioaniline).\n    So, Path A leads to two distinct products.\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate from Path B (Benzyne)**\n    This intermediate is the standard non-deuterated benzyne, with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The amide ion can attack either C1 or C2. Due to the symmetry of the intermediate with respect to the outcome, both attacks lead to the formation of a carbanion which, upon protonation by NH3, yields the same single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    So, Path B leads to one product.\n\n**4. Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition reactions, we can identify all the possible organic products.\n1.  **Aniline-2-d** (from Path A)\n2.  **Aniline-3-d** (from Path A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nThese three products are structurally distinct isomers (isotopomers). Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *possible* products, so even though the products from Path B (aniline) will be formed in a smaller amount than those from Path A, they must be included in the count.\n\nThe final answer is 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
