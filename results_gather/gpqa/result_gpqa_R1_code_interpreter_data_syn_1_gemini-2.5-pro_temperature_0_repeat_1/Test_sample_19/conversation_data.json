    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n**1. Understanding the Impulse Approximation (IA)**\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is to simplify a complex many-body interaction (a probe hitting a nucleus with A nucleons) into a much simpler one. The approximation assumes that the interaction happens with just *one* nucleon inside the nucleus, and that this nucleon behaves as if it were a *free* particle during the very brief moment of interaction.\n\nLet's analyze each of the four statements in this context:\n\n*   **Statement 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    This is a fundamental part of the IA. It assumes that the probe (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) couples to a single nucleon. This is called the \"additivity\" assumption. It explicitly ignores more complex scenarios like the probe interacting with a pair of nucleons simultaneously (these are described by meson-exchange currents). Therefore, this statement is a necessary component of the IA.\n\n*   **Statement 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    This assumption deals with what happens before and after the main interaction. If the incoming probe or the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) can re-scatter off other nucleons, the process is much more complicated. These are called initial-state interactions (ISI) and final-state interactions (FSI). The simplest form of the impulse approximation (the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation, or PWIA) assumes the nucleus is \"transparent\" to these particles, meaning ISI and FSI are ignored. This is crucial for making the interaction look like a clean, free-nucleon event. Therefore, this statement is a necessary component of the IA.\n\n*   **Statement 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, operates at the level of nucleons, treating them as the fundamental degrees of freedom. While the properties of the nucleon (like its form factors) might be calculated using a model of its internal structure (like the constituent quark model, which often uses non-relativistic quarks), this is a separate theoretical step. The IA itself does not depend on this assumption. One can use the IA in a fully relativistic framework where the nucleon's internal structure is also treated relativistically. Therefore, this statement is *not* a defining assumption of the impulse approximation.\n\n*   **Statement 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    This is the \"sudden approximation\" aspect, which is at the very heart of the IA. It posits that the interaction is extremely fast compared to the characteristic time scale of the nuclear forces that bind the nucleon. Because the interaction is so \"sudden,\" the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors, and the binding potential can be ignored *during* the collision. The energy and momentum from the probe are transferred directly to the single nucleon as if it were free. Therefore, this statement is a necessary component of the IA.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe impulse approximation is defined by the assumptions that the interaction targets a single nucleon (1), that this nucleon acts as a free particle unbound by nuclear forces during the event (4), and that there are no complicating side-interactions with the rest of the nucleus (2). Assumption (3) is about a different level of physics (the internal structure of the nucleon) and is not a prerequisite for the IA.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
