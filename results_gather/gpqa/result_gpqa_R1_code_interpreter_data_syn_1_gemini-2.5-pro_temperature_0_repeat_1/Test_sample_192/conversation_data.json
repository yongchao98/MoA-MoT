    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance range (`dN/dr`) and the distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are told that the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. In mathematical terms, this means the number of stars per unit parallax range (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Recall the Fundamental Relationship:** Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely related:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Establish the Connection:** We need to find `dN/dr` starting from `dN/d(plx)`. We can use the chain rule of differentiation to relate these two quantities:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative:** We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance, `d(plx)/dr`.\n    `plx = 1/r = r^(-1)`\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(r^(-1))/dr = -1 * r^(-2) = -1/r^2`\n\n6.  **Apply the Transformation:** When transforming a distribution (like the number of stars), we use the absolute value of the Jacobian (the derivative term). This is because the number of stars in a given shell must be positive, regardless of whether the variables are directly or inversely related.\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    Substituting the terms we know:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * |-1/r^2|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of `r`:** The final relationship should be in terms of distance `r`. We substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression.\n    `1/plx^5 = 1 / (1/r)^5 = r^5`\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute this back into the proportionality for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\n**Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, changes with distance `r` as `r^3`. This corresponds to option B.\n\nAs a check, let's consider the case of a uniform star distribution in space. The number density `n(r)` is constant. The number of stars in a thin shell of radius `r` and thickness `dr` is `dN = n(r) * dV = n(r) * (4πr^2 dr)`. So, `dN/dr ∝ r^2`. This is a common baseline result in astronomy. The problem gives a different initial condition (`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` instead of the `1/plx^4` that corresponds to a uniform distribution), which leads to a different result. Our calculation correctly transforms the given distribution from parallax space to distance space.\n\n<<<B>>>"
