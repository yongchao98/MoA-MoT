    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid - a weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol\n\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid - a strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, so we have 0.08 mol of H+ ions.\n\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide - a strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2).\n\n*   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.08 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.18 mol\n*   H⁺ is the limiting reactant. All 0.08 mol of H⁺ will be consumed, reacting with 0.08 mol of OH⁻.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.10 mol\n*   CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant. All 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH will be consumed, reacting with 0.05 mol of OH⁻.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (acetate) formed = 0.05 mol\n\n**3. Determine the final composition and calculate the pH.**\n\nAfter all reactions, the final solution contains:\n*   0.05 mol of excess OH⁻ (a strong base)\n*   0.05 mol of CH₃COO⁻ (a weak base)\n*   0.08 mol of Cl⁻ (spectator ion)\n*   0.09 mol of Ba²⁺ (spectator ion)\n\nThe pH of the solution will be dominated by the concentration of the excess strong base, OH⁻. The contribution of the weak base CH₃COO⁻ to the hydroxide concentration is negligible in the presence of a much stronger base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   We can use a python script to perform the final calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of excess OH-\nmoles_oh_excess = 0.05\n\n# Total volume in Liters\ntotal_volume = 1.2\n\n# Calculate the concentration of OH-\nconc_oh = moles_oh_excess / total_volume\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_oh)\n\n# Calculate pH\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH=}\")\n```\n>>>\npH=12.619788758288332\n<<<\nThe calculated pH is approximately 12.62. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 8.92\nB) 1.38\nC) 8.68\nD) 12.62\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each acid and base.**\n    *   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n        Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol\n    *   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n        Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n        Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n        Since Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to give two OH⁻ ions (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), the moles of OH⁻ are:\n        Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n2.  **Perform the neutralization reactions.** The strong base (OH⁻) will react with the acids.

The presence of this strong base will dominate the pH of the solution.\n\n    *   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n        Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n    *   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n        [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n        [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n    *   **Calculate the pOH:**\n        pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n        pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n    *   **Calculate the pH:**\n        pH = 14 - pOH\n        pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
