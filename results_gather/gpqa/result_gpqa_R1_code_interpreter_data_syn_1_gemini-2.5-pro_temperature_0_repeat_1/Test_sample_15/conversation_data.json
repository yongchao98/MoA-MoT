    "An optically active compound is a chiral compound that is present in a non-racemic form (i.e., as a single enantiomer or an unequal mixture of enantiomers). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks any improper axis of rotation (which includes planes of symmetry and centers of inversion).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. The atoms around the C=C double bond lie in a single plane. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E), which specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer. The complex and asymmetric structure of the molecule's carbon framework, along with the `8-(chloromethylene)` substituent, ensures that the molecule lacks internal symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Since a specific single stereoisomer (an enantiomer or a diastereomer) is named, it is not a racemic mixture. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, as the groups attached to C2 are the same as those attached to C3. The (2R,3S) stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry that passes between C2 and C3 (in an eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (in a staggered conformation). A compound with chiral centers that is achiral overall due to internal symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair. They are chiral because they lack any internal symmetry elements and are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. The name specifies the (2R,3R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom bearing the -OH group (C1) is a chiral center because the two paths around the ring from this carbon are different (`-CH2-CH=CH-` vs. `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: For the carbons C1, C3, and C5 to be stereocenters that can be assigned a configuration (like 's' or 'r'), the molecule must be chiral. If the molecule were the all-cis isomer (where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring), it would be achiral (meso) due to a plane of symmetry. In such a symmetric molecule, C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not true chiral centers. Therefore, the name `(1s,3s,5s)` must refer to a chiral isomer, such as one where two -OH groups are cis and one is trans (e.g., up, up, down). Such an isomer is chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral compound. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups (`-CH3` and the terminal `CH3` of the chain), and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n\nThere are a total of 4 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
