    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position, with an (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction is followed by an acidic workup to protonate the resulting alkoxide.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion (H-) on the two faces of the carbonyl group is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (the mirror image of (3R, 5S) is (3S, 5R)). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    *   Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product has two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, we must consider all possible stereoisomers. The molecule is symmetric around the C3 carbon.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the C3 atom and is therefore an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, so they will have different retention times and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The three products consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical polarities and will not be separated, eluting together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has a different polarity, and will be separated, giving a second, distinct **1 peak**. Thus, the products of Reaction II will show **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Combined:** The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different polarities. Therefore, it is assumed that none of the peaks from Reaction I will accidentally overlap with peaks from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of all different stereoisomers, including **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomeric products will be separated, resulting in **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The three stereoisomeric products will all be separated from each other. The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into **2 separate peaks**. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique retention time, giving **1 peak**. Thus, the products of Reaction II will show **3 peaks**.\n    *   **Combined:** Again, assuming no accidental overlap between the products of the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 3 peaks (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
