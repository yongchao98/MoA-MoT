    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Part 1: Thermodynamic Strength of Oxygen as an Oxidant\n\n1.  **Definition**: The thermodynamic strength of an oxidant is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A substance with a higher (more positive) E° is a stronger oxidant because it has a greater tendency to be reduced.\n2.  **Reaction in Acidic Solution**: The reduction of oxygen in an acidic solution is given by the half-reaction:\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +1.23 V.\n3.  **Reaction in Basic Solution**: The reduction of oxygen in a basic solution is given by the half-reaction:\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +0.40 V.\n4.  **Comparison**: We compare the standard reduction potentials in the two environments:\n    E° (acidic) = +1.23 V\n    E° (basic) = +0.40 V\n    Since +0.40 V < +1.23 V, oxygen has a lower tendency to be reduced in a basic solution compared to an acidic solution.\n5.  **Conclusion for the first blank**: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n### Part 2: Kinetic Rate of Oxygen Reaction\n\n1.  **The Nature of the Reaction**: The reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) to water (H₂O) is a complex process. It involves the transfer of four electrons and the breaking of a very strong O=O double bond (bond dissociation energy ≈ 498 kJ/mol).\n2.  **Activation Energy**: Processes that involve multiple electron transfers and the breaking of strong covalent bonds typically have a high activation energy. This means that even if the reaction is thermodynamically favorable (as indicated by the positive E°), it proceeds very slowly.\n3.  **Kinetic Hindrance**: In electrochemistry, the oxygen reduction reaction is famously \"kinetically sluggish\" or \"slow\". This phenomenon is responsible for the high \"overpotential\" required to make the reaction happen at a significant rate in applications like fuel cells and metal corrosion.\n4.  **Conclusion for the second blank**: The statement \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions\" refers to this inherent slowness. Despite being a strong oxidant thermodynamically, its reaction rate is slow. Therefore, the correct term is **slower**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   The first blank should be **weaker**.\n*   The second blank should be **slower**.\n\nThis corresponds to the combination **weaker - slower**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
