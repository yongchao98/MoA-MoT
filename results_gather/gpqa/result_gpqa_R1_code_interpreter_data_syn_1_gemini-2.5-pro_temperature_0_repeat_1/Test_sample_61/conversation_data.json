    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Product**\n\n*   **Name:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\n*   **Structure Breakdown:**\n    *   **Parent:** `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde (-CHO) group attached.\n    *   **Substituent:** `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`. This group is -CH(OH)-Cyclohexyl.\n    *   **Position:** `1-`. The substituent is attached to carbon-1 of the parent cyclohexane ring, which is the same carbon that bears the -CHO group.\n*   **Drawing the Structure:**\n    Let's denote the parent ring as Ring A and the substituent's ring as Ring B.\n    The structure is a quaternary carbon on Ring A (C1) bonded to:\n    1.  The rest of Ring A (C2 and C6).\n    2.  The carbaldehyde group (-CHO).\n    3.  The substituent group (-CH(OH)-C6H11), where C6H11 is Ring B.\n    This structure has 14 carbon atoms (6 in Ring A + 1 CHO + 1 bridge C + 6 in Ring B).\n\n*   **Retrosynthetic Analysis:**\n    The target molecule is a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure `(Ring B)-CH(OH)-C(CHO)-(Ring A)` is characteristic of an **aldol addition product**. Specifically, it results from the self-condensation of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C6H11-CHO).\n    *   **Nucleophile (Enolate):** One molecule of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde loses its alpha-proton (the H on the carbon attached to the -CHO group) to form an enolate.\n    *   **Electrophile:** The enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Reaction:** 2 x (C6H11-CHO) --(Base)--> (C6H11)-CH(OH)-C(CHO)-(C6H10 ring system)\n    This confirms the final step of the synthesis must be a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe overall goal is to synthesize cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, and then perform the aldol reaction.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH)\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   Step 1 is chemically flawed. NaNH2 is a very strong base that would be immediately neutralized by the acidic proton of methanol (CH3OH). It would not effectively deprotonate the alkyne. This sequence is incorrect from the start.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   Step 1: C6H11-C≡CH + NaNH2 + CH3CH2Cl → C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3 (1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne).\n    *   Step 2: Reduction of the alkyne with Li/NH3 gives the *trans*-alkene, (E)-1-cyclohexylbut-1-ene.\n    *   Step 3: Oxidative ozonolysis (O3/H2O) cleaves the double bond to form carboxylic acids. The products would be cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (C6H11-COOH) and propanoic acid (CH3CH2-COOH).\n    *   This sequence produces carboxylic acids, not the required aldehyde precursor.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Step 1:** Alkylation of the terminal alkyne.\n        C6H11-C≡CH + NaNH2 + CH3Cl → C6H11-C≡C-CH3 (1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne).\n    *   **Step 2:** Lindlar's catalyst (H2/Pd-CaCO3) reduces the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n        C6H11-C≡C-CH3 → (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene. (Note: the stereochemistry does not affect the final ozonolysis products).\n    *   **Step 3:** Reductive ozonolysis (O3/(CH3)2S) cleaves the double bond to form aldehydes.\n        (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene → C6H11-CHO (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) + CH3CHO (acetaldehyde).\n        This step successfully produces the required precursor, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 4:** Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, which is a suitable catalyst for an aldol condensation. It will catalyze the self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the target product. While a mixture of aldol products would form in reality (due to the presence of acetaldehyde), this sequence provides the necessary precursor and the correct reagent for the final transformation.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   This sequence has confusing numbering. Let's assume a logical order.\n    *   If Step 2 is H2/Pd (catalytic hydrogenation), it will reduce the alkyne from Step 1 all the way to an alkane.\n        C6H11-C≡C-CH3 → C6H11-CH2CH2CH3 (propylcyclohexane). Subsequent reagents will not react with the alkane to form the target.\n    *   If Step 2 is the hydration reaction (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O), it performs Markovnikov hydration of the alkyne from Step 1.\n        C6H11-C≡C-CH3 → C6H11-C(=O)-CH2CH3 (a ketone). This does not produce the required aldehyde.\n    *   This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSequence C is the only chemically sound pathway that produces cyclohexanecarbaldehyde as an intermediate and then uses an appropriate reagent (Ba(OH)2) to catalyze the self-aldol addition to form the final target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<C>>>"
