    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOCH₃)₂). In the presence of a base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to form an intermediate enolate.\n    3.  This enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final product.\n*   **Product Structure (A):**\n    The new bond forms between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`\n*   **Product Name:**\n    To name this molecule, we can identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups (the esters).\n    Let's number the chain as follows:\n    `MeOOC-CH₂(3)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH(1)(COOMe)₂`\n    *   The parent chain is propane.\n    *   There are three methyl ester groups (trimethyl ... tricarboxylate). They are at positions 1, 1, and 3. So, it's a `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    *   There is a p-tolyl group at position 2.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name for product A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophilic enol equivalent. It is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n*   **Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    1.  The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. The nucleophilic carbon is the one β to the nitrogen atom.\n    2.  This forms an intermediate containing an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    3.  The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) has two effects: it protonates the carbanion and hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone.\n*   **Product Structure (B):**\n    The reaction results in the alkylation of cyclohexanone at the α-position. The group added is derived from the but-2-enenitrile.\n    The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n*   **Product Name:**\n    The major product is the keto form, not the enol.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (CN).\n    *   The parent chain is butanenitrile.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain. The substituent is named `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name for product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Reactant C:** We need to identify the Michael donor.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:**\n    The product is formed by a Michael addition. We can identify the two components by cleaving the newly formed C-C bond.\n    *   The product has a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` core and a `(3-oxobutyl)` side chain (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`) at position 2.\n    *   The side chain corresponds to the Michael acceptor, MVK, after it has been attacked at its β-carbon (`CH₂=`).\n    *   This means the Michael donor must be the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic proton at C-2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione (the methylene group between two carbonyls).\n    2.  The resulting enolate attacks the β-carbon of MVK.\n    3.  Protonation of the resulting intermediate enolate by water gives the final product.\n*   **Reactant C:**\n    Based on the retrosynthesis, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect A, Incorrect B, Correct C\n*   B) Correct A, Correct B, Correct C\n*   C) Correct A, Correct B, Incorrect C\n*   D) Incorrect A, Incorrect B, Incorrect C\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
