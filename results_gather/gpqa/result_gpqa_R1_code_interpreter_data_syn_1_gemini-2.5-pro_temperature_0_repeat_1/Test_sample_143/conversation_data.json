    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the mean decay distance (also known as the mean decay length) of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information**\n- Production energy of X: $E_{X}=8$ GeV\n- Mass of X: $m_{X}=1.2$ GeV\n- Decay width of X: $\\Gamma_{X}=320$ MeV\n\n**3. Recall the Relevant Physics Principles**\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle is the average distance it travels before decaying. In the laboratory frame, this is given by the formula:\n$L = v \\cdot t_{lab}$\nwhere $v$ is the particle's velocity and $t_{lab}$ is its mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nDue to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$) is longer than the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau$) by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor):\n$t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\nThe particle's velocity is $v = \\beta c$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\beta$ is the velocity as a fraction of $c$.\nSo, the formula for the mean decay distance becomes:\n$L = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$\n\nThe proper mean lifetime ($\\tau$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n$\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nSubstituting $\\tau$ into the equation for $L$, we get:\n$L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Relativistic Factors ($\\gamma$ and $\\beta$)**\nThe Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$\nIn particle physics units where $c=1$, this simplifies to:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X} = \\frac{8 \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.667$\n\nThe factor $\\beta$ is related to $\\gamma$ by:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\nHowever, it's often more convenient to use the relativistic momentum ($p$). The product $\\gamma \\beta$ can be expressed as:\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{p c}{m_X c^2}$\nwhere the momentum $p$ is found from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n$pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n\nLet's calculate $pc$:\n$pc = \\sqrt{(8 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\text{ GeV})^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 1.44} \\text{ GeV} = \\sqrt{62.56} \\text{ GeV}$\n\nNow we can express the mean decay distance formula as:\n$L = \\left(\\frac{pc}{m_X c^2}\\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n**5. Perform the Final Calculation**\nWe need to plug in the values. It's important to use consistent units. Let's use GeV for energy.\n- $pc = \\sqrt{62.56}$ GeV\n- $m_X c^2 = 1.2$ GeV\n- $\\Gamma_X = 320$ MeV = $0.320$ GeV\n- The value of the physical constant $\\hbar c$ is approximately $197.327$ MeV路fm, which is $0.197327$ GeV路fm. (1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m).\n\n$L = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{62.56} \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.197327 \\text{ GeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{0.320 \\text{ GeV}}\\right)$\n$L = \\left(\\frac{7.909488...}{1.2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.197327}{0.320}\\right) \\text{ fm}$\n$L = (6.59124...) \\times (0.616647...) \\text{ fm}$\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n\nSince 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m, the mean decay distance is:\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values in GeV\nE_X = 8.0\nm_X = 1.2\nGamma_X = 0.320 # 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV\n\n# Constant hbar*c in GeV*fm.

    "The user has provided a code output that differs slightly from the one I generated initially, but confirms the overall result. Let's review the process.\n\n**1. Recap of the Physics and Formula**\n\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle in the laboratory frame is given by the product of its velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$).\n$L = v \\cdot t_{lab}$\n\nDue to time dilation, the lab-frame lifetime is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau$) by the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\nThe proper lifetime $\\tau$ is related to the decay width $\\Gamma$ by the uncertainty principle:\n$\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nCombining these, and using $v = \\beta c$, we get:\n$L = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\nThe term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be expressed in terms of the particle's energy ($E$) and mass ($m$). From the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$ and the definition of relativistic momentum $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$, we can write:\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{p}{m} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $L$:\n$L = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n**2. Plugging in the Values**\n\nWe are given:\n*   $E_X = 8$ GeV\n*   $m_X = 1.2$ GeV (Note: this is shorthand for $m_X c^2 = 1.2$ GeV)\n*   $\\Gamma_X = 320$ MeV = $0.320$ GeV\n*   The physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327$ MeV路fm = $0.197327$ GeV路fm. (1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m)\n\nNow, we calculate the terms:\n*   The momentum term in the numerator: $\\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2} = \\sqrt{(8 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\text{ GeV})^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 1.44} \\text{ GeV} = \\sqrt{62.56}$ GeV.\n*   The ratio involving energy and mass: $\\frac{\\sqrt{62.56} \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 6.59124$\n*   The ratio involving the decay width: $\\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{0.197327 \\text{ GeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{0.320 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 0.616647$ fm\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\n$L = (6.59124) \\times (0.616647 \\text{ fm}) \\approx 4.0645$ fm\n\nSince 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m, the mean decay distance is:\n$L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n\nThis result is confirmed by the python code execution provided by the user (`4.0645e-15`).\n\n**4. Comparing with Options**\n\n*   A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n*   B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n*   C) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n*   D) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n\nOur calculated value is $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m. Option B, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m, is the closest match. The small difference of about 0.02% is likely due to rounding or the use of a slightly different value for the constant $\\hbar c$ when the problem and options were created. Given the choices, B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
