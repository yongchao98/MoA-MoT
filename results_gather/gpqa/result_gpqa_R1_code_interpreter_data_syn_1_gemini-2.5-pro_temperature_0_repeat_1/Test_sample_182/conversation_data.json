    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula.\n    *   **Parent structure:** `cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid`. This is a six-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 and a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n    *   **Substituents:**\n        *   A `formyl` group (-CHO) at position 2.\n        *   A `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\n    Let's count the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):**\n        *   6 carbons in the cyclohexane ring.\n        *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n        *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):**\n        *   On the ring: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H₂) -> 7 hydrogens.\n        *   In the substituents: -COOH (1 H), -CHO (1 H), -CH=CH₂ (3 H) -> 5 hydrogens.\n        *   Total Hydrogens = 7 + 5 = 12.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):**\n        *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group.\n        *   1 oxygen in the formyl group.\n        *   Total Oxygens = 2 + 1 = 3.\n    The molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n3.  **Understand the Reaction:**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effect on the functional groups present in the reactant is as follows:\n    *   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C) through hydrogenation.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product:**\n    Applying the reductions to our reactant:\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n    *   The `-COOH` group at C1 becomes a `-CH₃` group.\n    *   The `-CHO` group at C2 becomes a `-CH₃` group.\n    *   The `-CH=CH₂` group at C5 becomes an ethyl group (`-CH₂-CH₃`).\n    The resulting product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n    Now, let's find the molecular formula of this product:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (in the ring) + 1 (first methyl) + 1 (second methyl) + 2 (ethyl) = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** The product is a substituted cycloalkane. The general formula for cycloalkanes is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, for a C₁₀ cycloalkane, the formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using the formula:\n    IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    Where C is the number of carbon atoms and H is the number of hydrogen atoms. (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n\n    For the product with the formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n    Alternatively, the IHD can be determined from the structure of the product. The IHD represents the sum of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, we can use a simple Python script.\n```python\n# Molecular formula of the product is C10H20\nC = 10\nH = 20\n\n# IHD formula: C + 1 - H/2\nihd = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n\nprint(int(ihd))\n```\n>>>\n1\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to determine its carbon skeleton and functional groups.\n    *   **Carbon Skeleton:** It has a six-membered ring (`cyclohex`), two carbons in the vinyl group, one carbon in the formyl group, and one carbon in the carboxylic acid group. Total carbons = 6 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Functional Groups and Unsaturation:**\n        *   A ring structure (contributes 1 to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency, IHD).\n        *   A C=C double bond within the ring (`-3-ene`).\n        *   A C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\n        *   A C=O double bond in the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   A C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n2.  **Understand the Reaction:**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its primary function is to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It removes all oxygen atoms from the molecule.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product:**\n    Applying the effects of Red P + HI to the starting material:\n    *   The carbon skeleton of 10 carbon atoms remains unchanged.\n    *   All double bonds (both C=C and C=O) are reduced to single bonds.\n    *   All oxygen atoms are removed.\n    *   The original ring structure remains.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction converts the complex starting molecule into a simple, saturated cycloalkane with the same number of carbon atoms. The product is a substituted cyclohexane with a 10-carbon framework.\n\n    Since the product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cyclohexane) with 10 carbon atoms, its general formula will be CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula or by inspecting the structure.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Using the Molecular Formula**\n        The formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is:\n        IHD = x - (y/2) + 1\n        For our product, C₁₀H₂₀:\n        IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n        IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n        IHD = 1\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the Structure**\n        The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n        IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n        Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n        Number of pi bonds = 0 (the molecule is fully saturated by the reaction)\n        IHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a simple Python script.\n```python\n# The molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n# We need to calculate its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n# The formula for IHD is: C - H/2 + 1, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\nnum_carbons = 10\nnum_hydrogens = 20\n\nihd = num_carbons - (num_hydrogens / 2) + 1\n\nprint(int(ihd))\n```\n>>>\n1\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant and its Structure:**\n    The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to identify its key features:\n    *   **`cyclohex-3-ene`**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). A ring structure itself counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **`carboxylic acid` (-COOH)**: This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   **`formyl` (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   **`vinyl` (-CH=CH₂)**: This group contains another carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n2.  **Understand the Reagent and Reaction:**\n    The reagent used is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effect is to reduce almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It does not break open stable cycloalkane rings.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    We apply the reducing action of Red P + HI to each part of the starting molecule:\n    *   The C=C bond in the `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the ring to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The C=C bond in the `vinyl` group is reduced, converting it to an `ethyl` group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n\n    The final product is a fully saturated molecule containing a cyclohexane ring with various alkyl substituents. All the original double bonds (both C=C and C=O) have been removed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Rings:** The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings is 1.\n    *   **Pi Bonds:** The reaction with Red P + HI reduces all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the product has zero pi bonds.\n\n    IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n    IHD of the product = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product. The carbon skeleton is preserved.\n    *   Carbons in reactant: 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n    *   The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane) with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for such a compound is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   So, the product's formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n    *   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe code execution from the previous step confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
