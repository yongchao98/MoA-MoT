    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is an adamantane molecule with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions (C1 and C3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at 240°C.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reaction performed under harsh basic and thermal conditions on a tertiary alkyl halide. While substitution to a diol or elimination might be considered, the spectral data for Product 1 provides crucial clues.\n    *   **IR spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone. This rules out a diol product.\n    *   **¹H NMR spectrum:** The provided NMR data (4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H)) is unusual and does not perfectly match common adamantane derivatives. However, the formation of a ketone is strongly supported by the IR data and known chemistry.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base is known to cause a skeletal rearrangement. The established product of this reaction is **4-protoadamantanone** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). This structure is a C₁₀H₁₄O ketone, consistent with the starting material and the IR data. We will proceed assuming Product 1 is 4-protoadamantanone, treating the provided NMR data as potentially misleading or for a different isomer not relevant to the main reaction path.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (4-protoadamantanone).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃) with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** The subsequent reaction step is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This means Product 2 must be an alkene. The transformation from a ketone (Product 1) to an alkene (Product 2) using Al(O-iPr)₃ can be understood as a two-step sequence in one pot:\n    1.  **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) Reduction:** The ketone is reduced by aluminum isopropoxide to the corresponding alcohol. 4-protoadamantanone is reduced to **4-protoadamantanol**.\n    2.  **Dehydration:** The resulting alcohol is dehydrated upon heating, likely catalyzed by the Lewis acidic aluminum species. Dehydration of 4-protoadamantanol can form a double bond between C4 and C5.\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting alkene is **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). This is a disubstituted alkene within the protoadamantane framework.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3 and analyze its ¹H NMR spectrum**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene).\n*   **Reagents:** Ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction. The C=C double bond is cleaved, and each carbon atom of the original double bond becomes a carbonyl group. Since Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is a disubstituted alkene (R-CH=CH-R'), the ozonolysis will yield two aldehyde groups.\n    *   Cleaving the C4=C5 bond in the protoadamantane skeleton opens one of the rings. The remaining core is a **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane** system.\n    *   The two new aldehyde groups (-CHO) are attached to the positions that were connected to the double bond, which correspond to positions 3 and 7 of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n**¹H NMR Analysis of Product 3:**\n\n1.  **Identify the most deshielded hydrogen atom:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde, the most deshielded protons are the two aldehyde protons (-CHO). They typically appear at δ 9-10 ppm. The question excludes protons that exchange with D₂O (like -OH or -NH), which does not apply to aldehyde protons.\n\n2.  **Determine the coupling of the aldehyde proton:** Each aldehyde proton is attached to a carbon (C3 or C7) that has one proton on it (a methine or CH group). Therefore, the aldehyde proton signal would be split into a **doublet**. However, \"doublet\" is not among the given options (A, B, C, D).\n\n3.  **Re-evaluate the question:** This discrepancy suggests that the question is not asking about the aldehyde proton, but rather the **most deshielded proton on the aliphatic skeleton**. These would be the protons at C3 and C7 (H3 and H7), which are alpha to the electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups. Their chemical shift would be around δ 2.5-3.0 ppm.\n\n4.  **Determine the coupling pattern of H3/H7:**\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system in Product 3 adopts a stable dual-chair conformation. The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry, making H3 and H7 chemically equivalent.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the bulky aldehyde groups (-CHO) will occupy the equatorial positions on the cyclohexane-like chairs.\n    *   This forces the protons H3 and H7 into the axial positions.\n    *   An axial proton (e.g., H3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent methylene groups (C2 and C4). It has four vicinal neighbors: two axial protons (H2ax, H4ax) and two equatorial protons (H2eq, H4eq).\n    *   Due to the C₂ symmetry, the two axial neighbors are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial neighbors are equivalent to each other.\n    *   The coupling constant between axial protons (J_ax,ax) is large (~10-13 Hz).\n    *   The coupling constant between axial and equatorial protons (J_ax,eq) is small (~2-5 Hz).\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H3 is split by two equivalent protons with a large coupling constant (giving a triplet) and also by two other equivalent protons with a small coupling constant (which splits each line of the first triplet into another triplet).\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets (tt)**.\n\nThis pattern matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
