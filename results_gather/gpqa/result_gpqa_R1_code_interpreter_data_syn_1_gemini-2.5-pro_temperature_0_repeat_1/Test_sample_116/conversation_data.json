    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from other structural features, such as a chiral axis (in atropisomers and allenes) or a chiral plane. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not be optically active.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   Rotation around this central C-C bond is severely restricted due to the presence of bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The substituents are nitro groups (-NO2) and methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   This restricted rotation, known as steric hindrance, forces the two phenyl rings to be in different planes (non-coplanar).\n    *   This arrangement creates a chiral axis along the biphenyl bond. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   As a result, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, a type of axial chirality.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since this carbon is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule does not contain any chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, a plane of symmetry can pass through the C=O bond, bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, it has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\n<<<D>>>"
