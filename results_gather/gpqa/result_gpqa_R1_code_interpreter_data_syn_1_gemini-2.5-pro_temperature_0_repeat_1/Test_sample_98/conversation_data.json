    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The most crucial pieces of information are the complex splitting patterns observed for two different signals:\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nTo understand these patterns, we use the n+1 rule, where a proton signal is split into n+1 peaks by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons. For complex splitting, a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n\n*   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighbors:\n    *   One proton (1H), causing a doublet (d).\n    *   Two protons (2H), causing a triplet (t).\n    *   Three protons (3H), causing a quartet (q).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with a set of neighbors of {1H, 2H, 3H}.\n\n*   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** means a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighbors:\n    *   One proton (1H), causing a doublet (d).\n    *   Two protons (2H), causing a triplet (t).\n    *   Another group of two protons (2H), causing another triplet (t).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with a set of neighbors of {1H, 2H, 2H}.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nWe need to find the single structure that contains *both* a proton environment matching the `dtq` pattern and another proton environment matching the `dtt` pattern. Let's analyze the methine protons (CH) in each structure, as they are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   `...-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH₂(f)-...`: The proton H(d) is coupled to H(b) (1H), CH₃ (3H), and CH₂ (2H). This gives a `dtq`.\n    *   No proton in this molecule is coupled to {1H, 2H, 2H}. So, this molecule does not have a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   `...-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH(d)-...`: The proton H(c) is coupled to H(d) (1H), CH₂(b) (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). This gives a `dtt`.\n    *   No proton in this molecule is coupled to {1H, 2H, 3H}. So, this molecule does not have a `dtq` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   `...-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(d)-...`: The proton H(c) is coupled to H(d) (1H), CH₂(b) (2H), and its methyl group (3H). This gives a `dtq`.\n    *   No proton in this molecule is coupled to {1H, 2H, 2H}. So, this molecule does not have a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    Let's draw this structure and label the key protons:\n    ```\n          CH₂(g)-CH₃(h)\n          |\n    CH₃(a)-CH(b)-CH(c)-CH₂(d)-COOH\n                 |\n                 CH₂(e)-CH₃(f)\n    ```\n    Now, let's analyze the two methine protons, H(b) and H(c):\n    *   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to its neighbors:\n        *   The proton on the adjacent chiral center, H(b) (1H).\n        *   The two protons on the adjacent methylene group, H(d) (2H).\n        *   The two protons on the methylene group of its ethyl branch, H(e) (2H).\n        *   The set of neighbors is {1H, 2H, 2H}. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals.\n\n    *   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to its neighbors:\n        *   The proton on the adjacent chiral center, H(c) (1H).\n        *   The two protons on the methylene group of its ethyl branch, H(g) (2H).\n        *   The three protons on the adjacent methyl group, H(a) (3H).\n        *   The set of neighbors is {1H, 2H, 3H}. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStructure D, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only compound that has both a proton environment that gives a `dtt` signal and another that gives a `dtq` signal. This matches the provided ¹H NMR data perfectly.\n\nTo be certain, a systematic check can be performed.\n```python\ndef analyze_structure_d():\n    # Structure D: 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid\n    # CH3(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH2(d)-COOH\n    # Let's analyze the methine protons H(b) and H(c)\n    \n    # Proton H(c) is on C3.
