    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State (Dilution)**\n\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   We dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The initial concentration of acetic acid is M₁ = 0.05 M, and the initial volume is V₁ = 20.00 cm³.\n*   The final volume after dilution is V₂ = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   We need to find the new concentration (M₂) of the acetic acid solution that will be titrated. We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n*   M₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n*   So, we are titrating a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Understand the Titration Reaction**\n\n*   The titration is between a weak acid (acetic acid, CH₃COOH) and a strong base (sodium hydroxide, NaOH).\n*   The balanced chemical equation is: CH₃COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) → CH₃COONa(aq) + H₂O(l)\n*   The reaction occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n**3. Calculate the Volume of NaOH to Reach the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, the moles of acid equal the moles of base.\n*   Moles of acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L * 0.0400 L = 0.001 moles. (Note: 40.00 cm³ = 40.00 mL = 0.0400 L)\n*   Moles of base needed = 0.001 moles.\n*   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 mL.\n*   So, 10.00 mL of 0.1 M NaOH is required to reach the equivalence point.\n\n**4. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   25% titration means we have added 25% of the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n*   Volume of NaOH added = 0.25 * 10.00 mL = 2.50 mL.\n*   At this stage, some of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), creating a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n*   First, calculate pKa: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵).\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains.\n*   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is therefore 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) - log(3).\n*   Let's calculate this value.\n\n**5. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 moles) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the acid plus the volume of NaOH added: V_total = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.0500 L.\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻] is: Moles / Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water: CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq).\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We can find it using the relationship Kw = Ka * Kb, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C.\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵).\n*   We set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction to find the [OH⁻] at equilibrium.\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / [CH₃COO⁻]_initial\n*   [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * [CH₃COO⁻]) = sqrt( ( (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ) * 0.02 ).\n*   Once we find [OH⁻], we can calculate pOH = -log([OH⁻]).\n*   Finally, we find the pH using pH = 14 - pOH.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's perform these calculations using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants and Initial Values ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nC_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nV_acid_initial = 20.00 # cm3\nV_water = 20.00 # cm3\nC_base = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution ---\nV_acid_diluted = V_acid_initial + V_water\nC_acid_diluted = (C_acid_initial * V_acid_initial) / V_acid_diluted\n\n# --- Step 2 & 3: Equivalence Point Volume ---\nmoles_acid = C_acid_diluted * (V_acid_diluted / 1000) # in moles\nV_eq_L = moles_acid / C_base # in Liters\nV_eq_mL = V_eq_L * 1000 # in mL\n\n# --- Step 4: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25 = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Step 5: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# All acid is converted to conjugate base A-\nmoles_A_minus = moles_acid\nV_total_eq_L = (V_acid_diluted + V_eq_mL) / 1000\nC_A_minus = moles_A_minus / V_total_eq_L\n\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from the hydrolysis of A-\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-], so [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * C_A_minus)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\n# --- Print Results ---\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = 4.26\n*   pH at equivalence point = 8.52\n\nThese results match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Initial Dilution**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water. We can use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, where:\n*   M₁ = Initial concentration = 0.05 M\n*   V₁ = Initial volume = 20.00 cm³\n*   V₂ = Final volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   M₂ = Final concentration = ?\n\nM₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n\nSo, we are titrating a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Equivalence Point**\n\nThe titration reaction is between a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and a strong base (NaOH):\nCH₃COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) → CH₃COONa(aq) + H₂O(l)\n\nThe reaction is a 1:1 molar ratio. At the equivalence point, the moles of acid equal the moles of base.\n\n*   **Moles of acetic acid:**\n    *   Volume = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L * 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence:**\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol\n    *   Concentration of NaOH = 0.1 M\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³ (or 10.00 mL).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate pH at 25% Titration**\n\n25% titration means we have added 25% of the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. This corresponds to neutralizing 25% of the initial acetic acid.\n\n*   At this point, 25% of the CH₃COOH has been converted to its conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻, and 75% of the CH₃COOH remains.\n*   This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n    pH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH])\n\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n\n*   The ratio of the concentrations [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] is equal to the ratio of their moles, which is 25/75 or 1/3.\n    pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)\n\n**Step 4: Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (0.001 mol of CH₃COO⁻).\n\n*   **Total volume of the solution:**\n    *   V_total = Initial volume of acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   V_total = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n\n*   **Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate, CH₃COO⁻):**\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We can find it from Ka using the ion product of water, Kw (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C):\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n\n*   We can set up an equilibrium expression to find the [OH⁻]:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    Let x = [OH⁻] at equilibrium. Then [CH₃COOH] = x and [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ 0.02 M.\n    Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x = [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * 0.02)\n\n*   Once we find [OH⁻], we can calculate pOH = -log([OH⁻]) and then find the pH using pH = 14.00 - pOH.\n\nTo get the precise numerical values, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants and Initial Values ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nC_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nV_acid_initial = 20.00 # cm3\nV_water = 20.00 # cm3\nC_base = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution ---\nV_acid_diluted = V_acid_initial + V_water\nC_acid_diluted = (C_acid_initial * V_acid_initial) / V_acid_diluted\n\n# --- Step 2 & 3: Equivalence Point Volume ---\nmoles_acid = C_acid_diluted * (V_acid_diluted / 1000) # in moles\nV_eq_L = moles_acid / C_base # in Liters\nV_eq_mL = V_eq_L * 1000 # in mL\n\n# --- Step 4: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25 = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Step 5: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# All acid is converted to conjugate base A-\nmoles_A_minus = moles_acid\nV_total_eq_L = (V_acid_diluted + V_eq_mL) / 1000\nC_A_minus = moles_A_minus / V_total_eq_L\n\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from the hydrolysis of A-\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-], so [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * C_A_minus)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\n# --- Print Results ---\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\nBased on the calculations:\n*   The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThese values correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
