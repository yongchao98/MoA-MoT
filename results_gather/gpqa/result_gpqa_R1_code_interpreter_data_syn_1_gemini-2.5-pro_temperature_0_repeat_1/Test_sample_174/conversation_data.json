    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physical System:** The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with a symmetry axis along the z-axis. This system is radiating electromagnetic waves. The simplest and most dominant form of radiation from a compact oscillating charge distribution is electric dipole radiation. The specified symmetry (spheroid along the z-axis) suggests that the net electric dipole moment is oscillating along this z-axis. Let's model the source as an oscillating electric dipole `p(t) = p₀ cos(ωt) * ẑ`, where `ẑ` is the unit vector along the z-axis.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Electric Dipole Radiation:** For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) in the radiation zone (far field) is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment (`p₀`) and the angular frequency of oscillation (`ω`), but not on the angle `θ`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Angular Dependence and Maximum Power (A):**\n    *   The function `f` mentioned in the problem is this power per unit solid angle: `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`.\n    *   The angular dependence is entirely contained in the `sin²(θ)` term.\n    *   The power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the xy-plane, perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    *   The problem states that this maximum radiated power per unit solid angle is `A`.\n    *   So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * (1)² = C`.\n    *   This means we can replace the constant `C` with `A`, giving the radiation pattern as: `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Fraction of Power at θ = 30°:**\n    *   We need to find the power radiated at `θ = 30°` and express it as a fraction of the maximum power `A`.\n    *   Using the formula from the previous step: `f(λ, 30°) = A * sin²(30°)`.\n    *   The value of `sin(30°)` is a standard trigonometric value: `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    *   The power at `30°` is `f(λ, 30°) = A * (1/4)`.\n    *   The fraction of `A` radiated at this angle is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n    To be absolutely sure of the calculation, we can use a simple python script.\n    ```python\n    import math\n    \n    # Angle in degrees\n    theta_degrees = 30\n    \n    # Convert angle to radians for the math library\n    theta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n    \n    # Calculate sin^2(theta)\n    fraction = math.sin(theta_radians)**2\n    \n    print(f\"The fraction of maximum power at {theta_degrees} degrees is {fraction}\")\n    ```\n    \n    The code will confirm that the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4.\n\n5.  **Determine the Wavelength (λ) Dependence:**\n    *   Now we need to find the form of `f` as a function of `λ`. This requires looking at the full expression for the constant `C` (which is equal to `A`).\n    *   The complete formula for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle is:\n        `dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² c) * sin²(θ)`\n    *   Here, `ω` is the angular frequency. It is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by the formula `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`.\n    *   The power `dP/dΩ` is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n    *   Substituting the expression for `ω` in terms of `λ`:\n        `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴ = (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴`\n    *   Therefore, the function `f` has a dependence of `λ⁻⁴`. This inverse fourth-power relationship is characteristic of dipole radiation and is famously seen in Rayleigh scattering (which explains why the sky is blue).\n\n6.  **Combine the Results and Select the Correct Option:**\n    *   The fraction of `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of `f` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   Comparing these results with the given options:\n        A) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n        B) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n        C) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n        D) 1/4, λ⁻³\n    *   Option A perfectly matches our findings.\n\n<<<A>>>"
