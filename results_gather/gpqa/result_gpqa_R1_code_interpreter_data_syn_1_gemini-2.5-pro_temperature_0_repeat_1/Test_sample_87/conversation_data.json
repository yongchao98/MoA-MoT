    "The user wants me to identify the immunological process described in the scenario.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the scenario:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Inner capsid proteins of rotavirus, tagged with GFP.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage, meaning it goes through the gastrointestinal tract.\n    *   **Location of response:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, a key site for initiating mucosal immune responses.\n    *   **Cells of interest:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated from the Peyer's patches. Proliferation in a secondary lymphoid organ upon antigen encounter is characteristic of lymphocyte (B and T cell) activation.\n    *   **Molecular analysis:** The \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these cells is sequenced. The heavy chain is a component of antibodies (immunoglobulins) and B cell receptors (BCRs). T cell receptors (TCRs) also have variable regions, but the term \"heavy chain\" is specific to immunoglobulins. This strongly points to B cells.\n    *   **Key observation:** \"High variability\" is found in this specific gene region.\n\n2.  **Analyze the options in the context of the scenario:**\n\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a system of plasma proteins that are part of the innate immune system. It does not involve genetic changes like sequencing variability in lymphocyte genes. It's a humoral response, but not at the genetic level of the cells producing antibodies. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism by which the immune system adapts to a foreign element. It occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This process, coupled with selection, results in affinity maturation, where the B cells produce antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen. The observation of \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of \"proliferating cells\" in a \"Peyer's patch\" is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation.\n\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, not the *variable* region. This switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common in mucosal responses like in the Peyer's patches) but does not alter the antigen-binding site's sequence or affinity. The key observation is variability in the *variable* region, so while CSR is likely also happening in these cells, SHM is the direct cause of the observed variability.\n\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial diversity of B cell and T cell receptors. It occurs in the primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells, thymus for T cells) during the development of lymphocytes, *before* they encounter an antigen. The scenario describes a response to an antigen in a *secondary* lymphoid organ by an already mature lymphocyte population. The \"high variability\" here is being generated *after* antigen exposure in a proliferating clone, which is characteristic of SHM, not the initial VDJ recombination.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The scenario describes the process of affinity maturation in B cells within a germinal center in a Peyer's patch. The molecular hallmark of this process is the introduction of numerous point mutations into the variable region of the immunoglobulin genes, which is precisely what somatic hypermutation does. Therefore, somatic hypermutation is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
