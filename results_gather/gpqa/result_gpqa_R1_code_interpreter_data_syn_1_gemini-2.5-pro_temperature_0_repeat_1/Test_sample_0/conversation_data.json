    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty in its energy. This relationship is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) is on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\n    \n    ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2\n    \n    For estimations, we can use the approximation:\n    \n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    \n    Here, ΔE represents the inherent \"width\" or \"blurriness\" of the energy level, also known as the natural linewidth. A state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly sharp energy.\n\n3.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ₁): 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ₂): 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) in convenient units: ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n4.  **Determine the Condition for \"Clearly Resolving\" Energy Levels:** To clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be significantly larger than their energy uncertainties. A standard criterion is that the energy separation should be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths (linewidths) of the two states.\n    \n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State:**\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s (This is the shorter lifetime, so it will have the larger energy uncertainty).\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    \n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n6.  **Apply the Resolution Criterion:**\n    *   Calculate the sum of the energy uncertainties:\n        ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n        ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n        ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    \n    *   Therefore, to clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference must be greater than this value:\n        |E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:** Now, we check which of the provided options satisfies this condition.\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (10⁻¹¹ < 7.24 × 10⁻⁷) -> Not resolvable.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV   (10⁻⁹ < 7.24 × 10⁻⁷) -> Not resolvable.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (10⁻⁸ < 7.24 × 10⁻⁷) -> Not resolvable.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV   (10⁻⁴ > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷) -> **Resolvable.**\n\n    Only option D provides an energy separation large enough to overcome the combined energy broadening of the two states.\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# We use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Delta_E * Delta_t >= hbar / 2\n# For a good estimation, we use Delta_E ≈ hbar / tau, where tau is the lifetime.\n# To clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference |E1 - E2| should be\n# greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths), i.e., |E1 - E2| > Delta_E1 + Delta_E2.\n\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# Calculate the minimum required energy difference for resolution\nmin_required_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (Delta_E1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (Delta_E2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required energy difference for resolution (Delta_E1 + Delta_E2): {min_required_difference:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Check which option satisfies the condition |E1 - E2| > min_required_difference\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-8,\n    \"D\": 1e-4\n}\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Checking Options ---\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > min_required_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a valid choice as it is greater than the required minimum of {min_required_difference:.3e} eV.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is not a valid choice.\")\n```\n> 실행 결과:\n```\nEnergy uncertainty for state 1 (Delta_E1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty for state 2 (Delta_E2): 6.582e-08 eV\nMinimum required energy difference for resolution (Delta_E1 + Delta_E2): 7.240e-07 eV\n\n--- Checking Options ---\nOption A (1.0e-11 eV) is not a valid choice.\nOption B (1.0e-09 eV) is not a valid choice.\nOption C (1.0e-08 eV) is not a valid choice.\nOption D (1.0e-04 eV) is a valid choice as it is greater than the required minimum of 7.240e-07 eV.\n```\nThe code confirms our manual calculation.

    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which states that the uncertainty in a quantum state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (τ) are related by:\n\nΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). For estimation purposes, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. This ΔE represents the natural energy width or \"blurriness\" of the energy level.\n\nTo clearly resolve two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths.
