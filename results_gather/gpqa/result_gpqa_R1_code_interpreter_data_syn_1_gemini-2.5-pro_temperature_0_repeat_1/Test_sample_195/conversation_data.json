    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:** The problem involves a conservative force, the spring force given by Hooke's Law ($F = -kx$). Therefore, the total mechanical energy of the oscillator is conserved. The total mechanical energy is the sum of its kinetic energy ($K$) and potential energy ($U$).\n\n2.  **Relativistic Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy:**\n    *   The potential energy stored in the spring is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n    *   Since the problem is relativistic, we must use the relativistic formula for kinetic energy: $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass of the oscillator, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n3.  **Total Mechanical Energy:** The conserved total mechanical energy ($E_{total}$) is:\n    $E_{total} = K + U = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Energy at Two Extreme Points:** We can find the total energy of the system by analyzing it at a point where the energy components are simple to calculate. Then, we can use this total energy value to find the unknown speed at another point.\n\n    *   **At the maximum amplitude ($x = A$):** The mass momentarily comes to a stop before changing direction. At this point, its velocity is $v=0$.\n        *   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n        *   The kinetic energy is $K = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   Therefore, the total energy of the system is $E_{total} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position ($x = 0$):** The potential energy is zero ($U=0$). By conservation of energy, the kinetic energy must be at its maximum. This means the speed of the mass is at its maximum, which we denote as $v_{max}$.\n        *   The potential energy is $U = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        *   The kinetic energy is maximum: $K_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is $E_{total} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0$.\n\n5.  **Equate the Energies and Solve for $v_{max}$:** Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum amplitude is equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n    *   First, isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n        $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    *   Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    *   To solve for $v_{max}$, we first invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    *   Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** This derived expression matches option B.\n\n    *   Option A is the classical (non-relativistic) limit.\n    *   Options C and D have incorrect mathematical forms and/or are dimensionally inconsistent.\n\n<<<B>>>"
