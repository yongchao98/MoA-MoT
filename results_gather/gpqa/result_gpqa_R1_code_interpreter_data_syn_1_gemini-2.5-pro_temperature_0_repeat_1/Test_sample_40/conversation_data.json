    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let S be the laboratory frame (the observer's frame).\n    *   Let S' be the rest frame of the glass.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is given as `v`.\n    *   The speed of light in the glass is determined by its index of refraction, `n`. In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light, let's call it `u'`, is `u' = c / n`.\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`. Therefore, the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1 / n`.\n    *   The light beam and the glass are moving in the same direction.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    *   We need to find the speed of the light beam as measured in the laboratory frame (S), which we'll call `u`.\n    *   The problem involves adding velocities in a relativistic context, so we must use Einstein's velocity addition formula. For motion along a single axis, the formula is:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' * v / c^2)`\n    *   Here, `u` is the velocity in frame S, `u'` is the velocity in frame S', and `v` is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    *   We have `u' = 1/n`, `v = v`, and `c = 1`.\n    *   Substituting these into the formula gives:\n        `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   First, simplify the denominator:\n        `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    *   To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n    *   For the numerator: `(1/n) + v = (1 + n*v) / n`\n    *   For the denominator: `1 + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n    *   Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n        `u = ( (1 + n*v) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n    *   The `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out:\n        `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n        B) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n        C) 1\n        D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   Our result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
