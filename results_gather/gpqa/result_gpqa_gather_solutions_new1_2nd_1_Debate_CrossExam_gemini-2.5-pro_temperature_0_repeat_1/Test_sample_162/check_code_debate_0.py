    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the chemistry problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum volume of 0.1 M strong acid to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3
    in a 100 cm3 total volume, and the resulting pH.

    The method used for verification is the self-consistency check. For each option, we calculate
    the theoretical volume of acid required to both dissolve the Fe(OH)3 and achieve the given pH.
    If this calculated volume matches the volume given in the option, the option is self-consistent.
