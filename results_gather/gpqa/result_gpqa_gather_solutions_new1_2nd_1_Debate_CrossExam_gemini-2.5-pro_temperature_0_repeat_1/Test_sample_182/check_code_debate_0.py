Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, including a list of careful points to consider.

### Step-by-step Analysis

1.  **Analyze the Structure of the Starting Material**
    The starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. To determine the change in the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), we must first calculate the IHD of this reactant. The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.
    *   **Ring:** The `cyclohex-` prefix indicates one six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.
    *   **Pi Bonds (π bonds):**
        1.  The `-3-ene` suffix indicates one C=C double bond within the ring. This contributes **+1**.
        2.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains one C=C double bond. This contributes **+1**.
        3.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) is an aldehyde and contains one C=O double bond. This contributes **+1**.
        4.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond. This contributes **+1**.
    *   **Total Initial IHD:** The sum is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.

2.  **Analyze the Chemical Reaction**
    The reagent used is **red phosphorus (P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a crucial piece of information. This combination is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry, known for its ability to perform exhaustive reductions.
    *   **Effect on C=C bonds:** It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds.
    *   **Effect on C=O bonds:** It completely reduces carbonyl groups (in aldehydes) and carboxyl groups (in carboxylic acids) to their corresponding alkanes. The oxygen atoms are removed, and the groups become methyl (-CH₃) groups.
    *   **Effect on Rings:** This reagent does not break open stable cycloalkane rings.

3.  **Determine the Structure of the Product**
    The reaction will eliminate all the pi bonds from the starting material but will leave the ring structure intact.
    *   The C=C bond in the ring is reduced to a C-C bond.
    *   The C=C bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a C-C bond.
    *   The C=O bond in the formyl group is removed.
    *   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group is removed.
    The final product is a saturated, substituted cyclohexane. It has no double bonds.

4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**
    The IHD of the product is the sum of its remaining rings and pi bonds.
    *   **Number of rings:** The single cyclohexane ring is preserved. The count is **1**.
    *   **Number of pi bonds:** All four pi bonds were reduced to single bonds. The count is **0**.
    *   **Final IHD:** The IHD of the product is 1 (ring) + 0 (pi bonds) = **1**.

### Careful Points

*   **Reagent Specificity:** It is critical to know the specific function of red P and excess HI. It is not a mild reducing agent; it performs a complete reduction of the specified functional groups to the alkane level.
*   **Reactant vs. Product:** The IHD of the starting material is 5, which corresponds to option D. This is a common trap. The question explicitly asks for the IHD of the **product**.
*   **Ring Integrity:** A key aspect of this reaction is that the cycloalkane ring remains intact. The reduction affects the functional groups and multiple bonds, not the fundamental ring skeleton.
*   **IHD Definition:** The final IHD is solely due to the presence of the single ring, as all pi bonds have been eliminated. A molecule with one ring and no pi bonds always has an IHD of 1.
*   **Mapping to Options:** The calculated IHD is 1. Looking at the provided options (A) 3, (B) 0, (C) 1, (D) 5, the correct choice is C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while almost all correctly deduce the IHD is 1, many fail to map this number to the correct letter option.

Based on the comprehensive chemical analysis, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.
