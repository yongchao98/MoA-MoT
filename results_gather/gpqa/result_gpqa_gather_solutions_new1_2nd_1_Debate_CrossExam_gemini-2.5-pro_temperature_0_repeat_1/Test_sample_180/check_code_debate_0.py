def check_neutrino_flux_ratio():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the solar neutrino problem by modeling the physical reasoning.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Define the state of solar neutrino sources after the pp-III branch stops.
        - Boron-8 (⁸B) flux from pp-III is zero.
        - Beryllium-7 (⁷Be) flux from pp-II is unaffected. This is a strong, mono-energetic line at 861 keV.
        - CNO cycle flux is unaffected. This is a continuous, weaker spectrum.
    2.  Calculate the relative flux in the two specified energy bands based on these sources.
    3.  Calculate the ratio of the fluxes.
    4.  Compare the calculated ratio to the value given in the selected answer option.
