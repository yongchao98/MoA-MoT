def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the selected answer for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

    The function verifies the answer against the following physical constraints:
    1.  **Retardation**: The potential must depend on the retarded distance 'd', not the static distance 'r'.
    2.  **Doppler Effect**: The denominator must have the form (dc - d·v) to correctly model the strengthening of the potential as the charge approaches the observer.
    3.  **Correct Form**: The full expressions for both the scalar (V) and vector (A) potentials must match the standard Liénard-Wiechert formulas.
