    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct methodologies from the provided candidate answers and identifying the source of their discrepancies.

    ### Step-by-step Analysis

    1.  **Identify the Governing Physics Principle**: The problem involves the decay of particles moving at relativistic speeds. The solution requires combining the exponential law of particle decay with the concept of time dilation from special relativity.

    2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation**:
        *   The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a certain time is given by the exponential decay law, `f = exp(-t_proper / τ)`, where `t_proper` is the time experienced by the particle (its proper time) and `τ` is its intrinsic mean lifetime (proper lifetime).
        *   From the laboratory's perspective, the particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) at a velocity `v`. Since they are "ultra-relativistic," their velocity is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R/c`.
        *   Due to time dilation, the proper time experienced by the moving particle is shorter than the lab time. The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor, `γ`: `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.
        *   Substituting these relationships into the decay law gives the survival fraction as a function of lab-frame variables:
            `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`

    3.  **Set Up Equations for Both Scenarios**: The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.

        *   **Scenario 1 (Given)**: `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.
            `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`

        *   **Scenario 2 (Target)**: We need to find `γ₂` when `f₂ = 2/3`.
            `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`

    4.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**: The most direct method is to take the natural logarithm of both equations and then take their ratio to eliminate the unknown constant `K`.
        *   From Scenario 1: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  => `K = 20 * ln(3)`
        *   From Scenario 2: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  => `K = -γ₂ * ln(2/3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`

        Equating the two expressions for `K`:
        `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`

        Solving for `γ₂`:
        `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`

    5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value**: Using the standard approximate values for natural logarithms:
        *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`
        *   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`

        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`
        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`
        `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`

    ### Careful Points and Final Decision

    *   **Universal Consensus on Calculation**: A thorough review of all 15 candidate answers shows that every single one correctly derives the formula `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))` and correctly calculates the numerical result to be approximately **54.2**. This indicates extremely high confidence in the physical model and the mathematical result.

    *   **Logical Consistency Check**: To increase the fraction of surviving particles from 1/3 to 2/3, they must decay more slowly over the fixed travel distance. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means the Lorentz factor `γ` must be *higher*. The calculated result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed higher than the initial `γ₁ = 20`, confirming the result is physically sensible.

    *   **Identifying the Source of Error**: The discrepancies in the final letter choices (`<<<A>>>`, `<<<B>>>`, `<<<C>>>`, `<<<D>>>`) among the candidate answers are not due to errors in physics or calculation. The errors arise from incorrectly mapping the correct numerical result (54) to the multiple-choice letters. The agents appear to have been working with different, randomized orderings of the options.

    *   **Final Mapping**: The task is to decide the answer based on the options provided in the original question. The calculated value is `~54.2`. Comparing this to the specific options given:
        A) 40
        B) 54
        C) 68
        D) 28

    The calculated value of 54.18 is closest to **54**, which corresponds to option **B**.
