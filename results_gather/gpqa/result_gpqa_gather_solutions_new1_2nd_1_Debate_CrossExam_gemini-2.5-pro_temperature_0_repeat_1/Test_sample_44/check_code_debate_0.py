    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to the critical points in the calculation.

    ### Step 1: Analyze the System and Governing Principles

    The problem describes a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles within a one-dimensional infinite potential well.

    *   **Careful Point 1: Particle Type:** The particles are specified as "spin-1/2". In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**. This is the most crucial piece of information.
    *   **Careful Point 2: Governing Principle:** Identical fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.
    *   **Careful Point 3: Quantum State Definition:** For this system, a particle's quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up or spin-down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles (one with spin-up, one with spin-down).

    ### Step 2: Define the Single-Particle Energy Levels

    The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by the formula $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.

    *   **Careful Point 4: Using the Base Energy Unit:** The problem simplifies this by defining a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels are simply $E_n = n^2 E$.
        *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$
        *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$
        *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$
        *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$

    ### Step 3: Calculate the Ground State Energy

    The ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. We fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.

    *   **Careful Point 5: Correctly Filling the Levels:**
        *   Place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times E = 2E$.
        *   Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.
    *   **Total Ground State Energy** = $2E + 8E = \bf{10E}$.

    ### Step 4: Calculate the First Excited State Energy

    The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy *above* the ground state.

    *   **Careful Point 6: Identifying the "Cheapest" Excitation:** This is achieved by making the smallest possible energy jump for a single particle. We promote one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).
        *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.
    *   **Total First Excited State Energy** = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \bf{15E}$.

    ### Step 5: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy

    The second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy. We must compare the energies of different possible single-particle promotions from the ground state.

    *   **Careful Point 7: Systematically Finding the Next Lowest Energy:**
        *   The first excitation (n=2 â†’ n=3) resulted in a total energy of 15E.
        *   Let's consider the next possibilities:
            *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest empty level, `n=3`. The configuration becomes: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.
                *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = E + 8E + 9E = \bf{18E}$.
            *   **Possibility B:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to the next available level, `n=4`. The configuration becomes: two in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=4`.
                *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.
    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is **18E**.

    ### Step 6: Final Conclusion

    The calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E, 15E, and 18E**, respectively.

    Comparing this result with the given options:
    A) 4E, 10E, 50E
    B) 4E, 10E, 15E
    C) 10E, 15E, 18E
    D) 30E, 39E, 50E

    The calculated sequence perfectly matches option C. The analysis of the candidate answers reveals that while nearly all of them performed the physics calculation correctly, many mapped the result to an incorrect letter, likely because they were presented with a different set of options. Based on the question provided, the correct choice is C.
