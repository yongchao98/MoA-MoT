    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for a quantum mechanics problem.

    Problem:
    An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin 
    along y-direction, S_y.
    Note: σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The spin operator S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

    The provided final answer is <<<A>>>, with the options listed as:

    C) 12*hbar/25
