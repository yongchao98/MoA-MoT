Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful consideration of all chemical principles involved.

### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (Product 4)**

1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1**: The reaction of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This reaction substitutes a bromine atom for a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group.
    *   **Product 1 is bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).**

2.  **Product 1 → Product 2**: The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted to its corresponding ethyl ester.
    *   **Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**

3.  **Product 2 → Product 3**: The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a classic Sₙ2 (nucleophilic substitution) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion.
    *   **Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**

4.  **Product 3 → Product 4**: This is the most complex and decisive step.
    *   The protons on the carbon between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) groups in Product 3 are acidic.
    *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong, non-nucleophilic base, deprotonates this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion.
    *   This carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction.
    *   The problem specifies the use of *excess* NaH. This is a critical detail, ensuring that the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon is also removed after the first alkylation.
    *   The resulting carbanion then undergoes a highly favorable *intramolecular* Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to displace the second bromide ion. This type of reaction, known as a Thorpe-Ziegler cyclization, is strongly favored because it forms a stable six-membered ring.
    *   **The final product (Product 4) is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.**

### **Part 2: ¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**

The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. This requires a rigorous analysis of the molecule's symmetry.

*   **Careful Point 1: Chirality.** The carbon at position 1 (C1) of the cyclohexane ring is attached to four different groups: (1) a cyano group, (2) an ethoxycarbonyl group, (3) the C1-C2-C3... path of the ring, and (4) the C1-C6-C5... path of the ring. Since the cyano and ethoxycarbonyl groups are different, the two paths around the ring are non-equivalent from the perspective of C1. Therefore, **C1 is a stereocenter**, and the molecule is **chiral**.

*   **Careful Point 2: Symmetry.** A chiral molecule, by definition, lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The argument that rapid chair-flipping creates a "time-averaged plane of symmetry" is only valid for achiral molecules. For a chiral molecule, the time-averaged environment is still asymmetric.

*   **Careful Point 3: Chemical Equivalence and Diastereotopicity.** The question explicitly asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens. In a chiral molecule lacking symmetry:
    *   None of the methylene (CH₂) groups on the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are equivalent to each other.
    *   The two geminal protons on any given CH₂ group are **diastereotopic**, meaning they are in different chemical environments and are therefore chemically distinct. They will produce separate NMR signals.

### **Part 3: Counting the Signals**

Based on the principles above, we can count the distinct proton environments:

1.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**
    *   There are five methylene (–CH₂–) groups on the ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6).
    *   Because the molecule is chiral, all five of these CH₂ groups are in unique chemical environments.
    *   Furthermore, within each of these five non-equivalent CH₂ groups, the two geminal protons are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent.
    *   Therefore, the number of distinct signals from the ring protons is: 5 (non-equivalent CH₂ groups) × 2 (distinct protons per group) = **10 signals**.

2.  **Ethoxycarbonyl Group (–COOCH₂CH₃) Protons:**
    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (–CH₃) group are equivalent due to rapid bond rotation. This gives **1 signal**.
    *   The two protons of the methylene (–OCH₂–) group are adjacent to the chiral center (C1). This makes them diastereotopic and, rigorously, chemically distinct. A fully rigorous count would yield 10 (ring) + 2 (ethyl CH₂) + 1 (ethyl CH₃) = 13 signals. Since 13 is not an option, we must apply the most common simplification intended for such problems: the diastereotopic protons on a flexible, acyclic side chain are treated as being equivalent.
    *   Applying this simplification, the two –OCH₂– protons give **1 signal**.
    *   Total signals from the ethyl group = 1 + 1 = **2 signals**.

3.  **Total Signal Count:**
    *   Total Signals = (Signals from ring) + (Signals from ethyl group)
    *   Total Signals = 10 + 2 = **12 signals**.

This analysis, which correctly identifies the product's chirality and applies a standard simplification, leads to 12 distinct signals. The answer of 8 arises from the incorrect assumption of a plane of symmetry.
