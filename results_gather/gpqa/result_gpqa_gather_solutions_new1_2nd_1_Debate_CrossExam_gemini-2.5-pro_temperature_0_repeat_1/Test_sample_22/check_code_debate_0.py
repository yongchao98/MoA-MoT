    # --- Chemical Reaction Analysis ---

    # Step 1: Initial Reaction - Protonation of the Alkene
    # Reactant: ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene
    # Reagent: HBr (strong acid)
    # The electrophile H+ attacks the electron-rich alkene.
    # According to Markovnikov's rule, H+ adds to the terminal CH2 to form the most stable carbocation.
    # This creates a secondary carbocation: Ph-O-CH2-C(Me)2-CH(+)-CH3
    initial_intermediate = "secondary carbocation"

    # Step 2: Competing Pathways for the Carbocation Intermediate
    # The observation of two products suggests two major competing pathways.

    # Pathway 1: Direct Intramolecular Cyclization
    # The electron-rich benzene ring (internal nucleophile) attacks the secondary carbocation.
    # This intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation forms a 6-membered ring.
    product_from_path_1 = "3,3,4-trimethylchromane"

    # Pathway 2: Rearrangement followed by Intramolecular Cyclization
    # The secondary carbocation can undergo a 1,2-methyl shift to form a more stable tertiary carbocation.
    # Rearranged intermediate: Ph-O-CH2-C(+)(Me)-CH(Me)2
    # The benzene ring then attacks this more stable tertiary carbocation.
    # This cyclization forms a 5-membered ring.
    product_from_path_2 = "3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran"

    predicted_products = {product_from_path_1, product_from_path_2}

    # --- Analysis of Alternative (Incorrect) Pathways ---
    # Option A: Requires ether cleavage AND reduction of the C=C bond. HBr is not a reducing agent. Invalid.
    # Option D: Represents Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov addition of HBr. Anti-Markovnikov addition is highly unlikely under these ionic conditions (requires radicals). This pathway also ignores the kinetically favored intramolecular cyclization.

    # --- Verification ---
    # Find which option from the list matches our predicted products.
