    Mg_H_2 = 0.0   # [Mg/H]_2

    # --- Step-by-step calculation ---

    # Step 1: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance for Star 1, [Si/H]_1.
    # The key property is [A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C].
    # So, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1.
    Si_H_1 = Si_Fe_1 + Fe_H_1

    # Step 2: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance for Star 2, [Si/H]_2.
    # The property is [Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2.
    # We rearrange to solve for [Si/H]_2: [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2.
    Si_H_2 = Mg_H_2 - Mg_Si_2

    # Step 3: Calculate the logarithm of the final ratio.
    # The ratio R is (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2.
    # The logarithm of the ratio is log10(R) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2.
    log_ratio = Si_H_1 - Si_H_2

    # Step 4: Calculate the final linear ratio R.
    # R = 10^log_ratio.
