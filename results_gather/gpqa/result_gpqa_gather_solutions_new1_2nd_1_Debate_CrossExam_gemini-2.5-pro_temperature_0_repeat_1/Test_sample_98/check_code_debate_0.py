    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the given chemistry problem.

    The function analyzes each candidate molecule to see if it satisfies the
    Â¹H NMR constraints:
    1.  Presence of a proton environment that would produce a 'doublet of triplets of quartets' (dtq).
        This requires a CH group adjacent to a CH, a CH2, and a CH3 group.
    2.  Presence of a proton environment that would produce a 'doublet of triplets of triplets' (dtt).
        This requires a CH group adjacent to a CH and two different CH2 groups.

    It then compares its conclusion with the provided answer.
