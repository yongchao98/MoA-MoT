def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the relativistic harmonic oscillator problem.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Defines all symbolic variables and the candidate answers.
    2. Symbolically derives the correct expression for v_max from the principle of
       conservation of total relativistic energy.
    3. Compares the derived expression with the proposed correct answer (Option B).
    4. Checks all options against physical constraints (dimensional consistency,
       v < c, and the non-relativistic limit).
    5. Returns "Correct" if Option B is validated, otherwise returns a detailed
       explanation of the error.
