Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers to arrive at the most logical conclusion.

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Technical Problem

The question describes a specific, advanced numerical method for solving the heat equation. The key steps are:
1.  **Discretization:** The physical problem (a partial differential equation) is converted into a large system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form `dU/dt = AU`. Here, `U` is a vector representing the temperature at all points on a grid, and `A` is a large matrix representing the spatial relationships.
2.  **Time-Stepping:** The solution over a small time step is formally given by `U(t+Δt) = exp(AΔt)U(t)`. The core of the computation is the matrix exponential.
3.  **Approximation:** Calculating the matrix exponential is very difficult. Therefore, it is replaced by a "fractional approximation," which is a rational function (a fraction of polynomials), `R(z)`. The calculation becomes `U_new ≈ R(AΔt)U_old`.
4.  **The Goal:** The objective is to convert the algorithm from a sequential one (solving one big problem) to a parallel one (solving many small problems simultaneously) using "parallel splitting."

The central question is: What is the specific mathematical technique or property that allows this "splitting" to happen?

### Step 2: Analyze the Sequential Bottleneck vs. the Parallel Solution

*   **Sequential Bottleneck:** A sequential approach to calculating `U_new = R(AΔt)U_old` involves solving a single, very large, and complex linear system. This is because the rational function `R(z)` has a denominator, leading to an implicit equation that couples all the elements of `U_new` together. This single step is a computational bottleneck.
*   **Parallel Solution:** The fundamental principle of parallel computing is to break a large task into smaller, **independent** sub-tasks. The reasoning across nearly all candidate answers converges on a single mechanism for achieving this: **partial fraction decomposition**.

This algebraic technique rewrites the complex rational function `R(z)` as a sum of much simpler fractions:
`R(z) = c₀ + Σ [cᵢ / (z - pᵢ)]`

When this decomposition is applied to the matrix `AΔt`, the single large calculation is transformed into a sum of independent operations. Each term in the sum requires solving a linear system of the form `(AΔt - pᵢI)yᵢ = U_old`. The most important point, highlighted correctly in the majority of the candidate analyses, is that each of these linear systems is **completely independent** of the others. They can therefore be solved simultaneously on different processors. This is the essence of the "parallel splitting" algorithm.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Options Based on the Analysis

Now, we can evaluate the given options against this clear mechanism.

*   **A) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions:** This describes a property of the physical problem. Nonlocal conditions create global dependencies in the matrix `A`, which is a significant **obstacle** to parallelization, not an enabler. This option is incorrect.
*   **B) Complex roots of fractional approximation:** The roots `pᵢ` in the partial fraction expansion can be real or complex. This is a property of the chosen approximation and affects the type of arithmetic (real vs. complex) used in the independent sub-problems. However, it is not the *enabling factor* for parallelism. The parallelism comes from the **decomposition into a sum**, which is the more fundamental principle and works regardless of the nature of the roots.
*   **C) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation:** This option is the precise name for the mathematical technique described in Step 2. It is the algebraic decomposition of the "fractional approximation" into a sum of "linear partial fractions" that directly creates the independent, parallelizable sub-tasks. This is the key factor that converts the sequential algorithm into a parallel one.
*   **D) Stability analysis:** Stability is a critical requirement for any numerical method to produce a correct, non-diverging solution. It is a prerequisite for a *valid* algorithm, but it is not the mechanism that *parallelizes* it. A method must be stable to work at all, but stability itself doesn't break the problem into parallel parts.

### Step 4: Final Conclusion

The reasoning presented in the vast majority of the candidate answers is sound and consistent, even if their final letter choices are erratic. The consensus is that the conversion from a sequential to a parallel algorithm is made possible by the algebraic decomposition of the rational operator into a sum of independent, simpler operators. This process is precisely the **linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation**.
