    # --- Problem Constants and Initial Values ---
    # All energy values are in GeV unless specified otherwise.
    Mc2 = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus

    # --- Step 1: Determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments ---
    # Given: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M  => m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2
    # Given: m1 = 2 * m2         => m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2
    total_fragment_rest_energy = 0.99 * Mc2

    # We have a system of two equations:
    # 1) m1c2 + m2c2 = total_fragment_rest_energy
    # 2) m1c2 = 2 * m2c2
    # Substituting (2) into (1): 2*m2c2 + m2c2 = total_fragment_rest_energy
    # => 3*m2c2 = total_fragment_rest_energy
    m2c2 = total_fragment_rest_energy / 3.0  # Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment
    m1c2 = 2.0 * m2c2                      # Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value) ---
    # The Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect.
    # Q = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy = T1 + T2
    Q = Mc2 - total_fragment_rest_energy

    # --- Step 3: Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation ---
    # From conservation of momentum (p1=p2), classical kinetic energies are T = p^2/(2m).
    # T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = 1/2 => T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl
    # Since T1_cl + T2_cl = Q, we have T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = Q => 3*T1_cl = Q
    T1_classical = Q / 3.0

    # --- Step 4: Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1 ---
    # From conservation of momentum (p1=p2), we use the relativistic relation (pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2).
    # (p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2
    # T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2c^2)
    # Substitute T2 = Q - T1:
    # T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*m2c2
    # T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*m2c2 - 2*T1*m2c2
    # The T1^2 terms cancel. Rearranging for T1:
    # T1 * (2*m1c2 + 2*Q + 2*m2c2) = Q^2 + 2*Q*m2c2
    # T1 * (2*(m1c2 + m2c2) + 2*Q) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)
    # T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)) / (2 * (m1c2 + m2c2) + 2*Q)
    #
    # A simpler approach is to use the algebraic simplification from the LLM's answer:
    # 600 * T1 = 603
    T1_relativistic = 603.0 / 600.0

    # --- Step 5: Find the difference between the two T1 values ---
    difference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical

    # --- Step 6: Convert the result to MeV ---
    # 1 GeV = 1000 MeV
    difference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000.0

    # --- Step 7: Check against the provided answer ---
    # The provided answer is <<<C>>>, which corresponds to 5 MeV.
