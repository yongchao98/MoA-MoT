def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the molecular biology question.

    The function formalizes the logical steps required to answer the question:
    1.  A dominant-negative mutation is a loss-of-function, not gain-of-function.
    2.  A dominant mutation causes a mutant phenotype, not wild-type.
    3.  For a dimeric protein, a dominant-negative effect requires the mutant to
        dimerize with the wild-type to interfere. A complete loss of dimerization
        would be recessive.
    4.  The best answer is the most precise. "Loss-of-function of the wild-type allele"
        is the definition of a dominant-negative effect.
