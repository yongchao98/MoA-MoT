Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating careful points to consider for a robust conclusion.

**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Primary Chemical Principle**

The task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. The outcome of this reaction is governed by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring. This allows for a clear, two-group classification.

**Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**

This is the most important step, as it separates the compounds into two distinct sets based on para-isomer yield.

*   **Group 1: Meta-Directing Groups (Low Para-Yield)**
    These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer and will be at the beginning of the ordered list.
    *   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group is strongly deactivating.
    *   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxyl group is deactivating.
    *   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group is deactivating.

*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (High Para-Yield)**
    These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer. They will be at the end of the ordered list.
    *   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group is activating.
    *   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is activating.
    *   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group is deactivating but directs ortho, para.

**Careful Point 1:** The final sequence must place all compounds from Group 1 before all compounds from Group 2. This immediately eliminates option D (3<5<1<6<2<4), which incorrectly places ortho, para-directors first.

**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Group 1)**

For these compounds, the yield of the minor para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more powerful deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.

*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.
*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this strength: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.

**Careful Point 2:** The correct sequence must begin with `4 < 6 < 2`. Checking the remaining options:
*   A) 4<**2<6**... — Incorrect.
*   B) **6<2<4**... — Incorrect.
*   C) **4<6<2**... — Correct.

Based on this step alone, option C is the only possible correct answer. The analysis of the second group serves as a confirmation.

**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Group 2)**

For these compounds, the order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.

*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.
*   **Comparing with the Chloro Group (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it is deactivating overall, it is an ortho, para-director. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is felt most strongly at the nearby ortho positions, deactivating them more than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with its size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data confirms that the para-isomer yield for the halogenation of chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.

*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.

**Step 5: Assemble the Final Sequence and Verify**

By combining the two ordered groups, we get the complete sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:

(Group 1) < (Group 2)
**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**

The final, complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.

**Careful Point 3:** The final step is to meticulously match this derived sequence to the given options.
*   A) 4<2<6<3<1<5
*   B) 6<2<4<5<1<3
*   C) 4<6<2<1<5<3
*   D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

The derived sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** is an exact match for option C. Many of the provided candidate answers correctly deduced this sequence but failed at this final matching step, incorrectly linking their reasoning to a different letter.
