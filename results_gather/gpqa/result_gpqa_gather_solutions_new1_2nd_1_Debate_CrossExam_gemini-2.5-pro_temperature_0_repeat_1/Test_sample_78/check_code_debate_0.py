    2. Deduce the necessary structural features of the starting material (Compound X).

    # - 13C NMR δ 197.7 ppm indicates a ketone (C=O).
    # - 1H NMR δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d) is a classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring.
    # - 1H NMR δ 2.31 (3H, s) is consistent with a methyl group on this ring.

    # The reaction is a base-catalyzed rearrangement. It is chemically implausible for a methyl group
    # to be added to or moved onto the benzene ring under these conditions.
