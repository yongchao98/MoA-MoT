    Checks the correctness of the answer to the relativistic velocity addition problem.

    The function performs three checks:
    1. Derives the correct formula from the relativistic velocity addition principle.
    2. Checks if the proposed answer's formula matches the derived formula.
    3. Checks if the proposed answer's formula satisfies two physical constraints:
       - The vacuum case (n=1, speed should be 1).
