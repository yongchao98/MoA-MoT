    # 1. The luminosity ratio is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
    # L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4
    # The radius component is (1.5)^2 = 2.25
    radius_component = radius_ratio**2

    # 2. The temperature ratio must account for the Doppler effect.
    # Wien's Law: T ∝ 1/λ_rest => T1/T2 = λ_rest_2 / λ_rest_1
    # Doppler Effect: λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) for a receding source.
    # We are given that the observed wavelengths are the same: λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2
    # For Star 1 (v1=0): λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1
    # For Star 2 (v2=700 km/s): λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)
    # Equating them: λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)
    # We need the ratio for the temperature calculation: λ_rest_2 / λ_rest_1 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)
    # Therefore, the temperature ratio is: T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)
