    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the quantum mechanics question.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Define the physical constraints (electric dipole selection rules).
    2.  Define a function to check if a transition between two states is allowed.
    3.  Define a function to calculate the theoretical probability of a specific decay path.
        - This is based on the spherical symmetry of the initial |n,0,0> state, which leads to
          equally probable decay channels to the intermediate |n',1,m'> states.
    4.  Parse each multiple-choice option to extract its decay path and given probability.
    5.  For each option, verify if its path is valid and its probability is correct.
    6.  Identify the single correct option based on this physical analysis.
    7.  Compare the identified correct option with the LLM's provided answer.
    8.  Return "Correct" if they match, or a detailed reason if they don't.
