    # alkylation, deprotection) preserve the six-membered cyclohexanone ring.

    # In Step 2, a benzyl group is added to C2, making it a quaternary carbon (no attached protons).
    # In Step 3, LDA (a strong, bulky base) is used to form a kinetic enolate. It must deprotonate
    # the most accessible alpha-proton. Since C2 has no protons, deprotonation MUST occur at C6.
    # Therefore, the methyl group must be added to C6.
    expected_methyl_position = 6

    # Constraint 3: Stereochemistry
    # Step 1: C4 starts as (S).
    # Step 2: Phenyl adds to C3 anti to the C4-OTBS group -> C3 becomes (R).
    #          Benzyl adds to C2 anti to the C3-Phenyl group -> C2 becomes (S).
    # Step 3: Methyl adds to C6, directed by existing bulky groups -> C6 becomes (S).
    # The final expected stereochemistry is (2S,3R,4S,6S).
