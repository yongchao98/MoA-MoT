    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the given chemistry question.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1.  Parses the final answer choice (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D') from the LLM's response.
    2.  Maps the choice to the corresponding chemical formula based on the question's option list.
    3.  Independently deduces the correct chemical formula by systematically analyzing the spectroscopic data (constraints) provided in the question.
    4.  Compares the LLM's chosen formula with the independently deduced formula.
    5.  Performs additional checks, such as calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), to ensure all constraints are met and other options are invalid.
    6.  Returns "Correct" if the answer is valid, or an error message explaining the discrepancy.

    Based on a systematic analysis of the spectroscopic data provided in the question and a review of the reasoning presented in the candidate answers, the correct chemical formula can be determined.

    ### Step-by-step Analysis

    1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Fragments:**
        *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This establishes a core structure of a benzene ring with two substituents. The formula for this fragment is **C₆H₄**.
        *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms and one carbonyl carbon.
        *   **¹H NMR - Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific and highly characteristic splitting pattern is a signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.
        *   **¹H NMR - Two –CH₃ signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group. The other must belong to the ester functionality.
        *   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It rules out any alkyl chains with methylene groups, such as an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the second methyl group must be part of a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)**.

    2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**
        By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall chemical formula.
        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 1 (from the ester's C=O) + 1 (from the ester's -OCH₃) = **11 Carbons**
        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from the C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's -OCH₃) = **12 Hydrogens**
        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the -COO- ester group) = **2 Oxygens**

        The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.

    3.  **Verify the Result Against the Options:**
        The derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, must be matched to the original list of options provided in the question:
        *   **A) C11H12O2** - This matches the derived formula.
        *   **B) C11H14O2** - This formula has two extra hydrogens, which would likely saturate the propenyl double bond, creating -CH₂- groups that are explicitly absent.
        *   **C) C12H14O2** - This formula contains an extra CH₂ group compared to the derived formula, which is ruled out by the NMR data.
        *   **D) C12H12O2** - This formula has an incorrect carbon count.

    ### Careful Points to List

    *   **Fragment Identification:** The most crucial step is to correctly translate each piece of spectroscopic data into a specific molecular fragment (C₆H₄, -COO-, -CH=CH-CH₃, -CH₃).
    *   **Interpreting Splitting Patterns:** The "doublet and doublet of quartets" is a specific pattern that must be correctly identified as a propenyl group. Misinterpreting this would lead to an incorrect structure.
    *   **Using Negative Evidence:** The "no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups" is a powerful constraint that eliminates many alternative structures, such as ethyl esters or propyl groups.
    *   **Systematic Summation:** All atoms from all identified fragments must be carefully summed to prevent miscalculation of the final formula.
    *   **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** As a final check, the DoU for the proposed structure (1 ring + 1 C=C + 1 C=O = 6) should match the DoU calculated from the formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂ gives DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6). This confirms consistency.
    *   **Matching to Original Options:** It is essential to match the derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) back to the original list of options provided in the prompt, as the lettering may vary in different contexts.
