def check_chemistry_problem():
    """
    This function verifies the answer to the stereochemistry problem by modeling the chemical logic.

    The logic is based on two key principles:
    1.  **Chemoselectivity of Reducing Agents**:
        - LiBH4 selectively reduces esters over carboxylic acids.
        - BH3 selectively reduces carboxylic acids over esters.
    2.  **Stereochemical Designation (R/S Label)**:
        - The R/S label is determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups on the chiral center.
        - A reaction can change a functional group, which may alter its CIP priority relative to other groups.
        - If the priorities of two groups swap, the R/S label inverts, even if the 3D configuration is retained.
