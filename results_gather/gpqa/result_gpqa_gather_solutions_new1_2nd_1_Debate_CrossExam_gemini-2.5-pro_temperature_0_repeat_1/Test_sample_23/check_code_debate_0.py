    # Constraint: Hydrocarbon with H mass fraction ~14.28% (1/7), saturated, common solvent.

    # Most common solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12).

    # Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.

    # Candidates: Cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).
    # H atoms sum: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.
    # 1,4-Cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. This fits.
