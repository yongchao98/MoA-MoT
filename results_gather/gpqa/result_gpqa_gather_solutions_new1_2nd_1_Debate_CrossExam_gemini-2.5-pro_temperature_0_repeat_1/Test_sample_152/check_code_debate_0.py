    # --- Ground Truth Analysis based on Chemical Principles ---

    # Analysis of Reaction A:
    # The nucleophile (enolate of dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta-carbon of the Michael acceptor
    # (methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate). The beta-carbon is the one bonded to the p-tolyl group.
    # This regioselectivity leads to a product with the p-tolyl group on the C2 position of the resulting
    # propane-tricarboxylate backbone.
    correct_A = "trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate"

    # Analysis of Reaction B:
    # This is a Stork enamine synthesis. After the Michael addition, the reaction is worked up with
    # aqueous acid (H3O+). This crucial step hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium salt back to a ketone.
    # For simple ketones, the keto-enol equilibrium heavily favors the more stable keto form.
    # Therefore, the product is the "oxo" compound, not the "hydroxy" enol.
    correct_B = "3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile"

    # Analysis of Reaction C:
    # This is a retrosynthesis problem. The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.
    # The "3-oxobutyl" group comes from the Michael acceptor, but-3-en-2-one (MVK).
    # The rest of the molecule, the Michael donor (C), must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The nucleophilic
    # attack occurs from the highly acidic C2 position (the active methylene group between the two carbonyls).
