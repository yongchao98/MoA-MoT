    This function checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer to the astronomy problem.

    The problem asks for the maximum orbital period of a second planet that can still transit its star.
    The solution involves:
    1. Using the shared orbital plane and impact parameter information to find the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.
    2. Applying Kepler's Third Law to find the maximum period of the second planet.

    # The maximum orbital period corresponds to the maximum semi-major axis that still allows a transit.
    # The standard simplified model for this limit is a "grazing" transit where the planet's
    # center passes over the star's limb. This corresponds to a maximum impact parameter of 1.
    # The radii of the planets and star are considered extraneous information for this standard model,
    # which is strongly suggested by the proximity of the result to one of the options.

    # --- Step 2: Relate the two orbits to find the ratio of semi-major axes ---
    # The impact parameter b is defined as b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s.
    # Since both planets share the same orbital plane (same inclination 'i') and orbit the same star (same R_s),
    # the ratio of their semi-major axes is equal to the ratio of their impact parameters.
    # a2 / a1 = b2 / b1
    a_ratio = b2_max / b1

    # --- Step 3: Apply Kepler's Third Law to find the maximum period for Planet 2 ---
    # Kepler's Third Law for two planets around the same star: (P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3
    # Solving for P2: P2 = P1 * (a2 / a1)^(3/2)
