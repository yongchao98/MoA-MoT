    # --- Physics Calculation ---
    # The problem can be solved by establishing a direct relationship between orbital period (P) and equilibrium temperature (T_eq).
    # 1. Equilibrium temperature vs. orbital distance (a): T_eq ∝ 1/√a  =>  a ∝ T_eq⁻²
    # 2. Kepler's Third Law: P² ∝ a³  =>  P ∝ a^(3/2)
    # 3. Combining these two relationships: P ∝ (T_eq⁻²)^(3/2) = T_eq⁻³
    # This means the ratio of periods is the inverse cube of the ratio of temperatures: P_j / P_i = (T_i / T_j)³
