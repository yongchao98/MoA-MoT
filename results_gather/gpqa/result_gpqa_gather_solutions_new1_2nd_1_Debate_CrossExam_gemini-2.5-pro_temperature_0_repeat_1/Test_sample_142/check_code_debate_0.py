    # Product: 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one (a 6-membered ring)
    # Principle: A Pinacol rearrangement involving a cyclic diol can lead to ring expansion.
    # To form a 6-membered ring (cyclohexanone) product, the starting material must have a 5-membered ring (cyclopentanol derivative) that expands.
    # A 6-membered ring starting material would expand to a 7-membered ring.

    # Starting Material: methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate
    # Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-COOCH3
    # Principle: The reaction proceeds via the most stable carbocation (at C2, which is tertiary and benzylic).
    # Then, a group from the adjacent carbon (C3) migrates. The groups on C3 are a hydrogen (H) and a methyl group (CH3).
    # The migratory aptitude order is H > CH3. Therefore, a hydride shift is strongly preferred over a methyl shift.
