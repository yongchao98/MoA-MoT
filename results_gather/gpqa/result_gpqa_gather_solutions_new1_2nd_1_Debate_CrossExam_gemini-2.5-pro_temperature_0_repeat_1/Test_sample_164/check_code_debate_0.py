Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Chemical Problem
The core task is to produce polyethylene with "regular branches" using only ethylene as the reactant. This requires a dual-catalyst system in a process known as tandem catalysis. The process involves two distinct, simultaneous reactions:
1.  **Oligomerization:** This is the "essential additional reaction step." One catalyst must selectively convert some of the ethylene into a specific short-chain alpha-olefin (e.g., trimerizing three ethylene molecules into one 1-hexene molecule). The high selectivity of this step is crucial for creating "regular" branches of a consistent length.
2.  **Copolymerization:** A second catalyst must polymerize the remaining ethylene while incorporating the newly formed alpha-olefin as a comonomer, creating a branched polymer chain (similar to Linear Low-Density Polyethylene, LLDPE).

### Step 2: Systematically Evaluate Each Statement Based on Candidate Consensus

A careful review of the 15 candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the factual basis for each statement, even if their final letter choices are inconsistent due to different labeling.

*   **Statement A: Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**
    *   **Analysis:** There is a clear consensus that this statement is misleading and not the correct answer for this specific problem. While noble metals (like palladium) can create branched polyethylene, they typically do so via a "chain-walking" mechanism. This process produces a variety of branch lengths and structures (hyperbranching), which is inconsistent with the goal of creating "regular branches" from a specific comonomer. Therefore, this technology is not suitable for the stated goal.
    *   **Verdict:** Incorrect in this context.

*   **Statement B: Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**
    *   **Analysis:** There is unanimous agreement among all candidate answers that this statement is factually incorrect. The essential step is the selective oligomerization of ethylene. The industrial-standard catalysts for this reaction (particularly those based on chromium) absolutely require an aluminum-based compound (e.g., methylaluminoxane (MAO) or other organoaluminum reagents) as an activator or co-catalyst to function.
    *   **Verdict:** Factually incorrect.

*   **Statement C: One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**
    *   **Analysis:** There is overwhelming consensus that this statement is factually correct, unambiguous, and fundamental to the problem. Group VIa (also known as Group 6) contains Chromium (Cr). Chromium-based catalysts are the state-of-the-art industrial technology for the highly selective oligomerization of ethylene to 1-hexene and 1-octene. This is precisely the function required of the second catalyst to generate the comonomers for regular branches. These catalysts indeed require "specific activators," which are typically the aluminum-based compounds that statement B incorrectly dismisses.
    *   **Verdict:** Factually correct.

*   **Statement D: Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**
    *   **Analysis:** The consensus is that this statement is ambiguous and likely incorrect under a strict technical interpretation. The term "combined system" implies a single-reactor process where both oligomerization and polymerization occur simultaneously. While the *component technologies* (e.g., producing 1-hexene in one plant and using it in another) are heavily industrialized in the US, the integrated one-pot system is a major research goal but is not the current widespread, large-scale industrial practice.
    *   **Verdict:** Incorrect under a strict interpretation.

### Step 3: Final Conclusion

After a thorough analysis of the chemical principles and the reasoning provided in the candidate answers, a clear conclusion emerges:
*   Statement B is definitively false.
*   Statements A and D are incorrect in the specific context of the question, with A being irrelevant to the goal and D misrepresenting the current state of industrial implementation.
*   Statement C is the only option that is a direct, unambiguous, and fundamentally correct chemical fact that describes the core technology required to solve the scientist's problem.
