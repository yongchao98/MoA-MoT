    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for a chemistry reagent question.

    The function validates the answer based on established chemical principles for two reactions:
    1. Cyanohydrin formation: Requires a proton source (H3O+) for the workup.
    2. Nitrile hydrolysis: Requires a strong acid catalyst (HCl) for effective conversion.

        llm_answer_str: The string containing the final answer from the LLM,
                        expected in the format '<<<X>>>'.

    Returns:
        A string indicating "Correct" or a detailed reason for the incorrectness.
