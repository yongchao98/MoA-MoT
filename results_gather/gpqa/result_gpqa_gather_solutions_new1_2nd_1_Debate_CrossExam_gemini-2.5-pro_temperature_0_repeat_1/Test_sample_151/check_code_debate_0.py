    Checks the correctness of the answer to the biological question.

    The logic is based on the cellular state of a yeast shmoo:
    1. Cell cycle is arrested in G1.
    2. Gene transcription is highly active.
    3. DNA replication (S phase) is inhibited.
    4. The experiment targets "active chromatin", which in this context means
       transcriptionally active regions.

    The complex that is least observed will be the one associated with the
