    This function symbolically derives the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr)
    and distance (r) to verify the provided answer.

    The derivation follows these steps:
    1.  Interpret "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5" as a number density function:
        dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5. This is the standard interpretation in physics and astronomy.
    2.  Use the fundamental relationship between distance and parallax: plx = 1/r.
    3.  Apply the chain rule for transforming densities to find dN/dr:
        dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|. The absolute value (Jacobian) is crucial.
    4.  Perform the substitutions and simplify the expression.
    5.  Compare the derived result with the provided answer.
