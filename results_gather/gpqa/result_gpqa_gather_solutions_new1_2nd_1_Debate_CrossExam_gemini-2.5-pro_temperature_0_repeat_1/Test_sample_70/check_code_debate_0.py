    # 1. The relationship between equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and orbital distance (a) is:
    #    T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)
    # 2. Kepler's Third Law states P^2 ∝ a^3, which means a ∝ P^(2/3).
    # 3. Combining these gives the relationship between temperature and period:
    #    T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)  =>  T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)
    # 4. Therefore, the ratio of temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is (P2 / P4)^(1/3).
