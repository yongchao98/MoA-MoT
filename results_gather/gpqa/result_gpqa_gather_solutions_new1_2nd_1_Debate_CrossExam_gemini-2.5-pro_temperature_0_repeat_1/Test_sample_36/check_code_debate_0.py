    # Step 1: Determine the correct number of 13C-NMR signals based on chemical principles.
    # The reaction sequence leads to the final product E: 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.
    # The structure is (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH3)2.
    # We need to analyze its symmetry to find the number of unique carbon environments.

    # Symmetry analysis of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene:
    # 1. The molecule is highly symmetrical around the central C=C double bond.
    # 2. A C2 axis of rotation passes through the midpoint of the C=C bond, making the
    #    four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.
    # 3. A plane of symmetry also exists, bisecting the C=C bond.
    # 4. Crucially, since each carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical
    #    groups (two ethyl groups), no E/Z (geometric) isomers exist.

    # Counting the unique carbon environments based on symmetry:
    # - Environment 1: The two carbons of the central double bond (=C<) are equivalent.
    # - Environment 2: The four methylene carbons (-CH2-) of the ethyl groups are equivalent.
    # - Environment 3: The four terminal methyl carbons (-CH3) of the ethyl groups are equivalent.
