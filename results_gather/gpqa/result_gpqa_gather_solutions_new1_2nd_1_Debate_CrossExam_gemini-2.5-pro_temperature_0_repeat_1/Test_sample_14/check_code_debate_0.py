def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by recalculating the physics problem.

    The problem asks to compare the transit probabilities of two planets.
    - Transit probability (p) is proportional to R_s / a, where R_s is the stellar radius
      and 'a' is the semi-major axis.
    - Kepler's Third Law states P^2 is proportional to a^3 / M_s, where P is the orbital
      period and M_s is the stellar mass.

    From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:
    - R_s1 = R_s2 (Stellar radii are equal)
    - P_1 = P_2 / 3  => P_2 / P_1 = 3
    - M_s1 = 2 * M_s2 => M_s1 / M_s2 = 2

    # Since R_s1 = R_s2, this simplifies to:
    # p1 / p2 = a2 / a1

    # --- Step 2: Formulate the semi-major axis ratio using Kepler's Law ---
    # From Kepler's Law, a is proportional to (M_s * P^2)^(1/3).
    # So, a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)

    # a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 / M_s1) * (P_2 / P_1)^2 ]^(1/3)
