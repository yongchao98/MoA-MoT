    This function solves the quantum mechanics problem from scratch and verifies the provided answer.
    
    The problem involves:
    1. Normalizing a given quantum state |alpha>.
    2. Finding the eigenvalues and eigenstates of a given operator A.
    3. Calculating the probabilities of measuring the system in each eigenstate.
    4. Calculating the average (expectation) value of the operator A.
    5. Comparing these calculated values with the values from the selected answer option.
