    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the astrophysics question.

    The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift (z) for a Lyman-alpha (Lyα)
    absorption line to be detected by a ground-based optical telescope.

    Key principles:
    1. Redshift formula: λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)
    2. Lyα rest wavelength (λ_rest) is ~1216 Angstroms.
    3. Ground-based optical telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which
       blocks UV light. The "atmospheric cutoff" is the minimum wavelength that can
       be detected. A standard value for this physical limit is ~3500 Angstroms.
    4. The question asks for the "lower limit", meaning the smallest redshift among
       the options that allows for detection.
