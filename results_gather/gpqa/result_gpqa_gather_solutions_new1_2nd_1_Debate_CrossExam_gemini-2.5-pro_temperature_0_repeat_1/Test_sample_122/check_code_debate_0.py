def check_special_relativity_distance():
    """
    This function verifies the answer to a special relativity problem involving time dilation.

    The problem asks for the distance traveled by a supernova ejecta in the Galaxy's 
    reference frame, given the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame.

    It checks the following:
    1.  The core physics calculation using the time dilation formula.
    2.  A logical constraint: the relativistic distance must be greater than the 
        non-relativistic (classical) distance.
    3.  Whether the provided answer corresponds to the option closest to the calculated value.
