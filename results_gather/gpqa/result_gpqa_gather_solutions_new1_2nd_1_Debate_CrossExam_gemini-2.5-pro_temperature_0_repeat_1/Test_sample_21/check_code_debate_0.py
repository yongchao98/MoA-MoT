def check_electrochemistry_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the electrochemistry question.

    The function verifies two main points:
    1.  Thermodynamics: Compares the standard reduction potential of oxygen in basic vs. acidic solutions to determine its relative strength as an oxidant.
    2.  Kinetics: Assesses the known reaction rate of oxygen reduction in acidic solutions.

    It then compares the derived correct answer with the LLM's provided answer.
