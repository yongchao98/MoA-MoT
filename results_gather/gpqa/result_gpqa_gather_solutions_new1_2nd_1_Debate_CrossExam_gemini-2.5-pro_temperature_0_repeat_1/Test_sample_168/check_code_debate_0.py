Here is a step-by-step analysis of the physics problem to determine the final answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the Nature of the Energy Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete)

The first step is to determine whether the energy spectrum of the `E` particles remains continuous or becomes discrete in the variant decay.

*   **Principle of Multi-Body Decays**: In particle physics, when a decay results in three or more particles in the final state, the total energy released is shared among them. This sharing can happen in a continuous range of ways while still conserving total energy and momentum. Consequently, the kinetic energy of any single product (or a subset of products) is not fixed and will form a continuous spectrum. A discrete spectrum (a sharp energy peak) only occurs in two-body decays, where the energies are uniquely determined.

*   **Original Decay (`2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`)**: The final state consists of the recoiling nucleus (containing the 2B nucleons), two E particles, and two V particles. This is a multi-body final state. As the problem states, this results in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles.

*   **Variant Decay (`2A -> 2B + 2E + M`)**: The final state consists of the recoiling nucleus, two E particles, and the single M particle. This is also a multi-body final state. The total energy released will be shared between the E particles and the M particle. Since the M particle can carry away a variable amount of kinetic energy, the energy remaining for the E particles must also be variable.

*   **Conclusion 1**: The energy spectrum of the E particles **remains continuous**. This conclusion eliminates options B and C, which state the spectrum becomes discrete.

### Step 2: Analyze the Endpoint of the Energy Spectrum (Increases vs. Decreases)

The second step is to determine how the maximum energy of the E particles (the endpoint of the spectrum) changes.

*   **Principle of Q-value**: The endpoint of the kinetic energy spectrum is determined by the total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value. The Q-value is calculated from the difference between the total rest mass of the initial particles and the total rest mass of the final particles, according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, `E = mc²`.
    `Q (Kinetic Energy Released) = (Mass_initial - Mass_final) * c²`

*   **Calculating the Endpoints**:
    *   Let's define the initial rest mass as `m_initial = m(2A)`.
    *   For the **original decay**, the final rest mass is `m_final_orig = m(2B) + 2*m(E) + 2*m(V)`. The problem describes `V` as a "much lighter particle," which, in contrast to the "massless" particle `M`, implies `V` has a small but non-zero rest mass (`m(V) > 0`).
    *   For the **variant decay**, the final rest mass is `m_final_var = m(2B) + 2*m(E) + m(M)`. The problem explicitly states that `M` is **massless**, so `m(M) = 0`.

*   **Comparison**:
    The endpoint of the original decay is `Q_orig = (m_initial - m_final_orig) * c²`.
    The endpoint of the variant decay is `Q_var = (m_initial - m_final_var) * c²`.

    The difference in endpoints is due to the difference in final rest masses:
    `Q_var - Q_orig = (m_final_orig - m_final_var) * c²`
    `Q_var - Q_orig = ([m(2B) + 2*m(E) + 2*m(V)] - [m(2B) + 2*m(E) + 0]) * c²`
    `Q_var - Q_orig = 2 * m(V) * c²`

    Since `m(V)` is a positive mass, the term `2 * m(V) * c²` is a positive amount of energy. This means `Q_var` is greater than `Q_orig`.

*   **Conclusion 2**: The endpoint of the energy spectrum **increases**. In the variant decay, the energy that would have been converted into the rest mass of the two V particles is now available as additional kinetic energy for the final products, raising the maximum possible energy for the E particles.

### Final Decision

Combining the conclusions from both steps:
1.  The spectrum **remains continuous**.
2.  The endpoint **increases**.

This corresponds to option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while nearly all of them correctly deduce these two physical points, they frequently map them to the wrong letter, indicating a flaw in their final selection process rather than their physical reasoning. The correct physical analysis points unambiguously to D.
