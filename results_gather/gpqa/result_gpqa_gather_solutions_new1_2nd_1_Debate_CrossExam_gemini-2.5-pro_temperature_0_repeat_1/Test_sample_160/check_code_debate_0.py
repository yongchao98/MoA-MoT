    # --- Step 1: Define the relationship between λ1 and λ2 ---
    # From kinetic theory:
    # λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)  (gas-gas collisions)
    # λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)          (electron-gas collisions, gas is stationary)

    #
    # The ratio is therefore:
    # λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]

    # The critical physical insight is that for high-energy (1000 keV) electrons,
    # the scattering cross-section (σ_eg) is much smaller than the kinetic
    # cross-section between two gas molecules (σ_gg).
    # This means the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) must be greater than 1.
    # Let's call this `cross_section_ratio`.
    # Constraint: cross_section_ratio > 1

    # We can test this logic by assuming a plausible value for the ratio that satisfies the constraint.
