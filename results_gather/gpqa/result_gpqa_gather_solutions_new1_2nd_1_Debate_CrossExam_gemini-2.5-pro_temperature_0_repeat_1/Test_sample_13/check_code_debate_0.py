The 'repeats' hypothesis (Option C) better incorporates the specific biology of IKAROS and provides a more direct mechanism (insolubility) for complete signal loss."

    # Option C: At repeats
    # Strength 1 (Insolubility): IKAROS binds to dense, repetitive heterochromatin. Strong cross-linking can make these regions insoluble and lost during sample prep.
    # Strength 2 (Artifact removal): Stronger fixation enhances true signals, causing weaker artifactual signals at repeats to fall below the analysis threshold.
