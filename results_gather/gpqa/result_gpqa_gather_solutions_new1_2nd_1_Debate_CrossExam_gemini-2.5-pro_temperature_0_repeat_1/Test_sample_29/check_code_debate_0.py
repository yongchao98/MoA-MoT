def check_textile_dye_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the textile dye problem.

    The function follows these steps:
    1.  Calculates the wavelength of the emitted light from the given energy.
    2.  Applies the Stokes Shift principle: absorbed wavelength must be shorter than emitted wavelength.
    3.  Filters the provided options to find all candidates that satisfy this principle.
    4.  Among the valid candidates, identifies the most plausible one (the one with the highest wavelength, i.e., closest in energy to the emission).
    5.  Compares this calculated correct answer with the provided answer.
