def check_reaction_outcome():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the reaction of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol with bromine.
    
    The function codifies the following chemical principles:
    1.  The reaction of an enol with a halogen (Br2) is predominantly alpha-halogenation.
    2.  This reaction results in an alpha-halo ketone, not a dihalo-alcohol (addition product).
    3.  For 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, the alpha-carbon (adjacent to the C-OH in the double bond) is C2.
    4.  Therefore, the major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.
    5.  Bromination at C4 is mechanistically infeasible as it's a quaternary carbon.
