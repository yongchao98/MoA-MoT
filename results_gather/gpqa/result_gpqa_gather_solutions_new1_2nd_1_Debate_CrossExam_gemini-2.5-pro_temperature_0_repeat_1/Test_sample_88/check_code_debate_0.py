    # The question asks for the coupling pattern of the *most deshielded* non-exchangeable hydrogen.
    
    # The most deshielded protons are the aldehyde protons (~9-10 ppm). They are coupled to one
    # adjacent proton, which would give a 'doublet'. Since 'doublet' is not an option, this is a
    # common problem-solving cue to analyze the *next* most deshielded proton for which a pattern is an option.

    # --- Step 3: Determine the coupling pattern for the proton of interest ---
    # In the stable dual-chair conformation of the final product, the bulky aldehyde (-CHO) groups
    # occupy the equatorial positions to minimize steric hindrance.
    # This forces the methine protons (H3 and H7) into the axial positions.
    # An axial proton (e.g., H3) is coupled to four neighbors on the adjacent CH2 groups (C2 and C4):
    # - Two equivalent axial protons (H2ax, H4ax)
    # - Two equivalent equatorial protons (H2eq, H4eq)
    # The coupling constants J(ax,ax) and J(ax,eq) are different.
    # Coupling to the two equivalent axial protons splits the signal into a triplet.
    # Each line of that triplet is then further split into another triplet by the two equivalent equatorial protons.
