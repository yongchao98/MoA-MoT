    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct solution.

    ### Step 1: Account for Cosmological Redshift
    The observation is of a structure at a distance of 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc). This is a vast cosmological distance, which means the light traveling from it has been stretched by the expansion of the universe. This effect, known as redshift (z), reduces the observed energy of the light compared to the energy it had when it was emitted (the "rest-frame energy"). To identify the phenomenon as it would appear in our own galaxy (at z≈0), we must first calculate this rest-frame energy.

    *   **Calculation:**
        1.  We can estimate the redshift using the Hubble-Lemaître Law (`v = H₀ * d`). Using a standard value for the Hubble constant, H₀ ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc, for a distance of 2.1 Gpc (2100 Mpc), the recessional velocity is `v ≈ 70 * 2100 = 147,000 km/s`.
        2.  The redshift `z` is `v/c`, which is approximately `147,000 / 300,000 ≈ 0.49`.
        3.  The rest-frame energy (`E_rest`) is found using the formula `E_rest = E_observed * (1 + z)`.
        4.  `E_rest = 3.9 µeV * (1 + 0.49) = 3.9 µeV * 1.49 ≈ 5.81 µeV`.

    *   **Careful Point 1:** The distance being measured in gigaparsecs is the critical clue that a redshift correction is not just optional, but mandatory for correctly identifying the spectral line.

    ### Step 2: Identify the Spectral Line
    The calculated rest-frame energy of approximately 5.81 µeV must be matched to a known physical transition.

    *   **Identification:** This energy is an extremely close match for the famous **21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I)**. This line is caused by a hyperfine "spin-flip" transition in the ground state of hydrogen atoms and has a precise energy of about 5.87 µeV. The small difference between the calculated and actual value is due to using an approximate value for the Hubble constant.

    *   **Careful Point 2:** The extremely low energy scale (micro-electron volts) strongly suggests a low-energy transition like the 21-cm line, rather than much higher-energy electronic or molecular transitions.

    ### Step 3: Determine the Component of the Interstellar Medium (ISM)
    Now that the line is identified as the 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen, we must determine which phase of the ISM it traces under the given conditions.

    *   **Careful Point 3: Atomic vs. Molecular.** The 21-cm line originates from **atomic** hydrogen. This is a fundamental point that immediately rules out the options involving the molecular interstellar medium (A and B). The choice is now between the warm atomic and cold atomic medium.

    *   **Careful Point 4: Absorption vs. Emission.** The problem explicitly states that an **absorption line** was detected. This is the final and most decisive piece of information. An absorption line is formed when a cooler gas lies in front of a hotter, brighter background source. The strength of the 21-cm absorption is inversely proportional to the temperature of the gas.
        *   The **Warm Atomic Medium** (~8000 K) is too hot to produce strong absorption features and is primarily studied through its own broad 21-cm *emission*.
        *   The **Cold Atomic Medium** (~100 K), being much colder and denser, is the ideal environment for creating strong, narrow 21-cm *absorption* lines.

    ### Conclusion
    The logical chain is unambiguous:
    1.  The observed energy, when corrected for redshift, corresponds to the 21-cm line.
    2.  The 21-cm line is a feature of **atomic** hydrogen.
    3.  Observing this line in **absorption** is a classic signature of the **cold** phase of the atomic interstellar medium.

    Therefore, the correct answer is the Cold atomic interstellar medium.
