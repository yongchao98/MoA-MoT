  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nSubstance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\n\nA) 35\nB) 25\nC) 29\nD) 31\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe Python script successfully executed the plan to solve the chemical puzzle.\n\n*   **Hypothesis Generation:** The script started by identifying two plausible candidates for Substance X, a deuterated reducing agent: Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n\n*   **Constraint Application & Pruning:** The script then applied the constraints from the problem description:\n    1.  The melting point of substance B (~277 K) identifies it as heavy water (D₂O).\n    2.  The properties of gas W (equal protons and neutrons) identify it as deuterium gas (D₂).\n    3.  The formation of a precipitate (G) is the key differentiator. The script correctly determined that LiAlD₄ reacts with D₂O to form a precipitate of aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), while NaBD₄ forms soluble products. This eliminated NaBD₄ as a candidate.\n    4.  The final clue, regarding the reduction of a keto acid, confirms the choice of LiAlD₄, a strong reducing agent.\n\n*   **Final Choice & Calculation:** With LiAlD₄ as the sole surviving candidate, the script proceeded to the final calculation.\n    *   Substance X: LiAlD₄\n    *   Constituent elements by mass: Al (27), Li (7), D (2).\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Al).\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The cumulative mass was calculated by summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements: (1 × mass of Al) + (4 × mass of D) = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance B\nThe first clue is that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value 277 K is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Gas W\nGas W is released in the reaction, and its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given that heavy water is involved, the most logical candidate for the gas is deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A deuterium atom (D or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Substance X and the Reaction\n*   **Clue 1**: Substance X contains a heavier isotope. The identification of D₂O and D₂ confirms this isotope is deuterium.\n*   **Clue 2**: Substance X and its close analog are common reagents in organic chemistry. A very powerful and common reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, is a perfect candidate for Substance X.\n*   **Clue 3**: X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be violent and produce the correct gas. Let's assume Y is D₂O.\n    *   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   **Clue 4**: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). In the proposed reaction, the precipitate G is Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (since aluminum hydroxide is a precipitate). The thermal decomposition of Al(OD)₃ is 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O (B), which is consistent with all clues.\n\n### Step 4: Verify with the Final Clue\nThe product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n*   A keto acid contains both a ketone functional group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both of these groups to alcohols (-OH).\n*   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄). We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest element**: Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   **Heaviest element**: Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   **Masses of relevant atoms in the molecule (using integer mass numbers)**:\n    *   There are four atoms of the lightest element's isotope, Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2.\n    *   There is one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Cumulative sum = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. Converting this to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is extremely close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Therefore, Substance B is heavy water.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released in the reaction, and its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Given that heavy water is involved, the heavy isotope is deuterium (D). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) would therefore have 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Substance X contains a heavier isotope, which we've identified as deuterium (D).\n    *   Its analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent. Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X.\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent. To produce the identified products, the reaction must be between LiAlD₄ and heavy water (D₂O). Thus, liquid Y is D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is: **LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)**.\n    *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (G), as aluminum hydroxide is insoluble.\n    *   When the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes to release heavy water (B): **2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)**. This matches all the clues.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Keto Acid Clue:** The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both of these functional groups to alcohols (-OH). The resulting product is a diol (containing two alcohol groups), which has exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms the identity of Substance X as LiAlD₄.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using their mass numbers.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value 277 K is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas W**\nThe gas W, released during the reaction, has a molecule containing an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given the involvement of heavy water, deuterium gas (D₂) is a prime candidate.\n*   A deuterium atom (D, or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly.\n*   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**3. Identification of Substance X and the Reaction**\n*   **Clue 1:** Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". The identification of D₂O and D₂ strongly implies this isotope is deuterium.\n*   **Clue 2:** Substance X and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\". A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits this description perfectly.\n*   **Clue 3:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, producing gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be violent and follows the equation:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   This reaction produces the correct gas (W = D₂). It also produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is analogous to the known precipitate aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃. So, **G is Al(OD)₃** and **Y is D₂O**.\n*   **Clue 4:** When precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it releases B (D₂O). The thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) yields a metal oxide and water (or heavy water): 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This is consistent with all findings.\n*   **Clue 5:** The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. A keto acid contains both a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both groups to alcohols (-CH(OH)- and -CH₂OH). The resulting product, a diol, contains exactly two oxygen atoms, confirming the identity of X.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecular formula. We use the integer mass numbers for the relevant isotopes.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of the deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains one atom of aluminum. The stable isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   Total Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Deuterium atoms) + (Mass from Aluminum atom)\n    *   Total Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value 277 K is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nGas W is released during the reaction, and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n*   Given that we've identified D₂O, the presence of deuterium is a key theme. Let's examine deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A single deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   A D₂ molecule therefore has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly fits the description (protons = neutrons).\n*   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X and the Reaction**\nWe have several clues about Substance X and its reaction:\n*   It contains a heavier isotope (which we now know is deuterium, D).\n*   Its close analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n*   It reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G.\n*   Precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This suggests G is a deuterated metal hydroxide, like M(OD)ₓ.\n*   A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues for Substance X.\n*   Let's test this hypothesis. The reaction of LiAlD₄ (X) with heavy water, D₂O (Y), would be:\n    **LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂**\n*   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W). It also produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a precipitate (G), analogous to the insoluble aluminum hydroxide. Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause it to decompose and release D₂O (B), which is consistent with the clues.\n\n**Step 4: Verify with the Final Clue**\nThe product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n*   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n*   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both functional groups to alcohols. The ketone becomes a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid becomes a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   The final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass**\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum is 27.\n    *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is given as \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W**: The gas W has a molecule containing an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Given the context of heavy water, the most logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, satisfying the condition.\n    *   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and the Reaction**:\n    *   The problem states that Substance X contains a heavier isotope, which we've identified as deuterium (D).\n    *   It is also mentioned that X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms, while the resulting diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)) has 2 oxygen atoms. This clue strongly supports X being a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n    *   The reaction described is X reacting violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) is violent and follows this equation:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (G), which is analogous to the known precipitate aluminum hydroxide.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose, releasing heavy water (B): 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n    *   All clues are consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**:\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Based on atomic number, the **lightest element is Hydrogen** and the **heaviest element is Aluminum**.\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula unit, using integer mass numbers.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope.

Analysis of the Chemical Puzzle**\n\nA strong consensus exists among the detailed candidate answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15) regarding the identity of the substances involved. The reasoning is consistent and sound:\n*   **Substance B:** Its melting point of ~277 K is a near-perfect match for heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 276.97 K.\n*   **Gas W:** A molecule with an equal number of protons and neutrons, in the context of a reaction involving deuterium, is almost certainly deuterium gas (D₂), which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Substance X:** The clues point overwhelmingly to **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope (Deuterium, D).\n    *   Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n    *   It reacts violently with water (or in this case, heavy water, D₂O, which is liquid Y).\n    *   The reaction LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂ produces the correct gas (W=D₂) and a precipitate (G=Al(OD)₃).\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) releases substance B (D₂O).\n    *   LiAlD₄ reduces a keto acid to a diol, a product with two oxygen atoms, matching the final clue.\n\n**2.

Using the integer mass number, the total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Al. Using the integer mass number, the total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Candidate Answers and Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated result is unequivocally 35. The provided options are:\nA) 25\nB) 31\nC) 29\nD) 35\n\n*   A significant number of candidate answers (1, 2, 4, 9, 11) correctly calculate 35 but incorrectly select option C. Others (3, 6, 12, 15) calculate 35 but select option A.

This corresponds to option D. The errors in the other candidate answers are clerical, not logical.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the chemical puzzle and a review of the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B**: The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   The proximity of 276.97 K to 277 K is a clear indicator that **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W**: Gas W is released in the reaction, and its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Considering the involvement of deuterium from D₂O, the most logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description (protons = neutrons). Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and the Reaction**:\n    *   **Clue**: Substance X contains a heavier isotope (which we've identified as deuterium) and its analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n    *   **Inference**: A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits this description perfectly.\n    *   **Clue**: X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G.\n    *   **Inference**: The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be violent and produce D₂ gas. Let's assume Y is D₂O. The reaction is:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G), as its non-deuterated analog Al(OH)₃ is a known precipitate.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Identities of G and B**:\n    *   **Clue**: Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\n    *   **Inference**: The thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide yields a metal oxide and water. Similarly, heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose and release heavy water B (D₂O): 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This confirms the identities of G and B.\n\n5.  **Verify with the Final Clue**:\n    *   **Clue**: The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n    *   **Inference**: A keto acid contains both a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both functional groups to alcohols. The resulting product is a diol (containing two -OH groups), which has exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This final clue confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest element**: Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   **Heaviest element**: Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula. We use the integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium (D or ²H) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum)**: The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative Sum**:\n    *   Total = (Mass from all H isotopes) + (Mass from all Al isotopes)\n    *   Total = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many correctly deduce the logic, several make a mistake in the final step of selecting the option. The correct reasoning consistently leads to the value 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   This is an excellent match, so we can confidently identify **Substance B as heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nGas W is released during the reaction, and its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given the involvement of D₂O, a likely candidate is deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   We can identify **Gas W as deuterium gas (D₂)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X and the Reaction**\n*   **Clue 1:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope. The identification of D₂O and D₂ strongly suggests this isotope is deuterium.\n*   **Clue 2:** Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A prominent and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, perfectly fits the description of Substance X.\n*   **Clue 3:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be violent and proceed as follows:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃), as aluminum hydroxide is insoluble. This confirms that **Liquid Y is D₂O** and **Precipitate G is Al(OD)₃**.\n*   **Clue 4:** When precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it releases B (D₂O). The thermal decomposition of aluminum deuteroxide is: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This is consistent with all findings.\n\n**Step 4: Verify with the Final Clue**\nThe product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n*   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n*   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both functional groups to alcohols (>CH-OH and -CH₂-OH).\n*   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This final clue confirms the identity of **Substance X as LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula unit, using integer mass numbers.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Chemical Clues**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is stated to be \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen (deuterium, D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Given that a heavy isotope of hydrogen (deuterium) is involved, let's examine deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Substance X contains a heavier isotope (which we've identified as deuterium, D).\n    *   Substance X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits this description perfectly.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The problem states X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The most logical reactant to produce deuterated products is heavy water, D₂O. So, **Liquid Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W).\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W). It also produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is analogous to the insoluble aluminum hydroxide, and would thus be the **precipitate G**.\n    *   The clue states that heating precipitate G releases substance B. Heating aluminum deuteroxide would cause it to decompose: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O, which we identified as substance B. All these points are consistent.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Keto Acid Clue:**\n    *   The final clue states that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both of these functional groups to alcohols (-OH).\n    *   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms the identity of **Substance X as LiAlD₄**.\n\n### **Calculation**\n\nThe task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n1.  **Identify Elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope, Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n3.  **Sum the Masses:** The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the formula unit. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Deuterium atoms) + (Total mass from Aluminum atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided information. The goal is to model the task using constraints to prune the search space and arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n### Constraint Analysis and Deduction\n\n1.  **Constraint 1: Identity of Substance B**\n    *   **Clue:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   **Analysis:** 277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The match is nearly perfect. **Substance B is D₂O**. This immediately introduces the concept of deuterium into the problem.\n\n2.  **Constraint 2: Identity of Gas W**\n    *   **Clue:** Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Analysis:** Given that deuterium is present (from B=D₂O), the most logical candidate for W is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This fits the constraint perfectly. **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Constraint 3: The Reaction and Identity of G**\n    *   **Clue:** X + Y → W (D₂) + G (precipitate). Also, heating G releases B (D₂O).\n    *   **Analysis:** For a reaction to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate (G) that can be decomposed by heat to yield D₂O, the reactants must be a deuterated compound (X) and a liquid that provides the necessary components (Y). The most logical candidate for Y is D₂O, which is a liquid. The precipitate G must be a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The reaction involves a deuterated compound X reacting with D₂O (Y) to form a deuterated hydroxide precipitate (G) and D₂ gas (W).\n\n4.  **Constraint 4: Identity of Substance X**\n    *   **Clue 1:** X contains a heavier isotope (confirmed to be deuterium).\n    *   **Clue 2:** X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.\n    *   **Clue 3:** The reaction of a keto acid with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Hypothesis Generation & Pruning:** Common deuterated reagents used in organic chemistry include Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄) and Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n        *   **Candidate 1: NaBD₄.** Reaction with D₂O: `NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. The products, sodium deuteroxide and boric deuteroxide, are soluble. This does not form a precipitate (G). This candidate is eliminated.\n        *   **Candidate 2: LiAlD₄.** Reaction with D₂O: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is the analog of insoluble aluminum hydroxide, so it would form a precipitate (G). This candidate is valid.\n    *   **Verification:**\n        *   The analog of LiAlD₄ is LiAlH₄, a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. This fits Clue 2.\n        *   A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. A strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄ reduces both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols, yielding a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This fits Clue 3.\n    *   **Conclusion:** All constraints are satisfied. **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen.\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum.\n*   **Instruction:** Sum the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula. We use integer mass numbers, which is standard for this type of problem.\n    *   **Mass from Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = **35**.\n\nThis calculated value of 35 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify Substance B**\n*   The clue states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n**2. Identify Gas W**\n*   The clue states that the molecule of gas W contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given that heavy water is involved, a likely candidate for the gas is deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A single deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the clue perfectly. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**3. Identify Substance X and the Reaction**\n*   **Clue 1:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope. The identification of D₂O and D₂ strongly suggests this isotope is deuterium.\n*   **Clue 2:** Substance X and its close analog are common reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X.\n*   **Clue 3:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be violent and produce the correct gas. Let's assume liquid Y is D₂O.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   **Clue 4:** A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\n    *   In the proposed reaction, Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is formed. Analogous to aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, it is a precipitate. This matches G.\n    *   Heating a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes it to decompose into a metal oxide and water (or heavy water). The reaction 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O confirms that heating G releases B.\n\n**4.

Perform the Final Calculation**\n*   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   Based on atomic number, the **lightest element is Hydrogen** and the **heaviest element is Aluminum**.\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the formula unit. We use integer mass numbers for this type of problem.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al).

A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly perform the chemical analysis and calculation to arrive at the number 35, they frequently make an error in matching this number to the correct letter option. The correct calculation leads to 35, which is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance B\nThe first clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value 277 K is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Gas W\nThe gas W, released during the reaction, is described as having a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given that heavy water (D₂O) has been identified, the heavy isotope involved is deuterium (D). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   A molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) would consist of two deuterium atoms.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description (protons = neutrons). This makes **Gas W = D₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Substance X and the Reaction\nWe can now piece together the reaction.\n*   **Clue:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope (which we know is D) and its close analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry. A prime candidate for such a reagent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a powerful and widely used reducing agent. Its deuterated analog would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Clue:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be violent and produce the correct gas. Let's assume Y is D₂O.\n*   **Proposed Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   **Clue:** A precipitate G is formed. In the products, aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is a known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**, would also be a precipitate. This fits the role of G.\n*   **Clue:** Heating precipitate G releases substance B (D₂O). The thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) yields a metal oxide and water (or heavy water). The reaction 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O is consistent with this clue.\n\n### Step 4: Verify with the Final Clue\nThe final clue states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) yields a product with two oxygen atoms.\n*   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of three oxygen atoms in the functional groups.\n*   LiAlD₄ (like LiAlH₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both of these functional groups to alcohols (-OH).\n*   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms the identity of **Substance X as LiAlD₄**.\n\n### Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope, Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all atoms* of these two elements in the molecule. We use the integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the Deuterium (D or ²H) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The stable isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n    *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of masses = 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify Substance B and the Isotope**\n\nThe first critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is essential to convert this temperature to Celsius to compare it with known melting points of water.\n*   **Calculation:** 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   **Analysis:** The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   **Conclusion:** The match is nearly perfect. **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**. This immediately establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is deuterium (D).\n\n### **Step 2: Identify Gas W**\n\nThe molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This clue must be evaluated in the context of the elements we know are present, especially deuterium.\n*   **Analysis:** A deuterium atom (D, or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron. A molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) would therefore contain 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Conclusion:** The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify Substance X**\n\nThis is the central part of the puzzle, and multiple clues must be synthesized.\n\n*   **Clue A:** Substance X contains deuterium.\n*   **Clue B:** Its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\".\n*   **Clue C:** It reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ (W) and a precipitate (G).\n*   **Clue D:** The product of its reaction with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Analysis (Synthesizing Clues A, B, and C):** Common powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry include Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated analogs are Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). We must test which one forms a precipitate upon reaction. The reaction is violent and produces D₂, so the liquid Y is almost certainly D₂O.\n    *   **Hypothesis 1 (X = LiAlD₄):** The reaction is `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a known precipitate, so its analog Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate (G). This hypothesis is consistent with the clues.\n    *   **Hypothesis 2 (X = NaBD₄):** The reaction is `NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. The products, sodium deuteroxide and boric acid/deuteroxide, are soluble in water. This does not form a precipitate. This hypothesis is incorrect.\n\n*   **Analysis (Verifying with Clue D):** A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both functional groups to alcohols (-OH). The resulting product is a diol, which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms the identity.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** All clues converge on one identity. **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The question specifies summing the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements, not just one of each.\n*   **Identify Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Sum the Masses:** We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = **35**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical analysis and calculation consistently lead to the numerical answer of 35. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\nA) 35\nB) 25\nC) 29\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The melting point of substance B (~277 K) identifies it as heavy water (D₂O).\n    2.  The properties of gas W (equal protons and neutrons) identify it as deuterium gas (D₂).\n    3.

Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Gas W\nGas W is released in the reaction, and its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given that heavy water is involved, the most logical candidate for the gas is deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A deuterium atom (D or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Substance X and the Reaction\n*   **Clue 1**: Substance X contains a heavier isotope. The identification of D₂O and D₂ confirms this isotope is deuterium.\n*   **Clue 2**: Substance X and its close analog are common reagents in organic chemistry. A very powerful and common reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, is a perfect candidate for Substance X.\n*   **Clue 3**: X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be violent and produce the correct gas. Let's assume Y is D₂O.\n    *   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   **Clue 4**: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). In the proposed reaction, the precipitate G is Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (since aluminum hydroxide is a precipitate). The thermal decomposition of Al(OD)₃ is 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O (B), which is consistent with all clues.\n\n### Step 4: Verify with the Final Clue\nThe product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n*   A keto acid contains both a ketone functional group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both of these groups to alcohols (-OH).\n*   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄). We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest element**: Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   **Heaviest element**: Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   **Masses of relevant atoms in the molecule (using integer mass numbers)**:\n    *   There are four atoms of the lightest element's isotope, Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2.\n    *   There is one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Cumulative sum = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. Converting this to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is extremely close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Therefore, Substance B is heavy water.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released in the reaction, and its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Given that heavy water is involved, the heavy isotope is deuterium (D). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) would therefore have 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Substance X contains a heavier isotope, which we've identified as deuterium (D).\n    *   Its analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent. Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X.\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent. To produce the identified products, the reaction must be between LiAlD₄ and heavy water (D₂O). Thus, liquid Y is D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is: **LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)**.\n    *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (G), as aluminum hydroxide is insoluble.\n    *   When the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes to release heavy water (B): **2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)**. This matches all the clues.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Keto Acid Clue:** The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both of these functional groups to alcohols (-OH). The resulting product is a diol (containing two alcohol groups), which has exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms the identity of Substance X as LiAlD₄.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using their mass numbers.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value 277 K is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas W**\nThe gas W, released during the reaction, has a molecule containing an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given the involvement of heavy water, deuterium gas (D₂) is a prime candidate.\n*   A deuterium atom (D, or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly.\n*   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**3. Identification of Substance X and the Reaction**\n*   **Clue 1:** Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". The identification of D₂O and D₂ strongly implies this isotope is deuterium.\n*   **Clue 2:** Substance X and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\". A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits this description perfectly.\n*   **Clue 3:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, producing gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be violent and follows the equation:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   This reaction produces the correct gas (W = D₂). It also produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is analogous to the known precipitate aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃. So, **G is Al(OD)₃** and **Y is D₂O**.\n*   **Clue 4:** When precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it releases B (D₂O). The thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) yields a metal oxide and water (or heavy water): 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This is consistent with all findings.\n*   **Clue 5:** The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. A keto acid contains both a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both groups to alcohols (-CH(OH)- and -CH₂OH). The resulting product, a diol, contains exactly two oxygen atoms, confirming the identity of X.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecular formula. We use the integer mass numbers for the relevant isotopes.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of the deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains one atom of aluminum. The stable isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   Total Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Deuterium atoms) + (Mass from Aluminum atom)\n    *   Total Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value 277 K is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nGas W is released during the reaction, and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n*   Given that we've identified D₂O, the presence of deuterium is a key theme. Let's examine deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A single deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   A D₂ molecule therefore has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly fits the description (protons = neutrons).\n*   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X and the Reaction**\nWe have several clues about Substance X and its reaction:\n*   It contains a heavier isotope (which we now know is deuterium, D).\n*   Its close analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n*   It reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G.\n*   Precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This suggests G is a deuterated metal hydroxide, like M(OD)ₓ.\n*   A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues for Substance X.\n*   Let's test this hypothesis. The reaction of LiAlD₄ (X) with heavy water, D₂O (Y), would be:\n    **LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂**\n*   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W). It also produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a precipitate (G), analogous to the insoluble aluminum hydroxide. Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause it to decompose and release D₂O (B), which is consistent with the clues.\n\n**Step 4: Verify with the Final Clue**\nThe product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n*   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n*   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both functional groups to alcohols. The ketone becomes a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid becomes a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   The final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass**\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum is 27.\n    *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is given as \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W**: The gas W has a molecule containing an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Given the context of heavy water, the most logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, satisfying the condition.\n    *   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and the Reaction**:\n    *   The problem states that Substance X contains a heavier isotope, which we've identified as deuterium (D).\n    *   It is also mentioned that X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms, while the resulting diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)) has 2 oxygen atoms. This clue strongly supports X being a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n    *   The reaction described is X reacting violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) is violent and follows this equation:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (G), which is analogous to the known precipitate aluminum hydroxide.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose, releasing heavy water (B): 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n    *   All clues are consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**:\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Based on atomic number, the **lightest element is Hydrogen** and the **heaviest element is Aluminum**.\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula unit, using integer mass numbers.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum)**: There is one atom of Aluminum (Al).

Identify Substance B**\n*   The problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value 276.97 K is extremely close to 277 K. Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n**2. Identify Gas W**\n*   Gas W is released in the reaction, and its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Let's consider the most likely candidate given the presence of deuterium. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   A molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) would therefore have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**3. Identify Substance X and the Reaction**\n*   **Clue 1:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope. The identification of B as D₂O and W as D₂ strongly suggests this isotope is deuterium.\n*   **Clue 2:** Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X.\n*   **Clue 3:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be violent and produce the correct gas. Let's assume Y is D₂O.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   **Clue 4:** A precipitate G forms. In the reaction above, Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is analogous to the insoluble Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, and would form a precipitate. This fits.\n*   **Clue 5:** Heating precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) releases B (D₂O). The thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) yields a metal oxide and water (or heavy water).\n    *   Decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B). This also fits perfectly.\n*   **Clue 6:** The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. A keto acid contains both a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both groups to alcohols (-OH). The resulting product, a diol, contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms the identity of X.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n*   We have confidently identified **Substance X as LiAlD₄**.\n*   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within the substance.\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   Based on atomic number (Z), the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula unit. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:**\n    *   Sum = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum)\n    *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is stated to be \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   The match is nearly perfect. Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W's molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Given that heavy water is involved, the most likely candidate is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and the Reaction:**\n    *   **Clue 1:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope. The identification of D₂O and D₂ strongly suggests this isotope is deuterium.\n    *   **Clue 2:** Substance X and its close analog are common reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X.\n    *   **Clue 3:** X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be violent and produce the correct gas:\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction produces a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), as its analog Al(OH)₃ is a known precipitate. So, **G is Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Clue 4:** Heating precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) releases substance B (D₂O). This is consistent with the thermal decomposition of a deuterated hydroxide: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n    *   **Clue 5:** The reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) produces a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. LiAlD₄ is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both groups to alcohols. The resulting product is a diol (containing two -OH groups), which has exactly 2 oxygen atoms.

Let's assume Y is D₂O. The reaction is:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G), as its non-deuterated analog Al(OH)₃ is a known precipitate.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Identities of G and B**:\n    *   **Clue**: Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\n    *   **Inference**: The thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide yields a metal oxide and water. Similarly, heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose and release heavy water B (D₂O): 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.

This confirms that **Liquid Y is D₂O** and **Precipitate G is Al(OD)₃**.\n*   **Clue 4:** When precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it releases B (D₂O). The thermal decomposition of aluminum deuteroxide is: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.

Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits this description perfectly.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The problem states X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The most logical reactant to produce deuterated products is heavy water, D₂O. So, **Liquid Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W).\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W). It also produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is analogous to the insoluble aluminum hydroxide, and would thus be the **precipitate G**.\n    *   The clue states that heating precipitate G releases substance B. Heating aluminum deuteroxide would cause it to decompose: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O, which we identified as substance B. All these points are consistent.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Keto Acid Clue:**\n    *   The final clue states that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both of these functional groups to alcohols (-OH).\n    *   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms.

The goal is to model the task using constraints to prune the search space and arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n### Constraint Analysis and Deduction\n\n1.  **Constraint 1: Identity of Substance B**\n    *   **Clue:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   **Analysis:** 277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The match is nearly perfect. **Substance B is D₂O**. This immediately introduces the concept of deuterium into the problem.\n\n2.  **Constraint 2: Identity of Gas W**\n    *   **Clue:** Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Analysis:** Given that deuterium is present (from B=D₂O), the most logical candidate for W is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This fits the constraint perfectly. **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Constraint 3: The Reaction and Identity of G**\n    *   **Clue:** X + Y → W (D₂) + G (precipitate). Also, heating G releases B (D₂O).\n    *   **Analysis:** For a reaction to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate (G) that can be decomposed by heat to yield D₂O, the reactants must be a deuterated compound (X) and a liquid that provides the necessary components (Y). The most logical candidate for Y is D₂O, which is a liquid. The precipitate G must be a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The reaction involves a deuterated compound X reacting with D₂O (Y) to form a deuterated hydroxide precipitate (G) and D₂ gas (W).\n\n4.  **Constraint 4: Identity of Substance X**\n    *   **Clue 1:** X contains a heavier isotope (confirmed to be deuterium).\n    *   **Clue 2:** X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.\n    *   **Clue 3:** The reaction of a keto acid with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Hypothesis Generation & Pruning:** Common deuterated reagents used in organic chemistry include Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄) and Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n        *   **Candidate 1: NaBD₄.** Reaction with D₂O: `NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. The products, sodium deuteroxide and boric deuteroxide, are soluble. This does not form a precipitate (G). This candidate is eliminated.\n        *   **Candidate 2: LiAlD₄.** Reaction with D₂O: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is the analog of insoluble aluminum hydroxide, so it would form a precipitate (G). This candidate is valid.\n    *   **Verification:**\n        *   The analog of LiAlD₄ is LiAlH₄, a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. This fits Clue 2.\n        *   A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. A strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄ reduces both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols, yielding a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This fits Clue 3.\n    *   **Conclusion:** All constraints are satisfied. **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen.\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum.\n*   **Instruction:** Sum the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula. We use integer mass numbers, which is standard for this type of problem.\n    *   **Mass from Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = **35**.\n\nThis calculated value of 35 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify Substance B**\n*   The clue states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n**2. Identify Gas W**\n*   The clue states that the molecule of gas W contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given that heavy water is involved, a likely candidate for the gas is deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A single deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the clue perfectly. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**3. Identify Substance X and the Reaction**\n*   **Clue 1:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope. The identification of D₂O and D₂ strongly suggests this isotope is deuterium.\n*   **Clue 2:** Substance X and its close analog are common reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X.\n*   **Clue 3:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be violent and produce the correct gas. Let's assume liquid Y is D₂O.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   **Clue 4:** A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\n    *   In the proposed reaction, Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is formed. Analogous to aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, it is a precipitate. This matches G.\n    *   Heating a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes it to decompose into a metal oxide and water (or heavy water). The reaction 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O confirms that heating G releases B.\n\n**4. Verify with the Final Clue**\n*   The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n*   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n*   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both functional groups to alcohols. The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups), which contains exactly **2 atoms of oxygen**.\n*   This final clue confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n**5. Perform the Final Calculation**\n*   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   Based on atomic number, the **lightest element is Hydrogen** and the **heaviest element is Aluminum**.\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the formula unit. We use integer mass numbers for this type of problem.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = **35**.\n\nThe calculated value is 35. Comparing this to the options:\nA) 29\nB) 35\nC) 25\nD) 31\n\nThe correct option is B. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly perform the chemical analysis and calculation to arrive at the number 35, they frequently make an error in matching this number to the correct letter option. The correct calculation leads to 35, which is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance B\nThe first clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value 277 K is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Gas W\nThe gas W, released during the reaction, is described as having a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given that heavy water (D₂O) has been identified, the heavy isotope involved is deuterium (D). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   A molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) would consist of two deuterium atoms.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description (protons = neutrons). This makes **Gas W = D₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Substance X and the Reaction\nWe can now piece together the reaction.\n*   **Clue:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope (which we know is D) and its close analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry. A prime candidate for such a reagent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a powerful and widely used reducing agent. Its deuterated analog would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Clue:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be violent and produce the correct gas. Let's assume Y is D₂O.\n*   **Proposed Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   **Clue:** A precipitate G is formed. In the products, aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is a known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**, would also be a precipitate. This fits the role of G.\n*   **Clue:** Heating precipitate G releases substance B (D₂O). The thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) yields a metal oxide and water (or heavy water). The reaction 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O is consistent with this clue.\n\n### Step 4: Verify with the Final Clue\nThe final clue states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) yields a product with two oxygen atoms.\n*   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of three oxygen atoms in the functional groups.\n*   LiAlD₄ (like LiAlH₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both of these functional groups to alcohols (-OH).\n*   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms the identity of **Substance X as LiAlD₄**.\n\n### Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope, Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all atoms* of these two elements in the molecule. We use the integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the Deuterium (D or ²H) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The stable isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n    *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of masses = 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
