    Checks the correctness of the final answer to the physics problem.
    
    The problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) given:
    - Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 0.1 nm
    - Velocity (v) = 2 * 10^8 m/s
    
    The solution involves:
    1. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)
    2. Energy-Momentum Relation: ΔE ≈ v * Δp
