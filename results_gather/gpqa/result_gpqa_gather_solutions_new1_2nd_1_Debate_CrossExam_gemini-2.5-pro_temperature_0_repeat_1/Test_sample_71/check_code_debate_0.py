Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, synthesizing the most accurate points from the provided candidate answers to determine the final, correct solution.

### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**

1.  **Step 1: Diene Generation and Formation of Product 1**
    *   **Careful Point:** The starting material "5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene" is an unusual name. However, the reaction conditions—a precursor with gem-dihalide groups and sodium iodide (NaI)—are standard for generating a reactive diene *in situ*. The most chemically plausible diene generated is **o-quinodimethane** (also known as o-xylylene). This is a common and well-understood reactive intermediate.
    *   **Reaction:** The generated o-quinodimethane acts as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (the dienophile).
    *   **Careful Point:** The use of **2 equivalents** of the diene precursor is a critical piece of information. It indicates that a **double Diels-Alder reaction** occurs, where one molecule of o-quinodimethane adds to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative. This forms a large, polycyclic bis-adduct, **Product 1**.

2.  **Step 2: Deprotection to Form Product 2**
    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).
    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the C7 bridge is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH), yielding the corresponding alcohol, **Product 2**.

3.  **Step 3: Oxidation to Form Product 3**
    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃•pyridine in DMSO).
    *   **Analysis:** This is a mild oxidation that converts the secondary alcohol at C7 into a ketone (C=O). The resulting molecule is **Product 3**, a complex polycyclic ketone.

4.  **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition and Formation of Final Product 4**
    *   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C. This induces a **double retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, causing the molecule to fragment.
    *   **Initial Fragments:** The fragmentation regenerates the constituent parts:
        *   Two molecules of the diene, **o-quinodimethane**.
        *   One molecule of the oxidized dienophile, **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one** (also known as 7-oxonorbornadiene).
    *   **Careful Point (Fate of Fragments):** Both of these fragments are highly reactive and will not be the final isolated products. The final product "4" is the result of their subsequent, rapid reactions.
        *   7-oxonorbornadiene is known to be thermally unstable and rapidly undergoes a cheletropic elimination to extrude a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.
        *   The two molecules of o-quinodimethane, being highly reactive and generated in close proximity, will react further. There are two primary, well-documented fates for o-quinodimethane under these conditions.

### **Identifying Product 4 and Analyzing its Symmetry**

The crucial step is to determine the structure of the stable organic product derived from the o-quinodimethane intermediate. Multiple chemically sound pathways converge on the same answer.

*   **Pathway A: Dimerization of o-quinodimethane.** The two molecules of o-quinodimethane react with each other. The major thermal product is **dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctadiene**, formed via a [4+4] cycloaddition.
    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** This molecule is not planar and adopts a stable, puckered conformation with **C₂ symmetry**. A C₂ axis relates the two halves of the molecule, but there are no mirror planes.
    *   **Hydrogen Count:** The C₂ symmetry results in 4 distinct types of aromatic hydrogens and 4 distinct types of aliphatic (benzylic) hydrogens. The total is 4 + 4 = **8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**.

*   **Pathway B: Trapping of an Intermediate.** An alternative, kinetically plausible pathway is that one molecule of the generated o-quinodimethane "traps" the 7-oxonorbornadiene intermediate in a new Diels-Alder reaction before the latter can decompose.
    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The resulting adduct possesses a **Cₛ plane of symmetry** that passes through the carbonyl group.
    *   **Hydrogen Count:** A careful analysis of the protons in this Cₛ-symmetric structure also reveals a total of **8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**.

### **Conclusion**

Both of the most chemically sound and plausible pathways for the formation of the final stable organic product, "4", lead to a molecule with **8** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This convergence from multiple valid lines of reasoning provides very strong confidence in the result. According to the options provided in the question, the number 8 corresponds to option C.
