    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of the Reaction:**\n    The problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B is heated, producing a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes, and the change in weight of the tubes tells us what gases were produced and in what quantities.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n        *   The weight increase is 3.60 g. Therefore, the mass of H₂O produced is 3.60 g.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n        *   The weight of this tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: **no CO₂ was produced**. This rules out salts containing carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or oxalate (C₂O₄²⁻) ions.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n        *   The weight increase is due to the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Mass of oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O is 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since the gas is molecular oxygen (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and Verify Conservation of Mass:**\n    The total mass of the starting salts (7.20 g) must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   The most common gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that would be produced from heating salts is nitrogen gas (N₂), with M ≈ 14.01 × 2 = 28.02 g/mol. This is also consistent with the fact that no carbon was detected (no CO₂). So, **Gas C is N₂**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture:**\n    The atoms in the product gases (H₂O, O₂, N₂) must have come from the original salts A and B. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles(H) = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles(N) = 2 × Moles(N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** O is in H₂O and O₂. Moles(O) = Moles(O in H₂O) + Moles(O in O₂) = 0.20 mol + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n    So, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. The mole ratio is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives N₈H₄O₅, which is wrong. N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25 -> 20:40:25 -> simplified by 5 gives **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n4.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    We have an equimolar mixture of A and B. Let's say there are `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n    *   The total chemical formula of the `n`(A+B) mixture that was heated is N₀.₂₀H₀.₄₀O₀.₂₅.\n    *   This means the formula of one \"unit\" of (A+B) is proportional to N₄H₈O₅.\n    *   The molar mass of a N₄H₈O₅ unit is 4(14.01) + 8(1.008) + 5(16.00) ≈ 56 + 8 + 80 = 144 g/mol.\n    *   The total mass of the mixture is `n` × (Molar Mass of A + Molar Mass of B).\n    *   If the formula of (A+B) is N₄H₈O₅, then M(A)+M(B) = 144 g/mol.\n    *   The amount of this combined unit is `n` = Total Mass / Combined Molar Mass = 7.20 g / 144 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the mixture consists of **0.05 mol of salt A** and **0.05 mol of salt B**.\n\n    Now we need to find two salts, A and B, whose formulas add up to N₄H₈O₅ and are consistent with the problem's conditions (decomposing to gas, no C, etc.).\n    *   The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen suggests ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts. The H₈ in the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ suggests two NH₄⁺ ions (2 × 4 = 8 H).\n    *   Let's try splitting N₄H₈O₅ into two common ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Candidate salts: Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Let's check their formulas:\n        *   NH₄NO₃ -> **N₂H₄O₃**\n        *   NH₄NO₂ -> **N₂H₄O₂**\n    *   Sum of formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Let's check their molar masses:\n        *   M(NH₄NO₃) = 80.0 g/mol\n        *   M(NH₄NO₂) = 64.0 g/mol\n    *   Sum of molar masses: 80.0 + 64.0 = **144.0 g/mol**. This also matches perfectly.\n\n    Thus, the salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their individual chemical formulas.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
