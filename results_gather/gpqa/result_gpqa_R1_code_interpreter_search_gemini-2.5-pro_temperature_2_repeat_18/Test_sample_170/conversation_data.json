    "This question requires us to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination. The outcome of electrophilic aromatic substitution is governed by the substituent already present on the benzene ring. We need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Classify the Substituents:**\n    We first classify the substituents on the benzene ring (`C6H5-`) as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n    *   **Ortho,para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, `Br+`) to the ortho and para positions. They are typically electron-donating groups (activating groups), with the exception of halogens, which are deactivating but still ortho,para-directing.\n        *   1) `-CH3` (methyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n        *   5) `-C2H5` (ethyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n        *   3) `-Cl` (chloro): Deactivating, o,p-director.\n    *   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are electron-withdrawing groups (deactivating groups).\n        *   4) `-NO2` (nitro): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n        *   6) `-COOH` (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n        *   2) `-COOC2H5` (ethyl ester): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directors:**\n    For meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is very low. The amount of para product formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para (and ortho) isomers.\n    The order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n    `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`\n    Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the lowest for `-NO2`, followed by `-COOH`, and then `-COOC2H5`.\n    The order of *increasing* para-isomer yield is:\n    `C6H5-NO2` (4) < `C6H5-COOH` (6) < `C6H5-COOC2H5` (2).\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho,Para-Directors:**\n    For ortho,para-directors, the main products are the ortho and para isomers. The ratio between them (and thus the percentage yield of the para-isomer) depends on steric and electronic factors.\n    *   **Comparing `-CH3` (1) and `-C2H5` (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes substitution at the para position more favorable for ethylbenzene than for toluene. Thus, the percentage yield of the para-isomer is higher for ethylbenzene.\n        Order: `C6H5-CH3` (1) < `C6H5-C2H5` (5). (Typical para yields are ~62% for toluene and ~66% for ethylbenzene).\n    *   **Comparing with `-Cl` (3):** The chlorine atom is a halogen. Although it directs ortho,para via its lone-pair resonance (+R effect), it is deactivating overall due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect). This inductive effect strongly destabilizes the adjacent positive charge in the arenium ion intermediate formed during ortho-attack. As a result, ortho substitution is significantly disfavored, leading to a very high proportion of the para-isomer. The para yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is typically very high, around 89%.\n    *   This yield (89%) is higher than the para yields for both toluene (~62%) and ethylbenzene (~66%).\n    Therefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield among the ortho,para-directors is:\n    `C6H5-CH3` (1) < `C6H5-C2H5` (5) < `C6H5-Cl` (3).\n\n4.  **Combine the Groups:**\n    The yield of the para-isomer for any ortho,para-director is significantly greater than the trace amounts produced from meta-directing substrates. So, the final combined order is obtained by placing the ordered list of meta-directors before the ordered list of ortho,para-directors.\n\n    *   Meta-directors order: 4 < 6 < 2\n    *   Ortho,para-directors order: 1 < 5 < 3\n\n    Combining them gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n    4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
