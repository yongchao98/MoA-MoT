    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2 as:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_4))^(1/2) * (1 - A_4)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   Since both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and will cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so `A_4 = A_2`. The term `(1 - A)^(1/4)` will also cancel out.\n    *   The constant `2` in the denominator also cancels.\n    This simplification leaves us with:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1 / a_4)^(1/2) / (1 / a_2)^(1/2)`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)`\n\n5.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`):\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n    This can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n    `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be written as a ratio of their orbital periods:\n    `a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve for the Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [(P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)]^(1/2)`\n    Multiplying the exponents (`2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3`), we get:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem gives the orbital period ratios as `1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`.\n    *   For Planet_2, the ratio value for the period `P_2` is 2.\n    *   For Planet_4, the ratio value for the period `P_4` is 3.5.\n    The ratio `P_2 / P_4` is therefore `2 / 3.5`.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Plug the period ratio into our final equation:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n    To find the numerical value, we can use a small python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet_2 to Planet_4\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the period ratio.\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n\nThe output of the code is approximately `0.82998`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.83\nB) ~0.75\nC) ~0.57\nD) ~0.69\n\nThe calculated value `~0.83` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
