    "**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DBE Calculation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2), where C is carbon, H is hydrogen, N is nitrogen, and X is a halogen.\n*   **DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 10/2 = 5.**\n*   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH2 group)**. One band corresponds to the symmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the asymmetric stretch.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is characteristic of an **ester C=O group**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It's too high for a typical amide (~1680 cm-1) and too low for a non-conjugated saturated ester (~1740 cm-1).\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is a definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. This confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl (-COOCH2CH3)**, which is an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those in an alcohol (-OH) or an amine (-NH2). Since the IR spectrum already identified a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **-NH2 group**. Its broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This symmetrical pattern is indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two aromatic protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to each other but are different from the two protons on the other side.\n    *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group.\n    *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester (-COOEt) group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\n*   We have a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   Assembling these fragments gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verify the Proposed Structure and Evaluate Options:**\n\n*   **Structure:** Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (also known as benzocaine).\n    \n    NH2 - (benzene ring) - COOCH2CH3\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:** C9H11NO2. Matches.\n*   **Spectral Data Check:**\n    *   IR: Has -NH2 and ester C=O. Matches.\n    *   NMR: Has an ethyl ester, a para-substituted ring, and an -NH2 group. Matches all signals.\n\n*   **Evaluating other options:**\n    *   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group protons (-CH2CO) would give a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** The IR for an amide C=O is lower (~1680 cm-1). A 1,3-substituted ring would give a more complex aromatic pattern, not two doublets.\n    *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), so it would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. It would also have a very downfield formyl proton (H-C=O) signal in the NMR, which is absent.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all provided data, the compound is unequivocally identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
