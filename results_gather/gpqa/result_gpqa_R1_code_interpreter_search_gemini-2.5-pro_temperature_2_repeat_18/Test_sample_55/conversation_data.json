    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\nThe question asks for the specific pathway and the corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom to decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state) through a sequence of two electric dipole transitions.\n\n### 2. Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay (emission), energy must be released, so $n$ must decrease ($n_f < n_i$).\n\n### 3. Analyzing the First Transition\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n*   **Applying the selection rules:**\n    *   Since $l_i=0$, the change in angular momentum quantum number $\\Delta l$ must be $+1$. The $\\Delta l = -1$ case is impossible as $l$ cannot be negative. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $l_{int} = l_i + 1 = 1$.\n    *   Since the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease, the intermediate state must have $n_{int} < 3$. The most likely transitions are those to the next lowest energy level, so $n_{int}=2$ is a very probable intermediate state, as suggested by all the options.\n    *   For the magnetic quantum number $m$, we have $\\Delta m = m_{int} - m_i = m_{int} - 0 = m_{int}$. The selection rule is $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, which means $m_{int}$ can be $0, -1,$ or $1$.\n*   **Conclusion for the first step:** The atom must transition from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to one of the $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ states, where $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. These are the $2p$ orbitals. So, the first step is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$.\n\n### 4. Analyzing the Second Transition\n*   **Initial state (intermediate state of the cascade):** $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying the selection rules:**\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int}$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. Since $m_{int}$ can be $0, \\pm 1$, this condition is always satisfied for any of the possible intermediate states.\n*   **Conclusion for the second step:** A transition from any of the $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ states to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state is allowed by the dipole selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route, for example, the one given in option C: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nThe total probability of this cascade occurring is the probability of the first step happening, multiplied by the probability of the second step happening given the first has occurred.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** We need to find the probability that the atom, starting in $|3,0,0\\rangle$, decays specifically into $|2,1,0\\rangle$ rather than into $|2,1,1\\rangle$ or $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. This is given by the branching ratio. The transition rate $A_{i \\to f}$ is proportional to $|\\langle f|\\mathbf{d}|i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\mathbf{d}=e\\mathbf{r}$ is the dipole operator.\n    $A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle) \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m_{int} | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an $s$-orbital). In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the degenerate $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ states must be the same, regardless of the value of $m_{int}$.\n    Let the rate for one such transition be $A_0$. The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $2p$ level is the sum of the rates to all possible final states:\n    $A_{total} = A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) + A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) + A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = A_0 + A_0 + A_0 = 3A_0$.\n    The branching ratio for the transition to the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is:\n    $B = \\frac{A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle)}{A_{total}} = \\frac{A_0}{3A_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    (Note: The only allowed electric dipole decay for the $3s$ state is to a $np$ state. The decay to $2p$ is by far the most dominant, so we can assume other channels are negligible.)\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in the intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it needs to decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ (a $2p$ state) can only decay to the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$) via an electric dipole transition. All other transitions to lower energy states are forbidden. Thus, the probability of this second step, given the atom is in the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state, is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of the entire cascade sequence $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 6. Evaluating the Options\nLet's check the given options:\nA) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\nB) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. This route is also valid, but its probability is $1/3$, not $1/4$.\nC) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation for both the route and its probability.\nD) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. This route is valid, but its probability is $1/3$, not $1/4$.\n\nTherefore, option C provides a valid decay route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<C>>>"
