    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure. It's a hexane chain with a ketone at carbon 3 and a methoxy group (-OCH3) at carbon 5.\n    *   The structure is: CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   There is a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone functional group (C=O) to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The reduction of the ketone at C3 will create a new chiral center. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral because the two groups attached to it (ethyl and 2-methoxypropyl) are different.\n    *   The attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can occur from either the front face or the back face of the planar carbonyl group. This will lead to the formation of two possible configurations (R and S) at the newly formed stereocenter (C3).\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction conditions.\n    *   Therefore, starting with a single enantiomer ((S) at C5), the reaction will produce two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have one stereocenter in common (C5 is S in both) and one that is different (C3 is R in one and S in the other). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not mirror images are called **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This is an achiral molecule (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The product of the reaction is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   For a molecule with two chiral centers, there can be a maximum of 2² = 4 stereoisomers. Let's analyze the possibilities for pentane-2,4-diol:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the molecule (the groups at both ends are identical, CH₃-CH(OH)-), we need to check for a meso compound. A meso compound is an achiral compound that has chiral centers. It typically possesses an internal plane of symmetry. The (2R, 4S) configuration is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R), and has an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol is a single **meso compound**.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   Since the starting material (pentane-2,4-dione) is achiral and the reagent (NaBH₄) is also achiral, the chiral products must be formed in a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers. This is called a **racemic mixture**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one meso compound and a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions. Let's list all the distinct compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\nSo, there are a total of **five** different stereoisomers in the mixture.\n\n**A) Normal-phase HPLC (achiral column):**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II are the meso compound and the enantiomeric pair. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers. Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute. This gives **1 peak** for the pair.\n    *   The meso compound (meso-pentane-2,4-diol) will give its own peak, separate from the enantiomeric pair. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different molecules (different formula, molecular weight, and functional groups - ether vs. second alcohol). They will have very different polarities and will not co-elute.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks on a normal-phase column will be the sum of peaks from separable groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (meso from Rxn II) + 1 (enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC (chiral stationary phase):**\n*   This technique uses a chiral environment to separate stereoisomers. It can separate not only diastereomers but also enantiomers.\n*   A chiral column interacts differently with each of the stereoisomers in the mixture, assuming the column has sufficient resolving power.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture again, which contains five distinct compounds:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2 (Diastereomer of 1, separable)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3 (Diastereomer of 4/5, separable)\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5 (Enantiomer of 4, separable on a chiral column)\n*   Each of these five compounds will have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and thus a different retention time.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be **5 peaks**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
