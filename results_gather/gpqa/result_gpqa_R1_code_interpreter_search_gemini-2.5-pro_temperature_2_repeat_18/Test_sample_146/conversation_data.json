    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Physical Process**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). In this process, their mass is converted into other particles with kinetic energy. The reaction is:\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\n### **2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use two fundamental principles of physics:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the annihilation must be equal to the total energy after.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the annihilation must be equal to the total momentum after.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation)**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have one proton ($p$) and one antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   **Energy ($E_i$):**\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In particle physics, this typically means its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can approximate its velocity as zero.\n    *   The proton is assumed to be the stationary target, so its velocity is also zero.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   $E_i = E_{p} + E_{\\bar{p}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n    *   Protons and antiprotons have the same mass ($m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_i = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Momentum ($P_i$):** Since both particles are considered to be at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n    *   $P_i = 0$.\n\n### **4. Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. They are antiparticles of each other and have the same mass, $m_A$.\n*   **Energy ($E_f$):**\n    *   The four resulting particles will be moving at high speeds. Their total energy is the sum of their individual relativistic energies.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a single particle is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $v$ is its velocity.\n    *   Due to the conservation of momentum (the initial momentum was zero), the final products must move in such a way that their total vector momentum is also zero. For the energy to be distributed, it's reasonable to assume that all four particles emerge with the same speed, $v$, and thus the same Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles: $E_f = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$.\n    *   We are given that $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   So, $E_f = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Momentum ($P_f$):** By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must be zero.\n    *   $P_f = 0$. This condition is satisfied if the particles fly off symmetrically (for example, one pair back-to-back and the other pair also back-to-back in a different direction).\n\n### **5. Equate Initial and Final Energy**\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, $E_i = E_f$:\n$1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### **6. Solve for the Velocity**\n\nFirst, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\nNow, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7687$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\nFor a more precise calculation, we can use a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Use the standard value for proton rest mass energy in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.272\n# Given rest mass energy for particle A\nm_A_c2 = 300\n\n# Total initial energy from the rest mass of the proton and antiproton\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# The total final energy is the relativistic energy of the four A particles.\n# E_final = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# By conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final\n# So, 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n\n# Solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Now, solve for beta (v/c) using the formula for gamma:\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)  =>  beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is approximately {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77c\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principles:** The problem describes a particle-antiparticle annihilation. The fundamental principles governing this interaction are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   The system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics, this means its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can approximate its velocity as zero. The proton is assumed to be the stationary target, so its velocity is also considered zero.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n    *   The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical. The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   So, $E_i = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   Let the mass of each particle A be $m_A$.

The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of their relativistic energies.\n    *   The energy of a single A particle moving at speed $v$ is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total final energy is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n    *   Substituting the given value, $E_f = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   We equate the initial and final energies: $E_i = E_f$.\n    *   $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Velocity ($v$):**\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity.

    "This problem can be solved by applying the principle of **conservation of energy**.\n\n### **1. Initial State Energy ($E_i$)**\n\nThe system initially consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\", which means we can neglect its kinetic energy. The proton is the stationary target. Therefore, the total initial energy of the system is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n\n*   The rest mass of a proton is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   The total initial energy is:\n    $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_i = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nAlso, since both particles are effectively at rest, the initial momentum of the system is zero.\n\n### **2. Final State Energy ($E_f$)**\n\nThe system in the final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n\n*   All four particles have the same mass, $m_A$, with a rest mass energy given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum was zero), the final particles must move in such a way that their total vector momentum is also zero. For the energy to be distributed equally among them, we assume they all move with the same speed, $v$.\n*   The total energy of each particle A is given by the relativistic energy equation:\n    $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n    $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    $E_f = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### **3. Conservation of Energy**\n\nBy equating the initial and final energies ($E_i = E_f$):\n$1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNow, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Velocity**\n\nWe can find the velocity, $v$, from the Lorentz factor. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n\nThe relationship is: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearranging to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$\\beta \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.769c$.\n\nThis value, when rounded to two decimal places, is $0.77c$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
