    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the reaction type.**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given: ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its dehydration yields maleic anhydride.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃). Due to the molecule's symmetry (a C₂v point group), the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent, as are the two carbonyl carbons.\n    *   ¹H NMR: The two equivalent vinyl protons would give a single peak. Being on a double bond conjugated to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, their chemical shift would be significantly downfield, around 7 ppm. This matches the data.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: We expect two signals. One for the two equivalent vinyl carbons (C=C) and one for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). Alkene carbons are typically 100-150 ppm (137 ppm fits well), and carbonyl carbons are 160-200 ppm (165 ppm fits well).\n    *   Conclusion: The dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene (C₉H₁₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and stereochemistry of the products.**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and the substituted cyclopentadiene will form a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system with an anhydride ring fused to it.\n*   The molecular formula of the product would be C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) + C₉H₁₄ (diene) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem, confirming our structural assignment.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two main stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** states that for kinetically controlled reactions (which are typical for Diels-Alder), the *endo* product is favored. In the *endo* product, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system, which is the C=C double bond in this case. In simpler terms, the anhydride is tucked \"underneath\" the new double bond.\n    *   The *exo* product is typically the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored product.\n    *   Therefore, it is standard to assume: **Major Product = Endo isomer** and **Minor Product = Exo isomer**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the expected NOESY correlations for the Endo and Exo isomers.**\n*   The Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is a through-space interaction observed between protons that are physically close to each other (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak in a 2D NOESY spectrum indicates such proximity.\n*   The question describes a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. We must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   Let's identify the key proton groups in the product and estimate their chemical shifts:\n    *   **Ha:** The two protons on the anhydride part of the structure. They are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry in the product. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and part of a strained ring, so they will be deshielded. A reasonable estimate is ~3-4 ppm. The `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` is a perfect match for these protons.\n    *   **Mv (Vinyl methyls):** The two methyl groups on the C=C double bond (from C2 and C3 of the diene). They are equivalent by symmetry. Their protons (6H total) will appear as a singlet. Vinylic methyls typically resonate around 1.5-2.0 ppm. The `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm` is a good assignment.\n    *   **Mb (Bridgehead methyls):** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (from C1 and C4 of the diene). They are also equivalent by symmetry. As methyls on saturated carbons, they will be the most shielded. The `6H singlet at ~1 ppm` fits well.\n    *   **H-bridge:** The two protons on the C7 methylene bridge (from C5 of the diene). These two protons (`syn` and `anti` to the double bond) are diastereotopic and should have different chemical shifts and couple to each other. The `1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm` corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n\n*   **Spatial relationships:**\n    *   **In the Endo (major) product:** The anhydride ring (with Ha protons) is tucked underneath the C2=C3 double bond. This brings the **Ha** protons close to the **Mv** (vinyl methyl) groups. The Ha protons are also close to the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge.\n    *   **In the Exo (minor) product:** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond. The **Ha** protons are now far from the **Mv** groups and the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge. Instead, they are closer to the bridgehead methyl groups (Mb).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** A NOESY cross-peak between **Ha** and **Mv** is expected to be **strong in the endo isomer** and **absent in the exo isomer**. This exactly matches the description in the problem.\n\n**Step 4: Match the conclusion with the given options.**\n*   We need the cross-peak connecting the resonances for **Ha** and **Mv**.\n*   Based on our assignments:\n    *   Resonance for **Ha** is the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`.\n    *   Resonance for **Mv** is the `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`.\n*   This corresponds to the pair described in option C.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   A) `Mb (~1 ppm)` and `Mv (~1.7 ppm)`: These groups are not particularly close in either isomer.\n*   B) `H-bridge (~1.5 ppm)` and `Ha (~3.5 ppm)`: This interaction (specifically with the *syn*-bridge proton) is also expected in the endo isomer but not the exo. However, the interaction between Ha and Mv (Option C) is the most direct consequence of the secondary orbital interactions that define the endo selectivity of the Diels-Alder reaction, making it the most characteristic cross-peak.\n*   D) `Mb (~1 ppm)` and `H-bridge (~1.5 ppm)`: An NOE between a bridgehead methyl and a C7 proton might exist, but it would not be the key differentiating peak between the endo and exo isomers in the same way as those involving the mobile anhydride ring protons.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and chemically significant cross-peak that distinguishes the major (endo) from the minor (exo) product is the one between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl groups.\n\n<<<C>>>"
