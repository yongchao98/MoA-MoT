    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which makes it a good Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction between a ketone enolate and an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound in the presence of a base is a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) removes an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's examine the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one (the carbons adjacent to the C=O group):\n        *   **C-2:** This carbon is quaternary, bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C-1), and C-3. It has **no** α-protons.\n        *   **C-6:** This carbon is tertiary, bonded to a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C-1), C-5, and one hydrogen. It has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Since only the C-6 position has an α-proton, deprotonation must occur there. t-BuOK removes the proton from C-6 to form the corresponding enolate. This is the only possible enolate, so it is both the kinetic and thermodynamic product.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed is the nucleophile. The C-6 carbon of the enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n        *   Nucleophile: Cyclohexanone enolate (nucleophilic at C-6).\n        *   Electrophile (Michael Acceptor): `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt`. The attack occurs at the β-carbon.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   After the attack and subsequent protonation (usually during workup), the final product is formed.\n    *   The initial cyclohexanone ring structure remains, but now C-6 has two substituents: the original methyl group and a new `-(CH₂)₂-COOEt` group (an ethyl propanoate chain).\n    *   The full structure is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Now, we must match this structure to the names provided in the options. The options name the compound as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. Let's try naming our product that way.\n        *   Parent chain: ethyl propanoate.\n        *   Substituent at C-3: a complex cyclohexyl group.\n    *   To name the substituent, we number the cyclohexane ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C-6).\n        *   **C-1** (attachment point): Has a methyl group. -> `1-methyl`.\n        *   **C-2** (adjacent to C-1): Is the carbonyl carbon. -> `2-oxo`.\n        *   **C-3** (adjacent to C-2): Has an ethyl group and a methyl group. -> `3-ethyl-3-methyl`.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`. The \"1,3-dimethyl\" part accounts for the methyl groups at positions 1 and 3.\n    *   Therefore, the full name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the structure given for A in options A and C.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is also a **Michael addition**. The nitroalkane is deprotonated to form a carbanion (a nitronate), which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic.\n    *   KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nitronate anion: `CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`. This is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n        *   Nucleophile: `CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`\n        *   Electrophile (Michael Acceptor): `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The attack occurs at the β-carbon.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   After the attack, an intermediate enolate is formed at the α-position to the nitrile, which is then protonated by water (H₂O).\n    *   The resulting molecule's carbon skeleton is:\n        ```\n              NO₂\n              |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH -- CH(CH₃) -- CH₂ -- CN\n        ```\n    *   To name this product, we follow IUPAC rules:\n        *   **Principal Functional Group:** Nitrile (-CN), so the suffix is `-nitrile`. The nitrile carbon is C-1.\n        *   **Longest Carbon Chain:** Find the longest chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n          `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-C(1)N`\n          The chain is 6 carbons long, so the parent alkane is hexane. The parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n        *   **Substituents:** There is a methyl group at C-3 and a nitro group at C-4.\n        *   **Final Name:** Combining these parts gives **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the structure for B given in options A and D.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given choices:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nThe combination of our derived products for A and B matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
