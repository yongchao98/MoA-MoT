    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic compounds. Let's break down the spectral information:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and they are equal in number.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. This tells us there are three distinct types of methyl protons, and their relative abundance is 2:1:1. The fact that they are all singlets means there is no proton-proton coupling between adjacent carbon atoms for any of these alkyl groups (which is expected for methyl groups attached to a benzene ring).\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and symmetry of each option to predict its individual 1H NMR spectrum. All compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** representing 2 hydrogens (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** representing 12 hydrogens (12H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two pairs of equivalent methyl groups: (the inner ones at C2 and C3) and (the outer ones at C1 and C4). This results in **two singlets**, each representing 6 hydrogens (6H). Their integration ratio would be 1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H + 6H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two different singlets**, each representing 1 hydrogen (1H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are, in principle, chemically non-equivalent. However, accidental equivalence is common. The spectrum typically shows **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H + 1H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H + 3H + 3H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. This fits.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons on the ethyl groups will be split by their neighbors. The -CH2- protons will be a **quartet**, and the -CH3 protons will be a **triplet**. The problem states that all alkyl signals are *singlets*, so this compound can be immediately ruled out. This eliminates option A.\n\n### **3. Test the Combinations in a 1:1 Mixture**\n\nNow we test the remaining combinations (options B, C, and D) to see which one matches the observed spectrum of the mixture.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Prehnitene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   **Result:** Two singlets. Since the mixture is 1:1 and both signals correspond to 2H, their integration ratio will be 1:1. **This matches the data.**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet (12H).\n        *   Prehnitene contributes two singlets (6H each).\n        *   **Result:** Three singlets in total. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also matches the data.**\n    *   This combination is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   Durene: one singlet (2H).\n        *   Isodurene: two singlets (1H each).\n        *   **Result:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   Prehnitene: one singlet (2H).\n        *   Isodurene: two singlets (1H each).\n        *   **Result:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed spectrum.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces an NMR spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
