    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have regular hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the active species being the amide ion, :NH2-).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This reaction is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The strong base, :NH2-, removes a proton from a carbon *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such *ortho* positions: C2 (with deuterium, D) and C6 (with hydrogen, H).\n    *   The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Therefore, removing the H from C6 is kinetically favored over removing the D from C2 (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect). However, since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Elimination involving the deuterium at C2**\n        *   The base abstracts the deuterium (as D+) from C2.\n        *   The leaving group, bromide (Br-), is eliminated from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this benzyne intermediate has no deuterium atoms. It is the standard, non-substituted benzyne (1,2-didehydrobenzene).\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Elimination involving the hydrogen at C6**\n        *   The base abstracts the proton (H+) from C6.\n        *   The leaving group, bromide (Br-), is eliminated from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. Importantly, the deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. This is a deuterated benzyne intermediate (3-deuterio-1,2-didehydrobenzene, if we number the triple bond as C1-C2).\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (:NH2-), now attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to give the final aniline product.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C2. The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack C1 or C2.\n        *   Attack at C1 (followed by protonation at C2) gives aniline.\n        *   Attack at C2 (followed by protonation at C1) also gives aniline.\n        *   Since the intermediate is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same single product.\n        *   **Product 1: Aniline**\n\n         \n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (deuterated benzyne):**\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. This intermediate is not symmetrical. The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack C1 or C6, leading to different products.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline** (o-deuterioaniline).\n        *   **Product 2: 2-deuterioaniline**\n\n         \n\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. To name this compound systematically, we renumber the ring starting from the -NH2 group as position 1. In this new numbering, the old C6 is now C1, and the old C2 is now C3. Thus, the product is **3-deuterioaniline** (m-deuterioaniline).\n        *   **Product 3: 3-deuterioaniline**\n\n         \n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    The reaction yields three distinct organic products which are isotopomers (molecules that differ only in their isotopic composition):\n    1.  Aniline (from the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n    2.  2-deuterioaniline (from the deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n    3.  3-deuterioaniline (from the deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
