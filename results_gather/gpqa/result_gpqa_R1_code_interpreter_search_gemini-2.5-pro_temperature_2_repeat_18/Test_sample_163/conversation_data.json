    "The thinking process and calculations are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle**: For an eclipsing, double-lined spectroscopic binary star system, the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2). The formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law.\n    *   M_total = [P * (K1 + K2)³] / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n2.  **Simplify the formula based on given information**: The problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This implies that the orbital inclination angle (i) is approximately 90 degrees. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, so sin³(i) = 1. This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n    *   M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n    The term 1/(2πG) is a constant and will cancel out when we take the ratio of the two masses.\n3.  **Define the variables for each system**:\n    *   **System 1**:\n        *   Period, P1 = 2 years\n        *   Sum of velocity amplitudes, K_total_1 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2**:\n        *   Period, P2 = 1 year\n        *   Sum of velocity amplitudes, K_total_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n4.  **Set up the ratio**: We want to find the ratio of the mass of system 1 (M1) to the mass of system 2 (M2).\n    *   M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K_total_1)³] / [P2 * (K_total_2)³]\n5.  **Substitute the values and calculate**:\n    *   M1 / M2 = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\n    *   M1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n    *   M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n    *   M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    *   M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n    *   M1 / M2 = 0.432\n6.  **Compare the result to the options**:\n    *   A) ~ 0.7\n    *   B) ~ 0.6\n    *   C) ~ 0.4\n    *   D) ~ 1.2\n    The calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nThe Python code executed in the previous turn confirmed this result, yielding `0.43199999999999994`, which is the floating-point representation of `0.432`. There are no errors in the calculation.\n\nThus, system 1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
