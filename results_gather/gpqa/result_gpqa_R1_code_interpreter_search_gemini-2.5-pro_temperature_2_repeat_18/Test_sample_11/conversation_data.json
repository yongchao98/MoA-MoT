    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe decay of a stationary particle into two other particles is governed by two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\nSince the energies involved are comparable to the rest mass energies of the particles, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n### **2. Define the States**\n\n**Initial State (Before Decay):**\n*   The particle is a positive pion ($\\pi^+$).\n*   It is stationary, which means its velocity is 0.\n*   Initial momentum ($\\vec{p}_i$): $p_{\\pi^+} = 0$.\n*   Initial total energy ($E_i$): Since it's at rest, its kinetic energy is 0. The total energy is purely its rest mass energy.\n    $E_i = E_{\\pi^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Final State (After Decay):**\n*   The products are a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$). In this context, neutrinos are treated as massless unless stated otherwise.\n*   Final momentum ($\\vec{p}_f$): $\\vec{p}_f = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n*   Final total energy ($E_f$): $E_f = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   The total energy of the muon is $E_{\\mu^+} = \\text{KE}_{\\mu^+} + m_{\\mu^+}c^2$.\n    *   For the massless neutrino, its rest mass energy is 0, so its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy: $E_{\\nu} = \\text{KE}_{\\nu}$.\n\n### **3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**\n*   $\\vec{p}_i = \\vec{p}_f$\n*   $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n*   This implies $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} = -\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n*   The muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude $p$, so $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$.\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\n*   $E_i = E_f$\n*   $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n### **4. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe relationship between total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest mass ($m$) is: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n\n*   For the muon ($\\mu^+$): $E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 \\implies E_{\\mu^+} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n*   For the massless neutrino ($\\nu$): $E_{\\nu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (0)^2 \\implies E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\nSince $E_{\\nu} = \\text{KE}_{\\nu}$, we have $\\text{KE}_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n### **5. Solve for the Unknown Energies**\n\nSubstitute the energy expressions back into the energy conservation equation:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\nNow, we solve for $pc$ (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy):\n1.  Isolate the square root term: $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n2.  Square both sides: $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n3.  Expand the left side: $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n4.  The $(pc)^2$ terms cancel out: $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n5.  Solve for $pc$: $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2m_{\\pi^+}c^2}$\n\nThis formula gives us the kinetic energy of the neutrino: $\\text{KE}_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon can be found from the total energy release (Q-value):\n*   Total Kinetic Energy = $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = \\text{KE}_{\\mu^+} + \\text{KE}_{\\nu}$\n*   $\\text{KE}_{\\mu^+} = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - m_{\\mu^+}c^2) - \\text{KE}_{\\nu}$\n\n### **6. Calculation**\n\nLet's use Python to compute the values precisely.\n```python\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest energy of Pi+ in MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest energy of mu+ in MeV\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu = p*c)\n# Formula: p*c = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The total energy released as kinetic energy is the Q-value of the reaction\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# The remaining kinetic energy belongs to the muon\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon: {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nKE of muon: 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino: 29.78 MeV\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon ($\\mu^+$) and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino ($\\nu$).\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nOur calculated result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a classic particle physics problem that can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in a relativistic framework.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Process:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A single positive pion ($\\pi^+$) at rest.\n    *   **Final State:** A positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$).\n    *   **Process:** The decay of the pion: $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n        Since the initial pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero ($\\vec{p}_{\\pi^+} = 0$). To conserve momentum, the total momentum of the final particles must also be zero.\n        $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0$\n        This implies that the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude $p$:\n        $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:**\n        The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. Since the energies involved are comparable to the rest mass energies, we must use the relativistic energy formula.\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n\n        *   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The pion is at rest, so its kinetic energy is zero. Its total energy is its rest mass energy ($m c^2$).\n            $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n        *   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total energy of the final state is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n            $E_{final} = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n        So, the energy conservation equation is:\n        $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n3.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The relationship between a particle's total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest mass ($m$) is given by:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$\n\n    *   **For the muon ($\\mu^+$):**\n        $E_{\\mu^+} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n        Its kinetic energy is $\\text{KE}_{\\mu^+} = E_{\\mu^+} - m_{\\mu^+}c^2$.\n\n    *   **For the neutrino ($\\nu$):**\n        Neutrinos have a very small mass and are treated as massless in this context ($m_{\\nu} = 0$).\n        $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (0)^2} = pc$\n        Since its rest mass is zero, the neutrino's total energy is equal to its kinetic energy: $\\text{KE}_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Energies:**\n    Substitute the expressions for $E_{\\mu^+}$ and $E_{\\nu}$ back into the energy conservation equation:\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n    We can now solve for the term $pc$, which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino ($\\text{KE}_{\\nu}$).\n    1.  Rearrange the equation: $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n    2.  Square both sides: $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n    3.  Expand the left side: $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n    4.  The $(pc)^2$ terms cancel out. Rearrange to solve for $pc$:\n        $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi^+}c^2}$\n\n    Now, we can find the kinetic energy of the muon ($\\text{KE}_{\\mu^+}$). The total energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest mass energy and the final rest mass energies.\n    $\\text{KE}_{total} = \\text{KE}_{\\mu^+} + \\text{KE}_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - m_{\\mu^+}c^2$\n    Therefore, $\\text{KE}_{\\mu^+} = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - m_{\\mu^+}c^2) - \\text{KE}_{\\nu}$\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    To perform the calculation efficiently and accurately, we use the provided data in a Python script.\n\n    **Given Values:**\n    *   $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n    *   $m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n\n```python\n# Rest energy of Pi(+) in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\n# Rest energy of mu(+) in MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu), which is equal to p*c.\n# Formula from derivation: KE_nu = ((m_pi_c2)^2 - (m_mu_c2)^2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The total kinetic energy released is the Q-value of the reaction.\n# Q = initial rest energy - final rest energy\ntotal_ke = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is the total KE minus the neutrino's KE.\nke_mu = total_ke - ke_nu\n\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the product particles are:\")\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nThe kinetic energy of the product particles are:\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n</execute_code>\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation shows that the kinetic energy of the muon ($\\mu^+$) is **4.12 MeV** and the kinetic energy of the neutrino ($\\nu$) is **29.78 MeV**, which can be rounded to **29.8 MeV**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>",
