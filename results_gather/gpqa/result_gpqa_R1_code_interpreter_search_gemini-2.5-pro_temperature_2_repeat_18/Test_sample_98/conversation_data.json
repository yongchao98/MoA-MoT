    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the region of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong, sharp peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the class of compound but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in interpreting the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four given structures (they are all saturated carboxylic acids).\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates that a proton (or a set of equivalent protons) is being split by three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   A group with **one** proton (n=1), leading to a **d**oublet (n+1=2).\n    *   A group with **two** protons (n=2), leading to a **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n    *   A group with **three** protons (n=3), leading to a **q**uartet (n+1=4).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates another proton (or set of protons) is being split by three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   A group with **one** proton (n=1), leading to a **d**oublet (n+1=2).\n    *   A group with **two** protons (n=2), leading to a **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n    *   Another, non-equivalent group with **two** protons (n=2), leading to another **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n\n### **3. Structural Analysis of the Options**\n\nLet's deduce the structure for each option and predict the splitting patterns for the protons on the main chain, as these are the most likely candidates for such complex splitting. We will assume the formulas are written sequentially along the main carbon backbone and use IUPAC naming to clarify the structures. The COOH group is C1.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Coupled to H-2 (1H, gives a doublet), CH₂ of the ethyl group at C-3 (2H, gives a triplet), and CH₂(4) (2H, gives a triplet). The resulting pattern is **dtt**.\n    *   We need to find a `dtq`. Let's look at other protons. The CH₂ protons at C-4 are diastereotopic and would likely give `ddq` signals. Protons within the ethyl groups would also show complex patterns, but a `dtq` is not apparent. So, this molecule has a `dtt` but is missing the `dtq`.\n\n*   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** This proton is coupled to H-4 (1H, gives a **d**oublet), the CH₂ protons at C-2 (2H, gives a **t**riplet), and the CH₂ protons of the ethyl group at C-3 (2H, gives a **t**riplet). The predicted splitting pattern is **dtt**.\n    *   **H-4:** This proton is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives a **d**oublet), the CH₂ protons of the ethyl group at C-4 (2H, gives a **t**riplet), and the CH₃ protons at C-5 (3H, gives a **q**uartet). The predicted splitting pattern is **dtq**.\n    *   This structure gives rise to both a `dtt` (from H-3) and a `dtq` (from H-4). This is a perfect match for the data.\n\n*   **C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH → 4,5-dimethylhexanoic acid**\n    `(CH₃)₂CH(5)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-4:** Coupled to H-5 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ protons at C-3 (2H, gives a triplet), and the methyl protons on C-4 (3H, gives a quartet). The pattern is **dtq**.\n    *   **H-5:** Coupled to H-4 (1H, gives a doublet) and the six protons of the two methyl groups (6H, gives a septet). The pattern is a doublet of septets.\n    *   This molecule has a `dtq` but is missing the `dtt`.\n\n*   **D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(2)(Me)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Coupled to H-2 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ protons at C-4 (2H, gives a triplet), and the methyl protons on C-3 (3H, gives a quartet). The pattern is **dtq**.\n    *   The molecule has a `dtq` but lacks a proton that would give a `dtt` pattern.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically analyzing the expected ¹H NMR splitting patterns for each of the four possible structures, only compound B provides signals that match the experimental data of having both a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`).\n\n<<<B>>>"
