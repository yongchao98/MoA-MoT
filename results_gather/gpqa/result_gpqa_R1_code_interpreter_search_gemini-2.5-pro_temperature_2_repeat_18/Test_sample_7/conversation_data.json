As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Single Mutant Phenotypes**\n\nFirst, let's understand the role of each gene by looking at the effect of its individual knockout. The baseline is the wild-type (WT) with 100% resistance.\n\n*   **g1 (G1 knockout):** Resistance drops to 75%. This means G1 contributes to the plant's resistance, but its loss is not catastrophic. It accounts for about 25% of the total resistance effect.\n*   **g2 (G2 knockout):** Resistance drops to 0%. This is the most severe phenotype. It indicates that gene G2 is absolutely essential for any resistance to the pathogen. The entire resistance pathway seems to depend on a functional G2 gene.\n*   **g3 (G3 knockout):** Resistance drops to 50%. This indicates that G3 plays a more significant role in resistance than G1, accounting for about 50% of the total effect.\n\n**Intermediate Conclusion:** G2 is a critical gene in the pathway. Given the prompt states that one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others, G2 is the strongest candidate for this role because its absence completely shuts down the resistance response.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Double Mutant Phenotypes (Gene Interactions)**\n\nDouble mutants are used to study genetic interactions like epistasis. Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another. If the phenotype of a double mutant (`ab`) is the same as one of the single mutants (`a`), then gene `A` is said to be epistatic to gene `B`. This usually implies that `A` acts downstream of `B` in the same pathway or is a master regulator.\n\n*   **g1g2 (G1 and G2 knockout):** Resistance is 0%. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. The effect of the `g1` mutation is completely masked by the `g2` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n\n*   **g2g3 (G2 and G3 knockout):** Resistance is 0%. This is also the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. The effect of the `g3` mutation is masked by the `g2` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\n*   **g1g3 (G1 and G3 knockout):** Resistance is 10%. This phenotype is novel; it is not the same as the `g1` mutant (75%) or the `g3` mutant (50%).\n    *   This is not a classic case of epistasis between G1 and G3.\n    *   Let's consider an additive effect. The loss from g1 is 25% (100-75) and the loss from g3 is 50% (100-50). If the effects were additive, we might expect a total loss of 75%, leading to 25% resistance.\n    *   However, the observed resistance is only 10%, meaning a loss of 90%. This effect is much greater than the sum of the individual effects (90% loss > 25% loss + 50% loss). This phenomenon is called **synergistic interaction**.\n    *   Synergistic interaction often implies that the two genes (G1 and G3) have **redundant functions**. They likely act in parallel pathways or have overlapping roles. When one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate. When both are knocked out, the function is almost completely lost, leading to a much more severe phenotype than expected.\n\n### **3. Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can draw three main conclusions:\n1.  **G2 is an essential gene, epistatic to G1 and G3.** This makes it the most likely candidate for the master **transcription factor** that activates the entire resistance pathway.\n2.  **G1 and G3 have a synergistic interaction.** This indicates they have **redundant functions** in conferring resistance.\n3.  There is **no classical epistasis** between G1 and G3, as the double mutant has a unique, more severe phenotype.\n\nNow let's check the given options against our conclusions:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.** This aligns with our finding that G2 is an essential, epistatic gene.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: **Correct.** This is the best explanation for the synergistic effect seen in the `g1g3` mutant.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **Incorrect.** The phenotype of `g1g3` (10%) is not the same as `g1` (75%).\n\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: **Incorrect.** G2 is the much stronger candidate.\n    *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: **Cannot be determined.** Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measures one trait (resistance).\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: **Correct.**\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.**\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: **Cannot be determined.**\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.**\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: **Cannot be determined** from this data, although it's a possible mechanism.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: **Incorrect.** The phenotype of `g1g3` (10%) is not the same as `g3` (50%).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOption A contains two key, correct conclusions derived directly from the experimental data: that G2 is the likely transcription factor and that G1 and G3 exhibit redundancy. Although its third statement about G1 being epistatic to G3 is technically incorrect based on a classical definition, option A is overwhelmingly the best description of the genetic interactions among the choices provided. The other options contain more significant errors (e.g., misidentifying the transcription factor) or make claims that cannot be supported by the data (pleiotropy). Therefore, Option A is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
