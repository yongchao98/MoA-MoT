    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on experimental observations. Let's break down the key elements of the experiment:\n\n1.  **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins. This is the molecule that will trigger the immune response.\n2.  **Route of Administration:** Oral gavage. This mimics a natural infection of the gut.\n3.  **Location of Response:** Peyer's patches. These are secondary lymphoid organs located in the small intestine, crucial for initiating immune responses to gut pathogens.\n4.  **Cellular Response:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. This indicates that immune cells (likely lymphocytes) have recognized the antigen and are undergoing clonal expansion.\n5.  **Genetic Observation:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" shows \"high variability.\" The variable heavy chain gene is a part of the B cell receptor (and the antibody it will eventually secrete) that directly binds to the antigen.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options in the context of this evidence:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system. It involves a cascade of plasma proteins that can mark pathogens for destruction or form a membrane attack complex. It does not involve gene rearrangement or mutation in lymphocytes. Therefore, it cannot explain the variability in the heavy chain gene.\n\n*   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process occurs in activated B cells, typically within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene (e.g., from producing IgM to IgA or IgG), which alters the antibody's effector function. It does *not* affect the *variable* region, which determines antigen-binding specificity. The question specifically mentions variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a key process that occurs in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs. SHM intentionally introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes. This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. Those B cells whose receptors bind more strongly to the antigen are then selected to survive and proliferate (a process called affinity maturation). The \"proliferating cell population\" with \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" found in a \"Peyer's patch\" after antigen challenge is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation.\n\n*   **D) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in developing B cells in the bone marrow (*primary* lymphoid organ) *before* they ever encounter an antigen. While it creates variability, it is not a process that happens in proliferating mature B cells within a *secondary* lymphoid organ in response to an antigen. The experiment describes an ongoing response to an antigen, not the initial generation of the B cell repertoire.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells from a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure is a direct result of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
