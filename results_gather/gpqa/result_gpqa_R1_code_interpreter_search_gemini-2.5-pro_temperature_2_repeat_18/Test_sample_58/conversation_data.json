    "This problem requires us to determine the final pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The correct approach is to calculate the moles of all acidic and basic species, let them neutralize each other, and then determine the nature of the final solution to calculate the pH.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = **0.05 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ (from HCl, a strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely (HCl → H+ + Cl-).\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = **0.08 mol H+**\n\n*   **Moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2, a strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely, yielding two moles of OH- for every mole of Ba(OH)2 (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-).\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 * 0.09 mol = **0.18 mol OH-**\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H+) will react with the strong base (OH-).\n*   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n*   Initial moles H+ = 0.08 mol\n*   Initial moles OH- = 0.18 mol\n*   The H+ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = **0.10 mol OH-**\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n*   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n*   Initial moles OH- (from previous step) = 0.10 mol\n*   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant in this step. It will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- consumed = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of OH- remaining in excess = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol OH-**\n\n**3. Calculate the pH of the final solution:**\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH-). The pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of this excess OH-.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
