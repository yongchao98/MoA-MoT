    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze and identify substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let's use the approximate atomic masses: Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction of hydrogen is: `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H)) = 0.1428`.\n    *   Substituting the values: `m / (12n + m) ≈ 0.1428`.\n    *   The value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7. So, let's assume the mass fraction is exactly 1/7.\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    *   `7m = 12n + m`\n    *   `6m = 12n`\n    *   `m = 2n`.\n    *   So, the molecular formula of Z is `CnH2n`.\n    *   We are told Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one* substance, Z. This means all compounds in X and Y have the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   We are also told that Z is a constituent of mixture Y, which is formed by a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation of an unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon (which must be in X) typically yields an aromatic compound and a saturated cycloalkane. This strongly suggests that the carbon skeleton is a 6-membered ring.\n    *   Therefore, the saturated cycloalkane Z is cyclohexane (`C6H12`), and the corresponding aromatic compound would be benzene (`C6H6`).\n    *   Let's verify our assumptions: Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). It is widely used as a solvent. The mass percentage of hydrogen in C6H12 is `(12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. This confirms our identification.\n\n2.  **Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which is true for saturated and aromatic compounds.\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is one of the components.\n    *   Y is formed by the disproportionation of X. As reasoned above, this reaction would produce cyclohexane and benzene.\n    *   So, the other component of Y must be benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under these conditions.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane and benzene) would yield only cyclohexane, as stated in the problem (`C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12`).\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Identify the components of mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   They undergo disproportionation upon heating with platinum to form an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). The reaction is: `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   From the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on both sides must be equal. If A is C6Hx and B is C6Hy, then the total number of hydrogen atoms is `x + y = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane, so A and B must both have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   The problem states that there are no *conjugated* multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n    *   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6 ring compounds:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10): Has one double bond, not conjugated.\n        *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8): Has two double bonds which are conjugated. This is ruled out.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8): Has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds.\n    *   The two components of mixture X must therefore be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Let's check if this is consistent.\n        *   A = C6H10 (cyclohexene)\n        *   B = C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n        *   Total hydrogen atoms: `10 + 8 = 18`. This matches our atom balance.\n        *   Reaction: `C6H10 + C6H8 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`. This is a plausible hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction where the more unsaturated compound (diene) is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the less unsaturated one (monoene) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n        *   Since mixture X is equimolar, the reaction produces an equimolar mixture Y. All conditions are satisfied.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid and one molecule of the second liquid.\n    *   First liquid (cyclohexene): C6H10 has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Second liquid (1,4-cyclohexadiene): C6H8 has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
