    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope and has a close analog used in organic chemistry.**\n        *   \"Heavier isotope\" often points to deuterium (D or ²H), a stable, heavier isotope of hydrogen (H or ¹H).\n        *   \"Close analog used in organic chemistry\" suggests a common reagent where H can be substituted with D. Powerful reducing agents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) are excellent candidates. Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). Let's hypothesize that X is one of these.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G.**\n        *   LiAlH₄ is known to react extremely violently with water. So, let's assume the deuterated analog, LiAlD₄ (our candidate for X), also reacts violently.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n        *   Let's analyze the reaction of LiAlD₄ with a liquid Y.\n        *   If Y is normal water (H₂O): `LiAlD₄ + 4 H₂O -> LiOH + Al(OH)₃ + 4 HD`. The gas (W) is HD (hydrogen deuteride). Let's check its proton/neutron count. Protons = 1 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 2. Neutrons = 0 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 1. Protons ≠ Neutrons. This scenario is incorrect.\n        *   Let's consider another possibility for liquid Y. To produce a gas rich in deuterium, the reagent Y should also contain deuterium. The most common deuterated liquid is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   If Y is heavy water (D₂O): `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`. The gas (W) is D₂ (di-deuterium gas). Let's check its proton/neutron count. Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Protons = Neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly.\n        *   This establishes W as D₂ and Y as D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n        *   From our proposed reaction, the products in the solution are LiOD and Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), will also be a precipitate. So, G is Al(OD)₃.\n        *   When metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides) are heated, they decompose, releasing water (or heavy water). The reaction is: `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`.\n        *   So, the released substance B is D₂O (heavy water).\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   276.97 K is indeed \"very close to 277 K\". This strongly confirms that B is D₂O, G is Al(OD)₃, and our overall reaction scheme is correct.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). A simple example is pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH), which has 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   Our candidate for X is LiAlD₄, a powerful reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n        *   Reacting pyruvic acid with LiAlD₄ would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol, resulting in 1,2-propanediol (CH₃CH(OD)CH₂OD after deuterated workup, or CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH after H₂O workup).\n        *   The resulting molecule, a diol, contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This matches the clue exactly.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Identify the elements in X:** The substance is LiAlD₄. The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:** We compare the elements by their atomic number (Z):\n        *   Hydrogen (H): Z = 1\n        *   Lithium (Li): Z = 3\n        *   Aluminum (Al): Z = 13\n        *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n        *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum**.\n    *   **Calculate the cumulative mass for the lightest element:**\n        *   The lightest element is Hydrogen, which is present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H).\n        *   The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Cumulative mass = 4 atoms × 2 (mass per atom) = 8.\n    *   **Calculate the cumulative mass for the heaviest element:**\n        *   The heaviest element is Aluminum, which is present as 1 atom.\n        *   The stable and most common isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al.\n        *   The mass number of Aluminum is 27.\n        *   Cumulative mass = 1 atom × 27 (mass per atom) = 27.\n    *   **Calculate the final sum:**\n        *   The question asks for the sum of these two cumulative masses.\n        *   Total = (Cumulative mass of H) + (Cumulative mass of Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>"
