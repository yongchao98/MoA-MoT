    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic change in a star's velocity along our line of sight. This change is caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. This velocity change, $v_{r,star}$, causes a shift in the wavelength of the star's spectral lines, $\\Delta \\lambda$, described by the Doppler effect formula:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_{r,star}}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem provides the *amplitude* of the periodic wavelength shift for two planets. This amplitude, $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K_{star}$.\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Star Velocity Amplitude:**\n    For planet #1, $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ milliangstroms.\n    For planet #2, $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ milliangstroms.\n\n    The ratio of the stars' radial velocity amplitudes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Find the Relationship between Star Velocity Amplitude ($K_{star}$) and Orbital Period ($T$):**\n    For a circular orbit, the star's orbital speed is $v_{star} = \\frac{2 \\pi a_{star}}{T}$, where $a_{star}$ is the radius of the star's own small orbit around the system's barycenter and $T$ is the orbital period (which is the same for the star and the planet). The radial velocity amplitude is $K_{star} = v_{star} \\sin(i)$, where $i$ is the inclination of the orbit. We assume the inclination is the same for both systems, so we can write $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{a_{star}}{T}$.\n\n    From the conservation of momentum for the star-planet system, $M_{star} a_{star} = M_{planet} a_{planet}$, where $a_{planet}$ is the radius of the planet's orbit around the barycenter.\n\n    Since the problem states that the planet masses are much smaller than the star masses ($M_{Neptune} \\ll M_{Sun}$), the barycenter is very close to the star. Therefore, the semi-major axis of the planet's relative orbit, $a$, is approximately equal to the planet's orbit around the barycenter ($a \\approx a_{planet}$).\n    So, $a_{star} \\approx a \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}}$.\n\n    Now we substitute this into the expression for $K_{star}$:\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{1}{T} \\left( a \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} \\right)$\n\n    Next, we use Kepler's Third Law to relate the semi-major axis ($a$) and the period ($T$):\n    $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_{star} + M_{planet})} a^3$.\n    Since $M_{star} \\gg M_{planet}$, we can approximate $M_{star} + M_{planet} \\approx M_{star}$.\n    $T^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_{star}}$. This means $a^3 \\propto T^2 M_{star}$, so $a \\propto T^{2/3} M_{star}^{1/3}$.\n\n    Substitute this expression for $a$ back into the relation for $K_{star}$:\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{1}{T} \\left( (T^{2/3} M_{star}^{1/3}) \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} \\right)$\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{T^{2/3}}{T} \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    $K_{star} \\propto T^{-1/3} \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n\n4.  **Apply the Relationship to the Two Systems:**\n    The problem states that both stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and both planets have the same mass ($M_{planet1} = M_{planet2}$). Therefore, the term $\\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$ is a constant for both systems.\n    This leaves us with the key relationship:\n    $K_{star} \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n    This implies that $K_{star} \\cdot T^{1/3} = \\text{constant}$. We can therefore write:\n    $K_{star1} \\cdot T_1^{1/3} = K_{star2} \\cdot T_2^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}}$\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}}\\right)^3$\n\n    We already found that $\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    Plugging this value in:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\nTo find the numerical value, we compute $(5/7)^3$.\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio of the periods\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_ipython>\n0.3644314869096219\n</execute_ipython>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nOur calculated value of ~0.36 matches option D. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1 (i.e., it is shorter).\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the light from the host star. The shift in wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, $v_r$, along the line of sight:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem provides the amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift. This amplitude is proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K_{star}$.\n    *   For planet #1, $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ milliangstroms.\n    *   For planet #2, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ milliangstroms.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars is:\n    $\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Derive the relationship between Star Velocity Amplitude ($K_{star}$) and Orbital Period (T)**\n    The formula for the radial velocity amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K_{star} = \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}^2 + 2 M_{star} M_{planet} + M_{planet}^2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_{star}+M_{planet})}{a}}$\n    However, a simpler, more intuitive derivation can be used. We assume the orbits are viewed edge-on (sin(i) = 1, which is a common simplification unless stated otherwise. The ratio would be unaffected anyway as the viewing angles can be assumed to be similar on average).\n\n    For a circular orbit, from conservation of momentum, $M_{star} v_{star} = M_{planet} v_{planet}$.\n    The star's velocity amplitude is $K_{star} = v_{star}$.\n    Kepler's third law states: $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{G(M_{star} + M_{planet})}$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit relative to the star ($a=a_{star}+a_{planet}$), and $T$ is the orbital period.\n\n    Since the planets have masses similar to Neptune and the stars are similar to the Sun, we can use the approximation $M_{star} \\gg M_{planet}$. This simplifies Kepler's third law to:\n    $T^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{G M_{star}}$\n    This gives a relationship for the semi-major axis:\n    $a \\propto (M_{star} T^2)^{1/3}$\n\n    The velocity of the planet is $v_{planet} = \\frac{2\\pi a}{T}$. So, from momentum conservation:\n    $K_{star} = v_{star} = \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} v_{planet} = \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} \\frac{2\\pi a}{T}$\n\n    Now substitute the expression for $a$ into the equation for $K_{star}$:\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star} T} (M_{star} T^2)^{1/3}$\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star} T} M_{star}^{1/3} T^{2/3}$\n    $K_{star} \\propto M_{planet} M_{star}^{-2/3} T^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Apply the Relationship to the Two Systems**\n    The problem states that both stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and both planets have the same mass ($M_{planet1} = M_{planet2}$). Therefore, the terms $M_{planet}$ and $M_{star}^{-2/3}$ are the same for both systems.\n\n    This simplifies the relationship to:\n    $K_{star} \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n    We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}}\\right)^3$\n    And therefore:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}}\\right)^3$\n\n    We previously calculated $\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}} = \\frac{7}{5}$, so $\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    Plugging this value into our equation for the period ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value**\n    We need to compute the value of $(5/7)^3$.\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio of the periods\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_ipython>\n0.3644314869096219\n</execute_ipython>\nThe calculation gives approximately 0.364.

    "Here is a summary of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Star Velocity:** The observed periodic shift in a star's spectral line wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is a direct result of its radial velocity ($v_{r,star}$) caused by the orbiting planet.
