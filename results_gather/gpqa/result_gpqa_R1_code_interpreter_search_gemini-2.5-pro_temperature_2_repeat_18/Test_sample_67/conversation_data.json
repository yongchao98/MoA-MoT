    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1.  Define the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a 2-component vector (a spinor).\n*   The magnetic moment is given by the vector operator `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin angular momentum operator.\n*   Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the +Z direction, and its magnetic moment is aligned with this field. The interaction Hamiltonian is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_z`.\n*   For the moment to be aligned with the field, the particle must be in the lowest energy state of this Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down). The energies are `-γB(ħ/2)` and `-γB(-ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state corresponds to the spin-up state.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is the eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`, denoted as `|+Z>`. In the standard basis (where `S_z` is diagonal), this state is represented by the vector:\n    `|ψ(0)> = |+Z> = [1, 0]^T`\n\n### 2.  Define the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction, with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian `H'` governs the system for `t > 0`:\n    `H' = -μ ⋅ B' = -γ(B ĵ) ⋅ S = -γB S_y`\n    where `ĵ` is the unit vector in the y-direction.\n*   The time evolution of the quantum state is given by the Schrödinger equation, whose solution is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n*   Substituting `H'`, we get:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |+Z> = exp(iγBt S_y/ħ) |+Z>`\n*   Let's define the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`. The expression becomes:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iωt S_y/ħ) |+Z>`\n\n### 3.  Calculate the Time-Evolved State\n\n*   To proceed, we need the matrix representation of `S_y`. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices (`σ`) by `S = (ħ/2)σ`.\n    `S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n*   Substituting this into the time evolution operator:\n    `exp(iωt S_y/ħ) = exp(iωt (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(ωt/2) σ_y)`\n*   We use the general property of Pauli matrices, `exp(ia(n⋅σ)) = cos(a)I + isin(a)(n⋅σ)`, where `I` is the identity matrix. Here, `a = ωt/2` and `n⋅σ = σ_y`.\n    `exp(i(ωt/2) σ_y) = cos(ωt/2)I + isin(ωt/2)σ_y`\n*   Now we apply this operator to the initial state `|+Z>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = [cos(ωt/2)I + isin(ωt/2)σ_y] |+Z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = [cos(ωt/2) [[1,0],[0,1]] + isin(ωt/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]]] * [1,0]^T`\n    `|ψ(t)> = [ [[cos(ωt/2), -i²sin(ωt/2)], [isin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] ] * [1,0]^T` (Mistake in this line, let's recalculate)\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2) * [1,0]^T + isin(ωt/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]] * [1,0]^T`\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2) * [1,0]^T + isin(ωt/2) * [0, i]^T`\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2) * [1,0]^T - sin(ωt/2) * [0, 1]^T`\n    `|ψ(t)> = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]^T`\n\n### 4.  Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Moment\n\n*   The question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>`.\n    `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`\n*   The operator `μ_z` is `γS_z`.\n    `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n*   Let's calculate `<σ_z>` first.\n    `<σ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| σ_z |ψ(t)>`\n    The bra vector `<ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)>`, which is `[cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`.\n    `<σ_z>(t) = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]^T`\n    `<σ_z>(t) = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)]^T`\n    `<σ_z>(t) = cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)`\n*   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    `<σ_z>(t) = cos(2 * (ωt/2)) = cos(ωt)`\n*   Therefore, the expectation value of `μ_z` is:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)<σ_z>(t) = (γħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n\n### 5.  Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   The expression for `<μ_z>(t)` shows that it oscillates sinusoidally with time. The functional form is `cos(ωt)`.\n*   The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n*   Recalling our definition of the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n*   Thus, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n### Alternative Method: Larmor Precession\n\nA more intuitive way to understand this is through the concept of Larmor precession. The classical equation of motion for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is given by the torque equation:\n`dμ/dt = γ(μ x B)`\n\nThis equation describes the precession of the vector `μ` around the direction of the magnetic field `B` with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n*   At `t=0`, the expectation value of the magnetic moment is `<μ>(0) = (0, 0, γħ/2)`.\n*   For `t > 0`, the magnetic field is `B' = (0, B, 0)`.\n*   The vector `<μ>` will precess around the Y-axis. As it precesses, its tip will trace a circle in the X-Z plane.\n*   The Z-component of `<μ>`, which is `<μ_z>`, will oscillate as `cos(ωt)`, while the X-component will oscillate as `sin(ωt)`.\n*   The frequency of this precession (and thus the oscillation of its components) is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion. The oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
