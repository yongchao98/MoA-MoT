    "Here's my thinking process to solve this chemical puzzle.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the quantitative data.**\nThe most solid piece of information is the mass percentage of fluorine in substance A2, which is 31.96% (or 0.3196). A2 is a binary compound of an unknown element Y and fluorine (F). Let's denote its formula as YmFn. The atomic mass of Fluorine is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe formula for the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (m * M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nLet's assume the simplest stoichiometry, m=1, so A2 has the formula YFn.\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\nRearranging to solve for the atomic mass of Y, M(Y):\nM(Y) + 19n = 19n / 0.3196\nM(Y) + 19n ≈ 59.45n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n\nHere, 'n' is the number of fluorine atoms attached to one atom of Y, which is likely a small integer corresponding to a plausible oxidation state. Let's test integer values for 'n':\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. Candidates: Ar (39.9), K (39.1), Ca (40.1). None of these form the variety of compounds described.\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidate: Br (79.9), Se (79.0). Known bromine fluorides (BrF, BrF3, BrF5) don't have this F/Br ratio or matching fluorine percentage.\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. Candidate: Sb (Antimony, 121.76 g/mol). This is a very strong match.\n    Let's check the mass % for SbF3: %F = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188, or 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%. I will proceed with the hypothesis that Y = Sb and A2 = SbF3.\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. No common element fits well.\n*   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol. Candidates: Hg (200.6), Bi (209.0). BiF5 has a %F of 32.3%, which is also a possibility.\n\nLet's assume **Y = Sb (Antimony)** and **A2 = SbF3** due to the excellent mass percentage match.\n\n**Step 2: Reconstruct the identities of the other compounds based on the hypothesis.**\n*   **Y = Sb**\n*   **A2 = SbF3**\n\nNow let's use the other clues:\n1.  **A1 -> A2 + F2**: This means `A1 -> SbF3 + F2`. This is a decomposition reaction where a higher fluoride turns into a lower one. Therefore, A1 must be SbF5. The reaction is `SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2`.\n2.  **A1 is a bright-red substance & decomposes at 293 K (20°C)**: SbF5 is a colorless viscous liquid, not a bright-red solid. The decomposition `SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2` typically requires heating above 200°C. This is a major contradiction. However, in chemical problems of this type, sometimes a detail might be slightly altered or refer to a very specific, less-common form (e.g., an impure or complexed state). Given the strength of the mass match, I will note this contradiction but proceed, as other hypotheses have worse contradictions.\n3.  **A1 oxidizes xenon**: A1=SbF5. SbF5 is an extremely powerful Lewis acid and a component of the strongest superacids. It can react with Xenon fluorides, for example `XeF2 + 2SbF5 -> [XeF][Sb2F11]`. While direct oxidation of Xe by SbF5 alone is not as famous as with PtF6, it is plausible in the context of this being an advanced problem. So we'll tentatively accept A1=SbF5.\n4.  **A3 can also interact with xenon... A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y**: `Sb + F2 -> SbF3` or `SbF5`. Since A3 interacts with xenon, it must be a strong Lewis acid or oxidant. SbF5 is the much better candidate than SbF3. Therefore, **A3 = SbF5**. This is consistent with A1 being SbF5 as well. So, **A1 = A3 = SbF5**.\n5.  **Five binary compounds of fluorine with Y=Sb**: The two major ones are SbF3 and SbF5. Antimony can form polyanionic fluorides in salts (e.g., [SbF6]-, [Sb2F11]-), but the question implies neutral binary compounds (YxFn). This clue remains difficult to satisfy perfectly for antimony. We will assume the existence of other less stable or less common species for the sake of the puzzle.\n6.  **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"**: This translates to `Sb (Y) + A4 -> A5` (1:1 molar ratio). A4 is an antimony fluoride. \"Hot colorless concentrated solution\" is a perfect description of liquid SbF5 being used as a reactant and solvent. So, let's assume **A4 = SbF5**.\n7.  **The reaction is `Sb + SbF5 -> A5` (1:1 ratio)**. This is a comproportionation reaction. Antimony is in oxidation state 0, and in SbF5 it's in +5. What product A5 could be formed? A plausible product would be an intermediate oxidation state compound. The average oxidation state would be (0+5)/2 = +2.5. This points towards a compound with the empirical formula \"SbF2.5\", or Sb2F5. However, this is not a known stable binary fluoride. A more common product of the reaction between Sb and SbF5 is SbF3. The balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3`. This is a 2:3 ratio, not 1:1.\nThis suggests A5 is not a simple binary fluoride. It is likely a polyatomic cluster ion formed in the SbF5 solvent. The field of non-aqueous inorganic chemistry shows that reducing metal halides with the parent metal can form such clusters. However, a simpler interpretation could be that A5 is simply the resulting solution containing SbF3. But \"A5\" being obtainable implies it is a specific substance.\nLet's reconsider the products. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\n`SbF3 + 2H2O <=> SbOF + 2HF` (forms an oxyfluoride and hydrofluoric acid - two substances).\n`SbF5 + 3H2O -> SbO2F + 4HF` (or hydrated Sb2O5 and HF - two substances).\nThis clue fits multiple candidates.\nLet's stick with the most reasonable assignments from the clues.\n\n*   Y = Sb\n*   A1 = SbF5 (contradicts color/decomposition T)\n*   A2 = SbF3\n*   A3 = SbF5\n*   A4 = SbF5\n\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4.\nBased on our deduction, **A4 = SbF5**.\nLet's calculate its molecular weight:\nM(A4) = M(SbF5) = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F)\nM(A4) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 95.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\nThis value (216.76) falls within the range of 220-240 if we consider some rounding or that SbF5 exists as a cyclic pentamer (SbF5)5 or hexamer in the liquid phase, whose monomeric unit molecular weight is 216.76.\nThe ranges are:\nA) 220-240\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nMy calculated value is 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fit well in any range, being slightly below range A. Let's recheck the calculation and hypothesis. The initial step M(Y) ≈ 40.45n is the most certain part. The choice Y=Sb and A2=SbF3 has the by far best fit for this calculation.\nThe inconsistencies for Sb are properties of A1, and the number of fluorides.\nThe inconsistencies for other candidates (like Pt or Bi) are worse, primarily the mismatch in the fluorine percentage for A2.\n\nPerhaps A4 is a different fluoride. If A4=SbF3, M=178.76 (range D). But you can't add Sb metal to SbF3 to get another compound in a simple way, and SbF3 is a white solid, not a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". So A4 has to be SbF5.\n\nLet's assume the question and ranges are correct and see if we can resolve the discrepancy.\nWhat if A2 is actually `SbOF` with some contamination giving a slightly off F percentage? No, it's a decomposition product of a higher fluoride in F2.\nLet's trust the primary calculation:\n*   A2 = SbF3 (from mass %)\n*   A4 is a fluoride of Sb that can be a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". This must be SbF5.\n*   Molecular weight of SbF5 is 216.76 g/mol.\nWhy doesn't this fit neatly into the ranges? Let me recalculate with precise masses. M(Sb) = 121.760, M(F) = 18.9984. M(SbF5) = 121.760 + 5*18.9984 = 216.752 g/mol.\nThe range 220-240 starts at 220. My value is 216.75. This is close but not inside.\nLet's think if A4 could be a polyanion's salt or a solvate. E.g., [cation][SbF6]-? No, it's a binary compound of Y and F.\n\nMaybe the question implies the formula unit of the species in solution. In liquid SbF5, the structure is polymeric, based on cis-F-bridged SbF6 octahedra, [(SbF5)n]. Could A4 refer to the molecular weight of the solvated species in which the reaction occurs? Unlikely to be a straightforward interpretation.\n\nLet's reconsider Y=Bismuth.\nA2=BiF5 (%F=32.31%, close-ish to 31.96%). Then A1=BiF7? A3=BiF5. A4=? It needs to be a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". BiF5 is a white solid, not a liquid at mild heat (decomposes >150C). This path seems blocked.\n\nLet's return to Y=Sb and A4=SbF5. M=216.76 g/mol.\nLet's review the problem for any subtlety. The substance A1 being bright-red that decomposes to A2 and Fluorine is key. While SbF5 is colorless, some fluorine compounds are colored (PtF6 is deep red, CrF5 is red, RuF5 is dark green). This points to a transition metal.\nIf Y=Cr (has CrF2,3,4,5,6 - five fluorides!), M=52.0. Then M(Y)=40.45n => n = 52.0/40.45 = 1.28. Doesn't work.\nIf Y=Ru (forms RuF3, RuF4, RuF5, RuF6), M=101.1. Then M(Y)=40.45n => n=101.1/40.45=2.5. Doesn't work.\nIf Y=Os, M=190.2. Then n=190.2/40.45 = 4.7. Close to 5. OsF5 could be A2? Let's check. M(OsF5) = 190.2+5*19 = 285.2. %F = 95/285.2 = 33.3%. A bit far from 31.96%.\n\nThe antimony hypothesis remains the most mathematically sound despite the color discrepancy. It is possible this is an error in the problem statement or it refers to an unusual state of SbF5. Given A4 is SbF5 with a molecular weight of 216.76 g/mol, the range A) 220-240 is the closest possible answer. The problem might involve an adduct or cluster in solution whose mass falls into this range, but the monomer mass is the most likely intended answer. For example, if A4 is used as a solution in HF, the species might be H+SbF6-, with a mass of 1+19+216.76. No. The species is SbF5. There is no other plausible identity for A4 given the strong evidence for Y=Sb.\n\nLet me trust the deduction that A4=SbF5 and M=216.76. This is very close to 220. Let's choose the closest range. This would be A. Let's reconsider the starting element search. A slight experimental error on the 31.96% value can change things.\nWhat if Y is Krypton, M=83.8. A2=KrF2. %F = 38/121.8 = 31.2%. Very close. But adding Kr gas to a solution of A4 doesn't make sense chemically. So, not Kr.\n\nIt seems I must stick with A4 = SbF5. M.Wt=216.76 g/mol. Let's select the range it is closest to, or which might contain it with slight problem inaccuracies. 216.76 is functionally 'at the edge' of the 220-240 range. No other range is remotely close.\nRange A) 220-240 (misses by 1.5%)\nRange B) 140-160\nRange C) 110-130\nRange D) 160-180 (contains SbF3, but A4 can't be SbF3).\n\nGiven the choices, it's most likely that A4 is SbF5 and the answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
