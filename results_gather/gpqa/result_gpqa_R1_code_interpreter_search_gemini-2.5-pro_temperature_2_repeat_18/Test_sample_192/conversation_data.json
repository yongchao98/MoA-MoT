    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Input:**\n    *   We are given a relationship between the number of stars and their parallax (`plx`). Let's denote the number of stars as `N` and the parallax as `p`. The relationship is stated as \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\".\n    *   This phrasing describes a distribution. In physics and astronomy, such a statement usually refers to the number density of objects with respect to a given variable. So, we interpret the given information as the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, `dN/dp`, being proportional to `1/p^5`.\n    *   Mathematically: `dN/dp ∝ 1/p^5` or `dN/dp = k * p^-5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    *   The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`), specifically \"per unit range of distance\".\n    *   This corresponds to the quantity `dN/dr`, which is the number of stars per unit interval of distance.\n\n3.  **Find the Core Physical Relationship:**\n    *   The parallax `p` of a star is inversely proportional to its distance `r`. The standard formula is `p = 1/r`, where `r` is in parsecs and `p` is in arcseconds.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Mathematical Problem:**\n    *   We need to find the relationship for `dN/dr` given the relationship for `dN/dp`. This is a classic change of variables problem for a distribution function.\n    *   We can relate `dN/dr` and `dN/dp` using the chain rule:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/dp) * (dp/dr)`\n    *   Since a distribution must be non-negative, and `dp/dr` is negative (as distance increases, parallax decreases), we use the absolute value of the Jacobian (the derivative term) for the transformation:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/dp) * |dp/dr|`\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   **Step a:** Find the derivative `dp/dr`.\n        Since `p = r^-1`, `dp/dr = d/dr(r^-1) = -1 * r^-2 = -1/r^2`.\n    *   **Step b:** Find the absolute value of the derivative.\n        `|dp/dr| = |-1/r^2| = 1/r^2`.\n    *   **Step c:** Substitute the known expressions into the chain rule formula.\n        `dN/dr ∝ (p^-5) * (1/r^2)`.\n    *   **Step d:** Express the right side entirely in terms of `r`. We know `p = 1/r`, so we substitute this into the expression.\n        `dN/dr ∝ ((1/r)^-5) * (1/r^2)`\n    *   **Step e:** Simplify the expression.\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (r^-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to the cube of the distance, `r^3`.\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   The result `~ r^3` corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
