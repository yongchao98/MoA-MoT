    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n\n*   **λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n    This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. In this scenario, all particles (the gas molecules) are in random thermal motion. The standard formula from the kinetic theory of gases for this case is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule.\n    *   The `√2` factor is crucial. It arises from averaging over the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities for *all* colliding particles, accounting for their relative motion.\n\n*   **λ2: Mean Free Path of an Electron**\n    This refers to the average distance an electron from the TEM beam travels before scattering off a gas molecule. In this scenario, we have a very high-speed projectile (the electron) moving through a collection of comparatively slow-moving targets (the gas molecules).\n    *   The electron is accelerated by 1000 kV, giving it extremely high velocity (a significant fraction of the speed of light).\n    *   The gas molecules have only their normal thermal velocities, which are orders of magnitude smaller.\n    *   Because the electron is so much faster, the gas molecules can be considered **stationary targets**.\n\n    When the targets are stationary, the formula for the mean free path simplifies, and the `√2` factor is not present:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule.\n\n### **2. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo find the relationship between λ2 and λ1, let's take their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n### **3. Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nNow we need to consider the relationship between the molecule-molecule cross-section (σ_gg) and the electron-molecule cross-section (σ_eg).\n\n*   **Simplifying Assumption:** In many physics problems of this type, the primary concept being tested is the difference in the physics of motion (the `√2` factor). If we make the simplifying assumption that the effective cross-sections are approximately equal (i.e., σ_gg ≈ σ_eg), then the equation becomes:\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2\n    Since √2 ≈ 1.414, this means λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1.\n\n*   **Geometric Model:** We can also use a simple geometric (hard-sphere) model.\n    *   **σ_gg:** For two molecules of diameter `d` to collide, the center of one must come within a distance `d` of the other. The cross-sectional area is a circle of radius `d`, so **σ_gg = πd²**.\n    *   **σ_eg:** For a point-like electron to collide with a molecule of diameter `d` (radius `r = d/2`), it must hit the geometric profile of the molecule. The cross-sectional area is a circle of radius `r`, so **σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd²**.\n    *   Therefore, in this model, σ_gg = 4 * σ_eg.\n    *   Substituting this into our ratio equation:\n        λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg) = √2 * (4 * σ_eg / σ_eg) = 4√2\n    *   In this case, λ2 ≈ 4 * 1.414 * λ1 = 5.66 * λ1.\n\n### **4. Draw a Conclusion**\n\nBoth analyses, despite their different assumptions about the cross-section, lead to the same conclusion: **λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.**\n\n*   The first analysis gives λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1.\n*   The second analysis gives λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\nA) λ2 < λ1  (False)\nB) λ2 = λ1  (False)\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (False, as both 1.414 and 5.66 are greater than 1.22)\nD) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (True, as both 1.414 and 5.66 are greater than or equal to 1.22)\n\nThe fundamental physical difference is that the fast electron travels through a gas of effectively stationary targets, which reduces its collision frequency compared to a gas molecule moving among its peers. This leads to a longer mean free path. Both simple models show that λ2 is at least √2 times λ1. The value 1.22 is chosen to be a threshold that is clearly smaller than √2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
