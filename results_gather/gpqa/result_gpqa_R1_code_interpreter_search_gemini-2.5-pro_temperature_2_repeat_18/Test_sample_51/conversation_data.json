This information is not needed for the core calculation, as the problem only concerns the temperatures and the energy levels.\n    *   **Core Question:** Find `Factor = (Ratio at T_1) / (Ratio at T_2)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics Principle:**\n    *   The problem mentions the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels and assumes LTE. This immediately points to the **Boltzmann equation**.\n    *   The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio `(n_j / n_i)` of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` to a lower state `i`:\n        `n_j / n_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]`\n    *   Where:\n        *   `n_j`, `n_i` are the number densities of atoms in the respective energy levels.\n        *   `g_j`, `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n        *   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels (`ΔE`).\n        *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n        *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Set up the Calculation:**\n    *   Let `Ratio_1` be the population ratio at `T_1 = 6000 K`.\n        `Ratio_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n    *   Let `Ratio_2` be the population ratio at `T_2 = 5500 K`.\n        `Ratio_2 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n    *   The factor we need is `Factor = Ratio_1 / Ratio_2`.\n        `Factor = [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] ] / [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]`\n    *   The statistical weights `(g_2 / g_1)` are constant for the given levels and will cancel out.\n        `Factor = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n    *   Using the exponent rule `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n        `Factor = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T_1) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n        `Factor = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T_1) + ΔE / (k * T_2) ]`\n    *   Factoring out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n        `Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (`ΔE`):**\n    *   The problem gives the wavelength (`λ`) of the photon associated with the transition between the two energy levels.

    "*   **Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the core physics principle:** The problem asks about the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels at different temperatures, assuming the system (the stellar photosphere) is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The physical law that governs this is the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an upper energy level (let's call it level 2) to a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n    \n    `N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    \n    where:\n    *   `N₂`, `N₁` are the number of atoms in level 2 and level 1.\n    *   `g₂`, `g₁` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels (`E₂ - E₁`).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the absolute temperature.\n\n3.  **Set up the ratios for the two scenarios:**\n    *   Let `Ratio₁` be the population ratio when the star has no spots, at temperature `T₁ = 6000 K`.\n        `Ratio₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))`\n    *   Let `Ratio₂` be the population ratio when the star has spots, at temperature `T₂ = 5500 K`.\n        `Ratio₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\n4.  **Determine what the question is asking for:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes *when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots*. This means we need to calculate `Factor = Ratio₁ / Ratio₂`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the factor:**\n    \n    `Factor = Ratio₁ / Ratio₂ = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]`\n    \n    The term for the statistical weights, `(g₂ / g₁)`, is a constant property of the specific atomic levels and cancels out.\n    \n    `Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n    \n    Using the exponent rule `eᵃ / eᵇ = e^(a-b)`:\n    \n    `Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]`\n    `Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`\n\n6.  **Calculate the energy difference, ΔE:** The energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`. The formula for photon energy is `ΔE = h * c / λ`.\n    \n    *   `h` = Planck's constant\n    *   `c` = speed of light\n    *   `λ` = wavelength (must be converted from Ångströms to meters)\n\n7.  **Plan for Numerical Calculation:** The expression involves multiple physical constants and exponentiation, making it suitable for a small program to ensure accuracy.\n\n    *   **Inputs:** `T₁ = 6000 K`, `T₂ = 5500 K`, `λ = 1448 Å`.\n    *   **Constants:** `h`, `c`, `k`.\n    *   **Calculation steps:**\n        1.  Convert `λ` to meters.\n        2.  Calculate `ΔE = h * c / λ`.\n        3.  Substitute `ΔE`, `k`, `T₁`, and `T₂` into the factor equation `exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`.\n        4.  Print the result.\n\n8.  **Execute the code:**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define physical constants in SI units\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant (J·s)\nc = 299792458       # Speed of light (m/s)\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\n\n# Given information from the problem\n# Temperature without spots (T1) and with spots (T2)\nT1 = 6000  # K\nT2 = 5500  # K\n\n# Wavelength of the transition\nlambda_angstrom = 1448\nlambda_meters = lambda_angstrom * 1e-10  # Convert Ångströms to meters\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (ΔE) for the transition\ndelta_E = (h * c) / lambda_meters\n\n# Calculate the term ΔE/k, also known as the characteristic temperature of the transition\ndelta_E_over_k = delta_E / k\n\n# Calculate the factor by which the ratio changes: Ratio(T1) / Ratio(T2)\n# Factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]\nfactor = math.exp(delta_E_over_k * (1/T2 - 1/T1))\n\nprint(factor)\n```\nThe Python script calculates the numerical value of the factor based on the derived formula and the provided data.
