    "This problem asks for the energy threshold of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) that can annihilate with a low-energy Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$). The reaction is:\n\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$\n\nTo solve this, we will use the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum and the concept of invariant mass.\n\n1.  **Four-Momentum Conservation**:\n    Let the four-momenta of the initial particles be $p_1$ (for the high-energy gamma-ray) and $p_2$ (for the CMB photon). The four-momenta of the final particles are $p_{e^+}$ (for the positron) and $p_{e^-}$ (for the electron).\n    The conservation of four-momentum states:\n    $p_1 + p_2 = p_{e^+} + p_{e^-}$\n\n2.  **Invariant Mass**:\n    The square of the total four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames. Let's call this invariant $s$.\n    $s = (p_1 + p_2)^2 = (p_{e^+} + p_{e^-})^2$\n\n3.  **Calculating the Invariant Mass ($s$)**:\n    *   **Initial state (Lab frame)**: We expand $(p_1 + p_2)^2$.\n        $(p_1 + p_2)^2 = p_1^2 + p_2^2 + 2p_1 \\cdot p_2$\n        Since photons are massless, the square of their four-momentum is zero ($p^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2c^2 = 0$). So, $p_1^2 = 0$ and $p_2^2 = 0$.\n        The dot product $p_1 \\cdot p_2 = E_1 E_2 - \\vec{p}_1 \\cdot \\vec{p}_2$. For photons, $|\\vec{p}|c=E$, so $\\vec{p}_1 \\cdot \\vec{p}_2 = E_1 E_2 \\cos\\theta / c^2$. In natural units (c=1), this is $E_1 E_2 \\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two photons.\n        Thus, $s = 2E_1 E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n    *   **Final state (Center-of-Mass frame)**: The threshold energy corresponds to the minimum energy required to create the electron-positron pair. This happens when the electron and positron are created at rest in their center-of-mass (CM) frame.\n        In the CM frame, the total momentum is zero ($\\vec{p}_{e^+} + \\vec{p}_{e^-} = \\vec{0}$). The total energy at threshold is the sum of the rest energies of the electron and positron: $E_{CM} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$.\n        The invariant mass squared is $s = (E_{CM}/c^2)^2 c^2 - |\\vec{P}_{CM}|^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2$. In natural units (c=1), this simplifies to $s = (2m_e)^2 = 4m_e^2$.\n\n4.  **Finding the Threshold Energy ($E_1$)**:\n    Equating the two expressions for the invariant $s$:\n    $2E_1 E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta) = 4m_e^2$\n\n    To find the minimum possible energy $E_1$ for this reaction to occur, we need to consider the most efficient collision geometry. The term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized when the collision is head-on, meaning the photons travel in opposite directions ($\\theta = \\pi$ or $180^\\circ$). In this case, $\\cos\\theta = -1$, and the term becomes $(1 - (-1)) = 2$.\n    The equation for the threshold condition becomes:\n    $2E_1 E_2 (2) = 4m_e^2$\n    $4E_1 E_2 = 4m_e^2$\n    $E_1 E_2 = (m_e c^2)^2$\n\n    Solving for the high-energy photon's threshold energy $E_1$:\n    $E_1 = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}$\n\n5.  **Calculation**:\n    We are given the following values:\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_2 = 10^{-3}$ eV.\n    *   Rest energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6$ eV.\n\n    Now, we plug these values into the equation:\n    $E_1 = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n    To perform the calculation, a simple script can be used:\n    ```python\n    # Define the constants in eV\n    m_e_ev = 0.511 * 1e6  # Electron rest energy in eV (0.511 MeV)\n    E2_ev = 1e-3         # CMB photon energy in eV\n    \n    # Calculate the threshold energy E1 in eV\n    E1_ev = m_e_ev**2 / E2_ev\n    \n    # Convert the result from eV to GeV (1 GeV = 1e9 eV)\n    E1_gev = E1_ev / 1e9\n    \n    print(E1_gev)\n    ```\n    Executing this code yields the result:\n    ```\n    261121.0\n    ```\n    The threshold energy is approximately $261,121$ GeV.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    The calculated threshold energy is $E_1 \\approx 2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV. Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\n    B) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\n    C) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\n    D) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n\n    The value $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV is closest to option C. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies at or above this threshold will have their lifetimes in the universe limited by pair production with CMB photons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
