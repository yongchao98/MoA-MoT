    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\nThe problem states that the two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Let's break this down:\n*   $l_1 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (since it's in a p-orbital).\n*   $l_2 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a p-orbital).\n*   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n*   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This means the eigenvalue of the total z-angular momentum operator, $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$, is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### 2. Understanding the Measurement\n\nWe are performing a measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, represented by the operators $\\hat{L}_{1z}$ and $\\hat{L}_{2z}$. The possible results of these measurements are given by the eigenvalues $m_{l1}\\hbar$ and $m_{l2}\\hbar$, where $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ are the magnetic quantum numbers for each electron. Since $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$, the possible values for both $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ are -1, 0, and +1.\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of getting the following specific outcomes:\n*   The eigenvalue of $\\hat{L}_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to $m_{l1} = -1$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $\\hat{L}_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nThis measurement outcome corresponds to the system being found in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Applying Quantum Mechanics Principles\n\nThe probability of finding the system in a specific state (the \"measured state\") after a measurement, given that it was initially in another state (the \"initial state\"), is the squared magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states.\n\n*   Initial State: $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ (in the coupled basis).\n*   Measured State: $|\\psi_{measured}\\rangle = |m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$ (in the uncoupled basis).\n\nThe probability $P$ is given by:\n$P = |\\langle \\psi_{measured} | \\psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is known as a **Clebsch-Gordan coefficient**.\n\n### 4. Using the Conservation of Angular Momentum (The Selection Rule)\n\nA fundamental rule in the addition of angular momentum is that the total z-component is the sum of the individual z-components. That is, $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\nLet's check this condition for our problem:\n*   For the initial state, $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   For the desired measured state, $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$. The sum is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) is not equal to the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers of the measured state ($m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$), the projection of the initial state onto the measured state must be zero.\n\nThis is a key selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients: The coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$ is non-zero only if $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\nIn our case, $-1 \\neq -2$, so the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n$\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\n### 5. An Alternative Viewpoint: Orthogonality of Eigenstates\n\nThe initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-angular momentum operator $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n$\\hat{L}_z |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle = -1\\hbar |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$\n\nThe state we are trying to measure, $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, is also an eigenstate of $\\hat{L}_z$. Let's find its eigenvalue:\n$\\hat{L}_z |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle = (\\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z})|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$\n$= (\\hat{L}_{1z}|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle) + (\\hat{L}_{2z}|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle)$\n$= (-1\\hbar|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle) + (-1\\hbar|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle)$\n$= -2\\hbar|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$\n\nSo, we have two states that are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($\\hat{L}_z$) but correspond to different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$). A fundamental theorem of linear algebra and quantum mechanics states that such eigenstates must be orthogonal.\n\nOrthogonality means their inner product is zero:\n$\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\nThe probability, being the square of this value, is also zero. This measurement outcome is impossible because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
