    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound and Substituents**\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** The core is a benzene ring.\n*   **Functional Groups/Substituents:**\n    *   Carboxylic acid: -COOH\n    *   Carbaldehyde: -CHO (named as a prefix 'formyl')\n    *   Cyano group: -CN (named as a prefix 'cyano')\n    *   Hydroxyl group: -OH (named as a prefix 'hydroxy')\n    *   Dimethylamino group: -N(CH₃)₂ (named as a prefix 'dimethylamino')\n    *   Methoxy group: -OCH₃ (named as a prefix 'methoxy')\n\n**2. Determine the Principal Functional Group**\n\nAccording to IUPAC rules, functional groups are ranked in priority to determine the parent name of the molecule. The priority order for the groups present is:\nCarboxylic acid > Carbaldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino > Ether\nThe carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the highest priority group. Therefore, the molecule is named as a derivative of benzoic acid.\n\n**3. Draw the Structure and Number the Ring**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We will build the structure on a benzene ring based on the relative positions given.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Assign C1.** The carbon atom attached to the principal functional group (-COOH) is designated as C1.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Place the groups relative to C1.**\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is *para* to the carboxylic acid. Para is position 4 relative to C1. So, -OCH₃ is on C4.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. Ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ are on C2 and C6 (we don't know which is where yet).\n    *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO) and a cyano (-CN) group are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. Meta positions are C3 and C5. So, -CHO and -CN are on C3 and C5 (again, we need more information to place them).\n\n*   **Step 3c: Use the final constraint to resolve ambiguity.**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   We know the methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at C4.\n    *   We know the alcohol (-OH) is at either C2 or C6.\n    *   We know the nitrile (-CN) is at either C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The description says methoxy (at C4) and the alcohol (-OH) are ortho to the nitrile. For this to be true, the alcohol must be at C2. This works perfectly.\n        *   **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. For the methoxy (at C4) and the alcohol to be ortho to the nitrile, the alcohol must be at C6. This also works.\n\n*   **Step 3d: Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules.**\n    We have two potential numbering schemes which are mirror images of each other. We must number the ring starting from C1 to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the substituents.\n\n    *   **Scheme 1 (from Case 1):** Numbering clockwise gives:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH\n        *   C3: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH₃\n        *   C5: -CHO\n        *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂\n        *   Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    *   **Scheme 2 (from Case 2):** Numbering counter-clockwise gives:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂\n        *   C3: -CHO\n        *   C4: -OCH₃\n        *   C5: -CN\n        *   C6: -OH\n        *   Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    Since both numbering directions yield the same locant set, we use a tie-breaker rule: The numbering is chosen that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n**4. Alphabetize Substituents and Finalize Numbering**\n\n*   The substituent prefixes are: `cyano`, `dimethylamino`, `formyl`, `hydroxy`, `methoxy`.\n*   In alphabetical order:\n    1.  **C**yano\n    2.  **D**imethylamino (alphabetized under 'd')\n    3.  **F**ormyl\n    4.  **H**ydroxy\n    5.  **M**ethoxy\n*   Now we compare the locants for the first group in the alphabetical list, \"cyano\":\n    *   In Scheme 1, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Scheme 2, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Scheme 1 is the correct IUPAC numbering.**\n\nThe correct assignments are:\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   3-cyano\n*   4-methoxy\n*   5-formyl\n*   6-dimethylamino\n\n**5. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\n\nList the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **3-cyano**-\n*   **6-dimethylamino**-\n*   **5-formyl**-\n*   **2-hydroxy**-\n*   **4-methoxy**-\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nCombining them:\n`3-cyano-6-dimethylamino-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid`\n(Note: IUPAC recommendations often place parentheses around complex substituent names like dimethylamino for clarity, making it 6-(dimethylamino)).\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid -> Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid -> Prefixes are not in alphabetical order.\n*   **C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** -> This name correctly lists the substituents in alphabetical order (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy) and uses the correct locants (3, 6, 5, 2, 4) based on IUPAC rules.\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid -> Prefixes are not in alphabetical order.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
