    "*   **Analysis of the concept:** The question is about \"regularization at high energies.\" This is a procedure used in quantum field theory (QFT) to handle infinities that arise in calculations, specifically in loop diagrams. These infinities, known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences, occur when integrating over all possible momenta of virtual particles, and the integral \"blows up\" at very high momenta (high energies). Regularization is a mathematical trick to make these integrals temporarily finite so that calculations can proceed, before a related step called renormalization is used to yield physically meaningful, finite answers. A theory that \"never requires regularization\" would be one that is \"UV finite,\" meaning its calculations do not produce these high-energy infinities in the first place.\n\n*   **Evaluating the options:**\n    *   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum theory of electromagnetism. It is a cornerstone of the Standard Model of particle physics. When calculating quantities in QED, such as the correction to the electron's mass or magnetic moment, one encounters loop diagrams that lead to divergent integrals. These require regularization and renormalization to be solved. Thus, QED requires regularization.\n    *   **B) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify all fundamental forces of nature, including gravity. A key motivation and feature of string theory is that it is believed to be UV finite. Instead of point-like particles, the fundamental objects are one-dimensional strings. The interactions between these strings are \"smeared out\" over a small region, which smooths out the point-like interactions of QFTs. This \"smearing\" has the effect of taming the high-energy behavior of loop amplitudes, and calculations are expected to yield finite results without the need for regularization.\n    *   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory is governed by Maxwell's equations. While it is a classical theory and doesn't have the quantum loop divergences of QFT, it suffers from its own high-energy/short-distance problem. The self-energy of a classical point charge is infinite. If you calculate the energy stored in the electric field of an idealized point particle, the energy integral diverges as you approach the particle's center (r -> 0). This signals a breakdown of the theory at short distances (i.e., high energies). Handling this problem requires modifying the theory, for instance by assuming the charge is not a point but has a finite size, which is a form of regularization.\n    *   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the quantum theory of the strong nuclear force, which binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons. Like QED, it is a QFT and is part of the Standard Model. Calculations in QCD involve loop diagrams with quarks and gluons, which also lead to UV divergences. Therefore, QCD definitely requires regularization and renormalization.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Among the given options, QED, QCD, and Classical Electrodynamics all suffer from infinities at high energies (or short distances) that must be addressed, a process which is either formally called regularization or is analogous to it. Superstring Theory is the only one on the list that is constructed with the specific aim of being free from these high-energy divergences, and is thus believed not to require regularization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
