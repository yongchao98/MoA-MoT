    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Define Given Information and Goals**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus at rest with mass M.\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** E_initial = M * c² = 300 GeV.\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments with rest-masses m1 and m2.\n    *   m1 is the more massive fragment: m1 = 2 * m2.\n    *   The sum of fragment rest-masses: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) using relativistic physics and classical physics.\n    *   Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Masses and Q-value**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments (m1*c² and m2*c²) and the total kinetic energy released (the Q-value of the reaction).\n\n*   **Sum of fragment rest-mass energies:**\n    (m1 + m2) * c² = 0.99 * (M * c²)\n    (m1 + m2) * c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV\n\n*   **Individual fragment rest-mass energies:**\n    We know m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²). Substituting this into the sum:\n    2*(m2*c²) + (m2*c²) = 297 GeV\n    3 * (m2*c²) = 297 GeV\n    **m2*c² = 99 GeV**\n    Therefore, **m1*c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**.\n\n*   **Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    The total kinetic energy released (Q) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energy. This energy is distributed between the two fragments.\n    Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c² + m2*c²)\n    Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**.\n\n### **3. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by T = p²/2m.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum is zero. The two fragments must fly apart in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.\n    p_initial = p_final = 0\n    p1 + p2 = 0  =>  |p1| = |p2| = p\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy Ratio:** We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    T1_classical / T2_classical = (p²/2m1) / (p²/2m2) = m2 / m1\n    Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is:\n    T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2  =>  T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\n\n*   **Solve for T1_classical:**\n    We know the total kinetic energy is T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV.\n    T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV\n    3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n    **T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV**\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nFor the relativistic case, we use the energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   **Conservation Laws:**\n    1.  Conservation of Energy: E1 + E2 = M*c² = 300 GeV\n        *   Where E1 and E2 are the *total* energies (rest-mass + kinetic) of the fragments.\n    2.  Conservation of Momentum: |p1| = |p2|\n\n*   **Using the Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    From E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², we get (pc)² = E² - (mc²)².\n    Since |p1| = |p2|, we have (p1c)² = (p2c)².\n    E1² - (m1*c²)² = E2² - (m2*c²)²\n\n*   **Solve for the Total Energy of Fragment 1 (E1):**\n    From energy conservation, we have E2 = M*c² - E1. Substitute this into the equation above:\n    E1² - (m1*c²)² = (M*c² - E1)² - (m2*c²)²\n    E1² - (m1*c²)² = (M*c²)² - 2*E1*(M*c²) + E1² - (m2*c²)²\n    *Cancel E1² from both sides:*\n    -(m1*c²)² = (M*c²)² - 2*E1*(M*c²) - (m2*c²)²\n    *Rearrange to solve for E1:*\n    2*E1*(M*c²) = (M*c²)² + (m1*c²)² - (m2*c²)²\n    E1 = [ (M*c²)² + (m1*c²)² - (m2*c²)² ] / [ 2 * (M*c²) ]\n\n*   **Plug in the values:**\n    E1 = [ (300)² + (198)² - (99)² ] / [ 2 * 300 ]\n    E1 = [ 90000 + 39204 - 9801 ] / 600\n    E1 = 119403 / 600\n    E1 = 199.005 GeV\n\n*   **Find the Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_relativistic):**\n    The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\n    T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c²\n    T1_relativistic = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n    **T1_relativistic = 1005 MeV**\n\n### **5.

    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand and Define the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy `E_initial` is given as `M * c² = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial kinetic energy is 0 and its initial momentum is 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Relationship between masses:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m1` be the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Sum of final masses:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe can express the relationships in terms of rest-mass energy:\n*   `m1*c² = 2 * m2*c²`\n*   `m1*c² + m2*c² = 0.99 * (M*c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nNow, substitute the first equation into the second to solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n*   `(2 * m2*c²) + (m2*c²) = 297 GeV`\n*   `3 * m2*c² = 297 GeV`\n*   `m2*c² = 99 GeV`\n*   `m1*c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`) is 198 GeV, and the lighter one (`m2`) is 99 GeV.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\nThe total kinetic energy (`Q`) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This energy is distributed between the two fragments (`Q = T1 + T2`).\n*   `Q = E_initial - (m1*c² + m2*c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus was at rest (momentum = 0). Therefore, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`\n*   We can set up a ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p² / 2m1) / (p² / 2m2) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy:\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `|p1| = |p2|`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`T + mc²`).\n*   From the relation, `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`. Since the momenta are equal, we have:\n    `E1² - (m1*c²)² = E2² - (m2*c²)²`\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy (rest + kinetic) is conserved.\n    `E_initial = E_final` => `M*c² = E1 + E2`.\n*   From this, we can write `E2 = M*c² - E1`. Now substitute this into the momentum equation:\n    `E1² - (m1*c²)² = (M*c² - E1)² - (m2*c²)²`\n    `E1² - (m1*c²)² = (M*c²)² - 2*E1*(M*c²) + E1² - (m2*c²)²`\n*   Cancel `E1²` and rearrange to solve for `E1`:\n    `2*E1*(M*c²) = (M*c²)² + (m1*c²)² - (m2*c²)²`\n    `E1 = [ (M*c²)² + (m1*c²)² - (m2*c²)² ] / [ 2 * (M*c²) ]`\n*   Plug in the energy values in GeV:\n    `E1 = [ (300)² + (198)² - (99)² ] / [ 2 * 300 ]`\n    `E1 = [ 90000 + 39204 - 9801 ] / 600`\n    `E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`\n*   The relativistic kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c²`:\n    `T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n    `T1_relativistic = 1005 MeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value:\n*   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n```python\n# Values in GeV\nMc2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate fragment rest-mass energies based on the problem statement\n# m1c2 + m2c2 = 0.99 * Mc2\n# m1c2 = 2 * m2c2\n# Solving this system gives:\nm2c2 = (0.99 * Mc2) / 3.0\nm1c2 = 2.0 * m2c2\n\n# Total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Calculate T1 using classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n# In classical mechanics, T1 = Q * m2/(m1+m2)\nT1_classical_GeV = Q * m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Calculate T1 using relativistic mechanics\n# First, find the total energy E1 of the massive fragment\nE1 = (Mc2**2 + m1c2**2 - m2c2**2) / (2.0 * Mc2)\n# The relativistic kinetic energy is T1_rel = E1 - m1*c^2\nT1_relativistic_GeV = E1 - m1c2\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV) * 1000.0\n\nprint(f\"{difference_MeV:.0f}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\nIts rest-mass energy is `M*c² = 300 GeV`.\n\nIt splits into two fragments, m1 and m2.\nWe are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\nThe sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nLet's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n`m1*c² + m2*c² = 0.99 * M*c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\nSince `m1*c² = 2 * m2*c²`, we can substitute this into the equation:\n`2*m2*c² + m2*c² = 297 GeV`\n`3*m2*c² = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c² = 99 GeV`\nAnd therefore, `m1*c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n`Q = T1 + T2 = (M*c²) - (m1*c² + m2*c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation:**\nBy conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus is at rest, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `p1 = p2 = p`.\nThe classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\nSo, `T1 = p² / (2*m1)` and `T2 = p² / (2*m2)`.\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is `T1/T2 = m2/m1 = m2/(2*m2) = 1/2`.\nSo, `T2 = 2*T1`.\nWe know that `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\nSubstituting `T2 = 2*T1`, we get `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV`, which gives `3*T1 = 3 GeV`.\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**Relativistic Calculation:**\nConservation of total energy: `E_initial = E_final` -> `M*c² = E1 + E2`, where E1 and E2 are the total energies (rest + kinetic) of the fragments. So, `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`.\nConservation of momentum: `p1 = p2`.\nUsing the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, we have `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\nSince `p1 = p2`, we have `p1² = p2²`, and therefore `(p1*c)² = (p2*c)²`.\n`E1² - (m1*c²)² = E2² - (m2*c²)²`\nWe also know `E2 = 300 - E1`. Substituting this in:\n`E1² - (198)² = (300 - E1)² - (99)²`\n`E1² - 39204 = 90000 - 600*E1 + E1² - 9801`\nCancel `E1²` from both sides:\n`-39204 = 80199 - 600*E1`\n`600*E1 = 80199 + 39204`\n`600*E1 = 119403`\n`E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`.\nThis is the total energy of the massive fragment.
