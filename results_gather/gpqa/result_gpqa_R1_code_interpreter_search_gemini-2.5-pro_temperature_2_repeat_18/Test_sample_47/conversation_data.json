    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone (a cyclic ketone) and Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate. One of the α-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Structure of Cyclohexanone:** A six-membered ring with a carbonyl group (C=O). The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (C2 and C6) are the α-carbons, and they are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** A bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen on one of the α-carbons. The product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-bromocyclohexanone and a strong base (NaOH) with heat.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. This rearrangement occurs with α-halo ketones that have at least one α'-hydrogen (a hydrogen on the other α-carbon).\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic α'-hydrogen from C6, forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the carbon with the bromine (C2) and displacing the bromide ion. This forms a bicyclic intermediate containing a three-membered ring (a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one, or a cyclopropanone fused to a five-membered ring).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n    4.  The bicyclic ring opens to relieve ring strain, leading to the formation of a more stable cyclopentane ring structure. Specifically, the bond between the original carbonyl carbon and the bromine-bearing carbon breaks, forming a carbanion which is then protonated during workup.\n*   **Product 2:** The final product of this rearrangement is a carboxylic acid with a five-membered ring. Thus, Product 2 is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n    *   *Alternative consideration:* An E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is also possible but is less likely. If this were the product, the next step (reaction with SOCl₂) would not proceed as described, making the Favorskii pathway the intended route.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid and thionyl chloride with pyridine.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The -OH group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a -Cl atom. Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(H)(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a reduction reaction. LiAl(H)(O-t-Bu)₃ is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to alcohols, which would occur with a stronger reducing agent like LiAlH₄.\n*   **Product 4:** The acyl chloride is reduced to an aldehyde. The product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. \"Chemically distinct\" refers to hydrogens that are non-equivalent and would give separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Assuming free rotation of the C-C bond between the ring and the aldehyde group, or considering the time-averaged conformation, the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon of the ring, and the hydrogen atom attached to C1. This plane bisects the ring, making C2 and C5 equivalent, and C3 and C4 equivalent.\n\nLet's count the distinct types of hydrogens:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-CHO):** This proton is unique in its chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (the methine proton):** This is the single hydrogen on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group. It is on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons (a CH₂ group). These two geminal protons are not equivalent to each other. They are **diastereotopic** because C1 is a prochiral center. Replacing one of them with another group (e.g., Deuterium) would create a diastereomer compared to replacing the other. Therefore, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similar to C2 and C5, these two carbons are equivalent by symmetry. The two geminal protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic due to their relationship with the substituent at C1. These four protons give rise to another two distinct signals. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5-H₂) + 2 (from C3/C4-H₂) = **6**\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
