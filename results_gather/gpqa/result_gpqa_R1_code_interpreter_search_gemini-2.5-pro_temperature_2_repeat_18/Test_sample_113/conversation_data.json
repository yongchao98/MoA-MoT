    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Reactants:** `butan-2-one` (a ketone), `NaCN` (a source of the nucleophile, cyanide ion CN⁻), and reagent `A`.\n    *   **Product:** `2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`. Let's verify the structure. Butan-2-one is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The reaction adds a -CN and a -H to the C=O double bond. The oxygen becomes -OH. The product is CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃. The IUPAC name for this structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which matches the product given.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic addition of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n        1.  `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃ + CN⁻ ⇌ CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃` (tetrahedral intermediate/alkoxide)\n        2.  `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃` (product)\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** The second step requires a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the intermediate alkoxide.\n    *   **Evaluating options for A:**\n        *   `H₃O⁺`: This is an excellent source of protons. The reaction is often catalyzed by acid. A common procedure involves adding an acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ to a mixture of the ketone and NaCN. The acid provides H₃O⁺, which catalyzes the reaction and provides the necessary proton for the final step. While adding strong acid directly to NaCN can produce dangerous HCN gas, it's a standard representation for the required acidic conditions.\n        *   `NaHSO₃`: Sodium bisulfite reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products (`R₂C(OH)SO₃Na`). This is a separate reaction and would compete with, rather than facilitate, the cyanohydrin formation. Thus, NaHSO₃ is not the correct reagent 'A'.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be `H₃O⁺`.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Reactants:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile` (a cyanohydrin), reagent `B`, and `H₂O`.\n    *   **Product:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`. This is the corresponding α-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The reaction replaces the -CN group with a -COOH group, which is a characteristic nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   **Conditions:** Nitrile hydrolysis is typically performed under strong acidic or strong basic conditions, usually with heating.\n        *   **Acidic Hydrolysis:** R-CN + 2 H₂O + H⁺ (catalyst) → R-COOH + NH₄⁺\n        *   **Basic Hydrolysis:** R-CN + OH⁻ (catalyst) + H₂O → R-COO⁻ + NH₃. An acid workup (H₃O⁺) is then needed to get the carboxylic acid R-COOH.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Since the product is the carboxylic acid directly (R-COOH) and not its salt (R-COO⁻), and water is a reactant, this points towards an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Reagent B is the acid catalyst.\n    *   **Evaluating options for B:**\n        *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid, commonly used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles. Its presence provides the necessary H₃O⁺ ions in water to drive the reaction.\n        *   `CH₃COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it can act as a proton source, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid in a reasonable timeframe. Strong mineral acids are required for this transformation.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B must be `HCl`.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the results:**\n    *   We determined that A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   We determined that B = HCl.\n    *   Matching these findings with the given options:\n        *   A) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl (Incorrect A)\n        *   B) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl (Correct A and B)\n        *   C) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect B)\n        *   D) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect A and B)\n\n4.  **Final Answer:** The correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
