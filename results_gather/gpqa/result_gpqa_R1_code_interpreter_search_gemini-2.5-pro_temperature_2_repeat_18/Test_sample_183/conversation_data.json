    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's identify the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring:\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\n    This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. Such substitution patterns are often challenging to synthesize due to competing directing effects of the substituents.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, Ortho, Para-director. It's bulky, so it often favors para substitution.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, Ortho, Para-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, Meta-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies:**\n    *   The **ethoxy group (-OEt)** is typically introduced by a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr` or similar reagents) on a corresponding phenol (-OH).\n    *   The **phenol group (-OH)** is often prepared from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) followed by hydrolysis (`H3O+/Heat`).\n    *   This suggests that a key intermediate is likely an aniline derivative: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. If we can synthesize this molecule, the sequence `aniline -> diazonium salt -> phenol -> ether` is straightforward. The options reflect this common transformation. For example, in option A, steps (v), (vi), and (vii) correspond to this transformation.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options Provided:**\n\n    Let's analyze each option to see if it can produce the necessary precursor and ultimately the final product in a logical, high-yield manner.\n\n    *   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n        Step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is for diazotization of an amino group. The product from step (iii) is a nitro-sulfonic acid, which does not have an amino group. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n        This sequence starts by making aniline (benzene -> nitrobenzene -> aniline). Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. Aniline's amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl3`), forming a strongly deactivating, meta-directing complex. This makes the reaction difficult and poorly selective. This is not a good synthetic route.\n\n    *   **Option B:** `...iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n        Step (vi) involves treating a diazonium salt (formed in step v) with a nitrating mixture (`HNO3/H2SO4`). This is not a standard or logical reaction for diazonium salts. They are typically replaced by groups like -H, -OH, -X, -CN, but not nitrated in this way. The sequence is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n        This sequence is the most complex but also the only chemically plausible one, despite apparent difficulties with regioselectivity. Let's trace a potential pathway:\n\n        1.  `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3` on benzene gives `tert-butylbenzene`.\n        2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4` gives a mixture of `o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` and `p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`. The ortho isomer is the minor product, but it's the one needed to achieve the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. The problem mentions \"high-yield\", which is a challenge here, but let's assume we proceed with the ortho isomer.\n        3.  `iii) Fe/HCl` reduces the nitro group to an amino group, yielding `o-tert-butylaniline`.\n        4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4` nitrates `o-tert-butylaniline`. Under strong acid, the aniline becomes anilinium (-NH3+), a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director. This will lead to a mixture of products, including the desired `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` and other isomers like `2-tert-butyl-5-nitroaniline`.\n        5.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`, `vi) H3O+/Heat`, `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: This sequence converts the amino group of the isomeric mixture into an ethoxy group. We now have a mixture containing our target product, `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`, and other isomers.\n        6.  `viii) SO3/H2SO4` (Sulfonation) and `ix) dilute H2SO4` (Desulfonation): These two steps at the end provide the solution to the mixture problem. Sulfonation is reversible. The different isomers will sulfonate at different rates and positions. The resulting sulfonic acids will have different physical properties (like solubility), allowing them to be separated (e.g., by fractional crystallization). Once the desired isomer's sulfonic acid is isolated, it is treated with dilute acid and steam (desulfonation) to remove the `-SO3H` group, yielding the pure final product.\n\n        While the yields of individual steps (especially nitrations) might not be perfect, this entire sequence is chemically logical and provides a method to isolate the desired product, which is something the other options fail to do. By elimination and detailed analysis, Option A presents a complete, albeit complex, synthetic route.\n\n<<<A>>>"
