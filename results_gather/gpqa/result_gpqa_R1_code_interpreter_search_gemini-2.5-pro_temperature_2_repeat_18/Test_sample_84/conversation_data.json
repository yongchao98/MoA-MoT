    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\nTo find the ratio for the two planets, we set up the equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and will cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so the $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ term also cancels out.\n\nThe formula simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis means we need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n### 4. Relating Doppler Shift to the Semi-Major Axis\nThe maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is used to find the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n$K = c \\times \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is therefore:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\times (\\Delta \\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0)}{c \\times (\\Delta \\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0)} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on its star is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis ($a$) by the formula:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star} + M_p}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n(Assuming a circular orbit where eccentricity e=0)\n\nSince both planets were detected via the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on to our line of sight, which means the inclination angle $i$ is approximately 90° for both. Thus, $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$.\nAlso, the masses of the planets ($7 M_{Earth}$ and $5 M_{Earth}$) are negligible compared to the star's mass ($1.5 M_{Sun}$), so $M_{star} + M_p \\approx M_{star}$.\n\nThe simplified formula becomes:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\nWe can now solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_{star}} \\frac{G}{a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\n### 5. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_2^2 / (K_2^2 M_{star})}{G M_1^2 / (K_1^2 M_{star})}$\nThe constants $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 / K_2^2}{M_1^2 / K_1^2} = (\\frac{M_2}{M_1})^2 \\times (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^2$\n\n### 6. Final Calculation\nNow, substitute this result back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{M_2}{M_1})^2 \\times (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^2} = (\\frac{M_2}{M_1}) \\times (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})$\n\nWe have the ratios for mass and velocity amplitude:\n*   $\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nTo find the numerical value, we perform the division:\n$15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option A.\n\n```python\n# A simple calculation to confirm the result.\n# Ratio of masses (M2/M1)\nmass_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Ratio of RV semi-amplitudes (K1/K2) is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts\ndoppler_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T1/T2 is (M2/M1) * (K1/K2)\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * doppler_ratio\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it receives from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula for the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo (the fraction of incident light that is reflected).\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), most of the terms cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes. We need to find this ratio using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method.\n\nThe maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is related to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) by:\n$K = c \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light. The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is therefore:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is given by:\n$K = \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star} + M_p}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\nSince the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits are nearly edge-on, so we can assume $i \\approx 90°$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$. Also, the planet masses ($5-7 M_{Earth}$) are negligible compared to the star's mass ($1.5 M_{Sun}$), so $M_{star} + M_p \\approx M_{star}$.\nThe simplified formula becomes:\n$K \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}} \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\sqrt{G} \\frac{M_p}{K\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_2^2 / (K_2^2 M_{star})}{G M_1^2 / (K_1^2 M_{star})} = (\\frac{M_2}{M_1})^2 \\times (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^2$\n\nFinally, we substitute this back into our temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{M_2}{M_1})^2 \\times (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^2} = \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\times \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\nWe have the following ratios:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5 M_{Earth}}{7 M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Velocity amplitude ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, we calculate the final temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nLet's compute the numerical value.\n```python\nM2_over_M1 = 5 / 7\nK1_over_K2 = 0.03 / 0.04\nT_ratio = M2_over_M1 * K1_over_K2\nprint(T_ratio)\n```",
