    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water. The dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2.\n\n*   Initial Molarity (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final Molarity (M2) = ?\n\nM2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Moles of Acetic Acid**\n\nNext, we calculate the initial number of moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.\n\n*   Moles = Molarity × Volume (in L)\n*   Volume = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L * 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n\n**Step 3: Calculate pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted. This creates a buffer solution.\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n*   [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nThe pKa is calculated from the given Ka:\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n\nThe ratio of [A⁻]/[HA] at 25% titration is the ratio of their moles, which is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n\npH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)\npH = 4.7328 - 0.4771\npH = 4.2557\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nThe equivalence point is reached when all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now contains only sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), the conjugate base of acetic acid.\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak base:\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nTo find the pH, we first need to find the pOH by calculating the concentration of OH⁻ produced.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH added to reach equivalence:**\n    Moles of NaOH = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Total volume at equivalence:**\n    V_total = V_acid_diluted + V_NaOH_added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]) at equivalence:**\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / V_total = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   **Calculate Kb for acetate:**\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻] using the Kb expression:**\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) = 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) = 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nI will use Python to verify these calculations.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1e-14\n\n# Initial acid properties\nM_acid_initial = 0.05\nV_acid_initial = 0.020 # in Liters\n\n# Dilution\nV_water_added = 0.020 # in Liters\nV_acid_diluted = V_acid_initial + V_water_added\nM_acid_diluted = (M_acid_initial * V_acid_initial) / V_acid_diluted\n\n# Titrant properties\nM_NaOH = 0.1\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% titration ---\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] ratio is 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at equivalence point ---\n# Moles of acid to be titrated\nmoles_acid = M_acid_diluted * V_acid_diluted\n\n# Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence\nV_NaOH_eq = moles_acid / M_NaOH\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nV_total_eq = V_acid_diluted + V_NaOH_eq\n\n# Concentration of conjugate base (A-) at equivalence\nM_A_minus_eq = moles_acid / V_total_eq\n\n# Kb of the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# [OH-] concentration from hydrolysis: Kb = x^2 / (M_A_minus - x)\n# Using the quadratic formula to solve for x = [OH-]\n# x = (-Kb + sqrt(Kb^2 - 4*1*(-Kb*M_A_minus))) / 2\na = 1\nb = Kb\nc = -Kb * M_A_minus_eq\nOH_concentration = (-b + math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)\n\n# pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculations are as follows:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid.**\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume after dilution (V2) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2:\n    M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n    So, the concentration of the acetic acid to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has reacted to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), and 75% remains. This is a buffer solution, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   First, calculate the pKa from Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of their moles, which is 25%/75% = 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO). The solution contains only CH₃COO⁻, which hydrolyzes in water as a weak base:\nCH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\n*   **Moles of acid:**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume (L) = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol of CH₃COOH\n*   **Volume of NaOH required:**\n    At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume at equivalence:**\n    Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([A⁻]):**\n    [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Calculate Kb for acetate:**\n    Kw = Ka * Kb => Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻] from hydrolysis:**\n    Use the equilibrium expression for the base hydrolysis: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / (0.02)\n    x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n    The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
