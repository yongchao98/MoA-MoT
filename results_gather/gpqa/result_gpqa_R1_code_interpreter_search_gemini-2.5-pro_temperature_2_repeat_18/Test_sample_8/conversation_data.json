    "*   **Analysis of the Symmetry of Each Molecule**\n\nTo determine which molecule has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule and determine its point group. The C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a C3 principal axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis. It lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and any vertical mirror planes (σv).\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (A)**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other. Three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges connect the two bridgeheads.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   It has a **C3 axis** that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon. A 120° rotation around this axis maps each ethylene bridge onto the next.\n        *   It has three **vertical mirror planes (σv)**. Each plane contains the C3 axis and bisects one of the ethylene bridges.\n        *   It **lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh)** perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group:** The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes but no σh plane means its point group is **C3v**.\n\n2.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (B)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a large, planar aromatic core called triphenylene, to which three anhydride-like groups are fused. The triphenylene core itself is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   The molecule is planar, so it possesses a **σh mirror plane**, which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n        *   It has a **C3 axis** perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n        *   Crucially, it also possesses three **C2 axes** lying within the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group:** A molecule with a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane belongs to the **D3h** point group. While D3h contains all the symmetry elements of C3h (a C3 axis and a σh plane), its overall symmetry is higher. Usually, such questions ask for the full point group of the molecule.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to its alternating sides (1,2-, 3,4-, and 5,6- positions).\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   The molecule is planar, so it has a **σh mirror plane** (the molecular plane).\n        *   It has a **C3 axis** perpendicular to the plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   It **lacks C2 axes** perpendicular to the C3 axis. A 180° rotation around an axis in the plane would not leave the molecule unchanged due to the arrangement of the anhydride groups (specifically the oxygen atoms).\n        *   It also **lacks vertical mirror planes (σv)**.\n    *   **Point Group:** The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane, with the absence of perpendicular C2 axes and σv planes, uniquely defines the **C3h** point group.\n\n4.  **Triisopropyl borate (D)**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B and three O atoms are nearly coplanar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   Due to the steric bulk of the three isopropyl groups, they arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion. This conformation gives the molecule a **C3 axis** passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n        *   However, it **lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh)**. The hydrogen atoms on the central carbon of each isopropyl group and the methyl groups are not in the B(O)3 plane, and reflecting them across this plane does not result in an identical structure.\n    *   **Point Group:** In its most stable conformation, the point group is **C3**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\nComparing the point groups of the four molecules:\n*   A) Quinuclidine: **C3v**\n*   B) Triphenyleno[...]...: **D3h**\n*   C) Benzo[...]...: **C3h**\n*   D) Triisopropyl borate: **C3**\n\nThe only molecule whose point group is C3h is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
