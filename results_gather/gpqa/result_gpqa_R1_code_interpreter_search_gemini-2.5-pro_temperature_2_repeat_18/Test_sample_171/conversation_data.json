    "This problem requires us to use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. Understand the Boltzmann Equation:**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (`N_j`) to the number of atoms in a lower state (`N_i`) is given by:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in the excited and lower states, respectively.\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two energy levels. These are intrinsic properties of the atomic energy levels.\n*   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the two levels, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Translate the Problem into an Equation:**\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population of that specific excited state to a reference state (like the ground state) is twice as large in star_1 as it is in star_2.\n\nLet `R` be this ratio of populations (e.g., `N_excited / N_ground`). We can write the problem statement as:\nR_1 = 2 * R_2\n\nNow, let's substitute the Boltzmann equation for each star:\n*   For star 1 (temperature T_1):  R_1 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n*   For star 2 (temperature T_2):  R_2 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nPlugging these into our relationship `R_1 = 2 * R_2`:\n\n(g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n**3. Solve the Equation:**\n\nThe statistical weight ratio `(g_excited / g_ground)` is the same for the iron atom regardless of the star, so it cancels out from both sides:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(exp(x)) = x):\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\nFactor out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nFind a common denominator for the term in the parenthesis:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n**4. Substitute the Given Numerical Values:**\n\nThe problem provides:\n*   Energy difference, ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n*   The Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\nLet's compute the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nNow substitute this value back into our derived equation:\n\nln(2) = (1) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
