    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\":** This indicates a benzene ring with two groups attached. The general formula is C₆H₄XY.\n*   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\":** The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... carbonyl group\":** This confirms the presence of a C=O double bond in one of the substituents.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... aromatic-halogen bond\":** This confirms that one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. Let's call this substituent -X.\n\n**2. Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n\n*   We have one halogen substituent, -X.\n*   The second substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable substituent fitting this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   Let's check the carbon count: C₆ (ring) + C₂ (acetyl group) = C₈. This matches the total carbon count.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**.\n\n*Alternative Structure Check:* Another possibility for the C₂ + carbonyl substituent could be -CH₂CHO. This would make the molecule a halophenylacetaldehyde. We will keep this in mind as we analyze the NMR data.\n\n**3. Analyze the Substitution Pattern based on NMR Data:**\n\nLet's examine the aromatic region of the NMR spectra provided in the options.\n\n*   Options A and D both show a pattern of `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern, consisting of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para isomer makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent to each other, and the same for the two protons on the other side. This results in the simple \"doublet of doublets\" pattern.\n*   Ortho (1,2) or meta (1,3) substitution would lead to more complex spectra with four distinct signals in the aromatic region, which is not observed in options A or D.\n*   Options B and C can be eliminated. Option B shows no aromatic protons. Option C's aromatic region (`6.9 (1H, s)`) is inconsistent with a disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nSo, the compound must be a **p-haloacetophenone** or a **p-halophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**4. Differentiate Between the Two Possible Structures using Full NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Structure 1: p-haloacetophenone** (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** Two doublets, 4H total. (Matches A & D)\n    *   **Acetyl group protons (-COCH₃):** A methyl group next to a carbonyl with no adjacent protons. This should appear as a **singlet integrating to 3H**, typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n*   **Structure 2: p-halophenylacetaldehyde** (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** Two doublets, 4H total. (Matches A & D)\n    *   **Aldehyde proton (-CHO):** Very deshielded, typically 9-10 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CH₂- group, so it should be a **triplet**.\n    *   **Methylene protons (-CH₂-):** Benzylic and adjacent to a carbonyl, typically 3.5-4.0 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CHO proton, so it should be a **doublet**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Final Options (A and D):**\n\n*   **Option D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the expectation for **p-haloacetophenone**.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: The para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: The singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group. The chemical shift, integration, and splitting are all correct.\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum attempts to describe p-halophenylacetaldehyde due to the aldehyde peak at 9.9 ppm.\n    *   However, there is a critical error in the splitting pattern. The aldehyde proton at 9.9 ppm and the methylene protons at 3.7 ppm should be a triplet and a doublet, respectively, due to mutual coupling. They are incorrectly listed as **singlets (s)**.\n    *   Furthermore, the aromatic signals at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are more deshielded than what would be expected for a ring attached to a -CH₂CHO group; they are more consistent with the strong electron-withdrawing effect of a directly attached acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in Option D is a perfect match for p-haloacetophenone, which fulfills all the criteria described in the question. The data in Option A contains significant inconsistencies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
