    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Concepts**\n\n*   **Relativistic Velocity Addition/Subtraction:** When dealing with speeds close to the speed of light (c), we cannot simply add or subtract velocities. We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. For two objects moving in the same direction, the relative speed (v_rel) between them is given by:\n    v_rel = |v1 - v2| / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy (E) of a moving particle is not just its kinetic energy but includes its rest energy. It is given by the formula:\n    E = γmc^2\n    where:\n    *   m is the rest mass of the particle.\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n*   **Total Energy of a System:** The total energy of a system of non-interacting particles is the sum of the total energies of the individual particles.\n    E_total = E1 + E2 + ...\n\n**2. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut (v1) = 0.6c\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut (v2) = 0.5c\n*   Both are moving in the same direction.\n\nUsing the relativistic velocity subtraction formula:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E)**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the individual energy of each astronaut and then add them together.\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass (m1) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v1) = 0.6c\n\nCalculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\nγ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1^2/c^2)\nγ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\nγ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nγ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)\nγ1 = 1 / 0.8\nγ1 = 1.25\n\nCalculate the energy (E1):\nE1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2\nE1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2\nE1 = 2.5 mc^2\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass (m2) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v2) = 0.5c\n\nCalculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\nγ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v2^2/c^2)\nγ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2)\nγ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)\nγ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)\nγ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866\nγ2 ≈ 1.1547\n\nCalculate the energy (E2):\nE2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2\nE2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2\nE2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2\n\n**Total Energy (E_total):**\nE_total = E1 + E2\nE_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2\nE_total = 5.964 mc^2\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc^2**.\n\n**4. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   Relative speed: v_rel ≈ 0.14c\n*   Total energy: E ≈ 5.96 mc^2\n\nThese results match option B.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nc = 1  # Speed of light can be set to 1 for easier calculation\n\n# Given values\nm = 1 # We can use a reference mass of 1, the final answer will be in terms of mc^2\nm1 = 2 * m\nm2 = 3 * m\nv1 = 0.6 * c\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Part 1: Calculate Relative Speed ---\n# Formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/c^2)\nv_rel_numerator = v1 - v2\nv_rel_denominator = 1 - (v1 * v2) / (c**2)\nv_rel = v_rel_numerator / v_rel_denominator\n\n# --- Part 2: Calculate Total Energy ---\n# Formula: E = gamma * m * c^2, where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\n# Astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1**2 / c**2))\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * (c**2)\n\n# Astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2**2 / c**2))\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * (c**2)\n\n# Total Energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\n# Print the results, formatted to match the options\nprint(f\"Relative speed (v_rel): {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"Total energy (E_total): {E_total:.2f} mc^2\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The problem asks for two quantities: the relative speed (`v_rel`) between two astronauts and the total energy (`E`) of the system, given their masses and relativistic speeds.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Relative Speed:** Since the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light (`c`), we cannot use classical velocity subtraction (`v_rel = v1 - v2`). We must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula (a form of the Lorentz velocity transformation). For two objects moving in the same direction, the formula is:\n        `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n    *   **Total Energy:** The energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is not its classical kinetic energy. It is its total relativistic energy, which includes both rest energy and kinetic energy. The formula is:\n        `E = γ * m_rest * c^2`\n        where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`\n    *   **System Energy:** The total energy of the system is simply the sum of the total energies of the individual non-interacting astronauts:\n        `E_total = E1 + E2`\n\n3.  **Plan the Calculation:**\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the relative speed `v_rel`.**\n        *   Substitute `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c` into the relativistic velocity subtraction formula.\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the total energy `E_total`.**\n        *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ1` for astronaut 1 (`v1 = 0.6c`).\n        *   Then, calculate the energy `E1` for astronaut 1 (`m1 = 2m`).\n        *   Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ2` for astronaut 2 (`v2 = 0.5c`).\n        *   Then, calculate the energy `E2` for astronaut 2 (`m2 = 3m`).\n        *   Finally, add `E1` and `E2` to get `E_total`.\n    *   **Step 3: Compare the results with the given options.**\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation (using a Python script for precision):**\n    I will write a Python script to perform these calculations to avoid rounding errors and to verify the steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Description of the calculation steps for the script.\n# Part 1: Calculate the relative speed (v_rel) using the relativistic velocity addition/subtraction formula.\n# v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n# Part 2: Calculate the total energy of the system (E_total).\n# E_total = E1 + E2\n# E_i = gamma_i * m_i * c^2\n# gamma_i = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_i^2 / c^2)\n\n# Set c=1 for simplicity, as velocities are given in terms of c.\nc = 1.0\n\n# Given values for astronaut 1\nm1_factor = 2.0  # mass is 2m\nv1 = 0.6 * c\n\n# Given values for astronaut 2\nm2_factor = 3.0  # mass is 3m\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate Relative Speed ---\nv_rel_numerator = v1 - v2\nv_rel_denominator = 1 - (v1 * v2) / (c**2)\nv_rel = v_rel_numerator / v_rel_denominator\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate Total Energy ---\n# Astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1**2 / c**2))\n# E1 is expressed in units of mc^2\nE1_factor = gamma1 * m1_factor\n\n# Astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2**2 / c**2))\n# E2 is expressed in units of mc^2\nE2_factor = gamma2 * m2_factor\n\n# Total Energy\nE_total_factor = E1_factor + E2_factor\n\n# Print the results in the format of the options\nprint(f\"v_rel = {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"E = {E_total_factor:.2f} mc^2\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
