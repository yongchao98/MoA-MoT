    "This question asks us to compare the densities of four different exoplanets. Density is defined as mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the planet's radius.\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n**a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\nThis planet is essentially identical to Earth. We'll use it as our baseline. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's denote this as ρ_E.\n*   Mass = M_E\n*   Radius = R_E\n*   Density = ρ_a = ρ_E ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n\n**b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.**\nThis planet's density is given directly.\n*   Mass = 2 M_E\n*   Density = ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\nThis density is nearly identical to Earth's density.\n\n**c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\nThis is the most interesting case. The planet has the same raw materials as Earth (e.g., iron, silicates) but is much more massive.\n*   Mass = M_c = 5 M_E\n*   Composition = Same as Earth.\nA fundamental principle of planetary structure is that as the mass of a planet increases, its own gravitational force becomes stronger. This stronger gravity compresses the material inside the planet more tightly. For a planet with the same composition as a smaller one, this increased compression results in a higher overall density.\nTherefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with the same composition as Earth must be denser than Earth.\n*   Density = ρ_c > ρ_E ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n\n**d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\nThis is the opposite of case (c). This planet is less massive than Earth.\n*   Mass = M_d = 0.5 M_E\n*   Composition = Same as Earth.\nWith less mass, the force of gravity is weaker, and the planet's material is less compressed. Therefore, its average density will be lower than Earth's.\n*   Density = ρ_d < ρ_E ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNow let's compare the densities:\n*   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   ρ_b ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n*   ρ_c > 5.51 g/cm³\n*   ρ_d < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nComparing these values, the planet in option (c) clearly has the highest density. The physical principle is that for planets of the same composition, density increases with mass due to gravitational self-compression.\n\n<<<B>>>"
