    "To determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein produced by the gene. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a non-functional protein. This is typically achieved through a nonsense mutation (creating a premature stop codon) or a frameshift mutation (inserting or deleting nucleotides in a number not divisible by three).\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    The gene starts with `5’-ATG...`, which is the start codon for Methionine (Met). The translation process will read the sequence in groups of three (codons) from this point.\n    *   Intact Gene: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... TGA-3’`\n    *   Translating the first few codons:\n        *   `ATG`: Methionine (Met)\n        *   `TTT`: Phenylalanine (Phe)\n        *   `CTC`: Leucine (Leu)\n        *   `GCT`: Alanine (Ala)\n        *   `GGT`: Glycine (Gly)\n    *   Intact Protein start: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...\n\n2.  **Analyze Mutant 1:**\n    *   Intact Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCT...`\n    *   Mutant 1 Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCT...`\n    *   Let's align them and identify the changes in codons:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC ...`\n        *   Mutant: `ATG TTC TAC ...`\n    *   The second codon `TTT` changes to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` changes to `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid. While a missense mutation *can* disrupt protein function, it's not the most probable way to completely eliminate it. The protein might just have reduced activity or altered properties.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mutant 2:**\n    *   Intact Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCT...`\n    *   Mutant 2 Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT...`\n    *   Let's align the codons:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC ...`\n        *   Mutant: `ATG TTC TAA ...`\n    *   The second codon `TTT` changes to `TTC` (a silent mutation, Phe -> Phe).\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause the ribosome to stop translation after the second amino acid. The resulting protein will only be two amino acids long (Met-Phe). Such a severely truncated protein is almost certain to be non-functional, thus eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mutant 3:**\n    *   Intact Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...`\n    *   Mutant 3 Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...`\n    *   Comparing the sequences, we see an insertion.\n        *   Intact: `ATGTTT - CTCGCT...`\n        *   Mutant: `ATGTTT T ACGCT...`\n    *   A single nucleotide (`T`) has been inserted after the second codon (`TTT`). This is a **frameshift mutation**.\n    *   The original reading frame was: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ...`\n    *   The new reading frame is: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT ...` wait, let's re-read carefully. The `T` is inserted *after* `TTT`.\n        * New frame: `ATG TTT TCT CGC TGG T...`\n    *   This insertion changes the reading frame for all subsequent codons. The entire amino acid sequence after Phenylalanine will be incorrect, and it is very likely that a random stop codon will be encountered shortly downstream, leading to a truncated and garbled protein. This, like a nonsense mutation, is a highly probable way to inactivate the gene.\n\n5.  **Analyze Mutant 4:**\n    *   Intact Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...`\n    *   Mutant 4 Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...`\n    *   Aligning the sequences reveals a more complex change. The most likely event here is the deletion of three nucleotides `GGT` from a position slightly downstream of a point mutation.\n        *   Intact codons: `... GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   If `GGT` is deleted, the sequence becomes: `... GCT ACT ...`\n    *   This is an **in-frame deletion** (deleting a full codon). The result is the loss of a single amino acid (Glycine) from the protein chain. Like a missense mutation, deleting one amino acid might disrupt the protein, but it is less likely to completely eliminate function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth Mutant 2 (nonsense mutation) and Mutant 3 (frameshift mutation) are highly likely to create a non-functional protein. Both are considered \"knockout\" mutations. However, a nonsense mutation that introduces a STOP codon very early in the sequence, as in Mutant 2, provides the most direct and certain path to a severely truncated, non-functional product. It terminates the process definitively at that point. Therefore, Mutant 2 represents the most probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
