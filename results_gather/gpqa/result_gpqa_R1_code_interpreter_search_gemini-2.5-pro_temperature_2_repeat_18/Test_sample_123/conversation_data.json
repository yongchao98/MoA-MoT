    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and radioactive decay.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics:**\n\n*   **Radioactive Decay:** The number of particles, `N`, that have not decayed after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `T` is the mean lifetime of the particles *in the frame of reference where `t` is measured*.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The particles are moving at relativistic speeds. Their internal \"clock\" runs slower than a stationary clock in the lab. The mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, `τ`) is related to the lifetime measured in the lab frame (`T`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`): `T = γ * τ`.\n\n**2. Set up the Equations:**\n\n*   The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center of the detector to its inner wall (a distance `L` = 30 m) in the lab frame is `t_lab`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n    `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`\n*   The number of particles that reach the detector wall without decaying is given by:\n    `N = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / T)`\n*   Substituting `T = γ * τ` and `t_lab = L / c`, we get:\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-(L / c) / (γ * τ))`\n    The term `(L / c) / τ` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call it `C`. So, `C = (L/c)/τ`.\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-C / γ)`\n\n**3. Apply the Given Information (Case 1):**\n\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁` = 20.\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `N₁ / N₀` = 1/3.\n*   Plugging these into our simplified equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-C / 20)`\n*   To solve for `C`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -C / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -C / 20`\n    `C = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**4. Solve for the Unknown (Case 2):**\n\n*   We want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the fraction of particles reaching the detector is `N₂ / N₀` = 2/3.\n*   Using our equation again:\n    `2/3 = exp(-C / γ₂)`\n*   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -C / γ₂`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -C / γ₂`\n    `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -C / γ₂`\n    `γ₂ = C / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n*   Now, substitute the value of `C` we found in Step 3:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Value:**\n\nWe can now compute the numerical value for `γ₂`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given Lorentz factor for the first case\ngamma1 = 20\n\n# Calculate ln(3) and ln(1.5)\nln_3 = math.log(3)\nln_1_5 = math.log(1.5)\n\n# Calculate the new Lorentz factor, gamma2\ngamma2 = gamma1 * (ln_3 / ln_1_5)\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields approximately `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the core physics principles:** The problem involves two key concepts from modern physics:\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving particle's internal clock runs slower than a stationary observer's clock. The lifetime of a fast-moving particle as measured in the lab frame (`T_lab`) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, `τ`) by a factor of `γ` (the Lorentz factor). The formula is `T_lab = γ * τ`.\n    *   **Radioactive Decay:** The number of particles (`N`) that have not decayed after a time `t` follows an exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `T` is the mean lifetime in the frame where `t` is measured.\n\n2.  **Set up the governing equation:**\n    *   Let `L` be the radius of the detector (30 m).\n    *   The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the wall, as measured in the lab frame, is `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`.\n    *   In the lab frame, the mean lifetime of these particles is `T_lab = γ * τ`.\n    *   The fraction of particles (`N/N₀`) that reach the wall without decaying is given by the decay formula, using the time and lifetime measured in the lab frame:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / T_lab)`\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `T_lab`:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-(L/c) / (γ * τ))`\n    *   The term `(L/c) / τ` is a constant for this specific type of particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `k`. So, the relationship is:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n3.  **Use the first set of data to find the constant `k`:**\n    *   Given: When `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of particles reaching the wall is `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`.\n    *   Plug these values into our equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n    *   To solve for `k`, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n        `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n4.  **Use the constant `k` to find the required Lorentz factor for the second case:**\n    *   Required: Find `γ₂` when the fraction of particles reaching the wall is `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`.\n    *   Plug these values and the expression for `k` into our equation:\n        `2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n    *   Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n        `ln(2) - ln(3) = -k / γ₂`\n        `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -k / γ₂`\n        `γ₂ = k / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n    *   Now substitute the expression for `k` we found earlier:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can simplify the denominator:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    *   We can compute this value to find the answer.\n    *   Using a calculator: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\n6.  **Compare with the options:**\n    *   The calculated value `γ₂ ≈ 54.19` is extremely close to option D.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe problem describes particles decaying as they travel from the center of a detector to its walls. The fraction of particles that survive the journey depends on the time it takes to travel and their lifetime. Due to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime of the particles as observed in the lab is stretched by the Lorentz factor, γ.\n\nThe fraction of surviving particles `(N/N₀)` is given by the formula:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(travel time in lab) / (lifetime in lab))`\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(L/c) / (γ*τ))`\nwhere `L` is the detector radius, `c` is the speed of light, `γ` is the Lorentz factor, and `τ` is the particle's proper lifetime.\n\n**Case 1:**\nGiven `γ₁ = 20` and `N/N₀ = 1/3`.\n`1/3 = exp(- (L/cτ) / 20)`\nTaking the natural log: `ln(1/3) = -ln(3) = -(L/cτ) / 20`.\nSo, the constant term `(L/cτ) = 20 * ln(3)`.\n\n**Case 2:**\nWe need to find `γ₂` such that `N/N₀ = 2/3`.\n`2/3 = exp(- (L/cτ) / γ₂)`\nTaking the natural log: `ln(2/3) = -(L/cτ) / γ₂`.\n`ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3)`.\nSo, `γ₂ = (L/cτ) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`.\n\nNow, we substitute the value for `(L/cτ)` from Case 1:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n`γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is closest to 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
