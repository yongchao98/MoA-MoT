    "Here is my reasoning and thinking process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This strongly implies a benzene ring with two substituents (C6H4). The \"di-substituted\" nature means there are 4 protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **FTIR Data:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-). This tells us the molecule contains at least one C=O bond and an ether-like linkage. An ester group contributes C and O2 to the formula.\n    *   **1H NMR Data:** There are a total of six signals. Let's break them down:\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A benzene ring with two substituents has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a para- (1,4) substitution, which makes the protons chemically equivalent in two pairs.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to a C=C double bond. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to a group that does not cause further major splitting (like an aromatic ring).\n            *   Let's label the protons: Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   The signal for H(a) is split by H(b) into a **doublet**.\n            *   The signal for H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and this doublet is further split by the three protons of the adjacent -CH3 group into a quartet. The resulting signal is a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH3 fragment.\n        *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:** There are two chemically different methyl groups in the molecule. One is from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The other must be part of the second substituent.\n        *   **No signals for -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates many possible structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   One substituent is a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). Its formula is C3H5.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH3). To form a stable substituent containing these pieces without a -CH2- group, there are two common possibilities:\n        *   **Possibility A:** The substituent is a methyl ester group, -COOCH3. The benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n        *   **Possibility B:** The substituent is an acetoxy group, -O-CO-CH3. The benzene ring is attached to the oxygen atom.\n\n3.  **Construct the full structure and determine the molecular formula:**\n\n    *   **Based on Possibility A:** The molecule is methyl 4-(1-propenyl)benzoate.\n        *   Structure: CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3\n        *   Let's count the atoms:\n            *   Carbon (C): 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = 11\n            *   Hydrogen (H): 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = 12\n            *   Oxygen (O): 2 (from the ester)\n        *   The molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n    *   **Based on Possibility B:** The molecule is 4-(1-propenyl)phenyl acetate.\n        *   Structure: CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3\n        *   Let's count the atoms:\n            *   Carbon (C): 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from acetate) = 11\n            *   Hydrogen (H): 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from acetate) = 12\n            *   Oxygen (O): 2 (from the ester)\n        *   The molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n    Both plausible structures that fit all the spectroscopic data lead to the same molecular formula: C11H12O2.\n\n4.  **Verify the result by checking the other options:**\n\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - H/2.\n    *   **For C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This is consistent with a benzene ring (DoU=4), one C=C bond (DoU=1), and one C=O bond (DoU=1). (4+1+1 = 6). This fits our proposed structure perfectly.\n    *   **For C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. This DoU implies there is no C=C bond if a benzene ring and an ester group are present, which contradicts the NMR data showing vinyl protons. So, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **For C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. This DoU would require an additional ring or double bond compared to the features identified from the spectra. It's not possible to create a structure with this formula that matches all the NMR data. So, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **For C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. The DoU is consistent. However, if we try to build a molecule with this formula using the fragments identified (-CH=CH-CH3, C6H4, -COO-, a second -CH3), we find that a -CH2- group must be present, which contradicts the \"no –CH2 groups\" information from the NMR. So, this option is also incorrect.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis of the provided spectral data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
