    "*   **Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid's carbonyl group.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) stretching vibration.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond (an alkene). Vinyl-hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very strong indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the loss of the carboxyl group as a cation, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45.\n\n*   **Integrating the Data:**\n    *   All three techniques point to the same conclusion: the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid (it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C double bond).\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options B) C6H10O and C) C6H12O.\n    *   We are left with A) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n\n*   **Using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    *   From the spectroscopic data, we know the molecule has at least one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This requires a minimum DoU of 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 is not sufficient to account for both a C=O and a C=C bond. A compound with this formula would be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which lacks the C=C bond indicated by the FTIR and NMR data.\n        *   **For D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 is perfectly consistent with the presence of one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data conclusively shows the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. Only the formula C6H10O2 has the correct number of oxygen atoms and the required degree of unsaturation (2) to accommodate both a carboxylic acid functional group and an alkene functional group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
