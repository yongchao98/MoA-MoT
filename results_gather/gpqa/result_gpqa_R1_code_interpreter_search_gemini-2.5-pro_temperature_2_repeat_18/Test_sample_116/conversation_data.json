    "An organic compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is considered chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of axial chirality (as seen in some biphenyls and allenes). A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single bond.\n    *   Rotation around the single bond between the two phenyl rings can be restricted if there are bulky groups in the *ortho* positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   In this molecule, all four *ortho* positions are substituted: two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   These bulky groups prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted conformation.\n    *   Because the substitution pattern on each ring is not symmetric with respect to the other ring (e.g., the substituents at 2 and 6 are different), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   This condition leads to a form of chirality called atropisomerism, where two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations (enantiomers) exist.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. It is an ester of lactic acid.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon atom bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon).\n    *   Molecules containing a single chiral center are always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It is a symmetric ketone.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The two phenyl rings are identical.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Achiral molecules are optically inactive.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n    *   The presence of the double bond makes the core of the molecule planar.\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the C=C bond and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism.\nCompounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\nThus, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
