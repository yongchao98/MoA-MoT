    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the potential energy of the system.\n\n1.  **Identify the physical system:** The system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, with `d > R`. Being \"grounded\" means the sphere is held at a constant potential, which we take to be `V = 0`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem is elegantly solved using the method of images. The effect of the induced charges on the surface of the grounded conducting sphere can be perfectly replicated (for the region outside the sphere) by placing a single \"image charge,\" `q'`, at a specific location inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (`r=R`) becomes zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is on the z-axis at `z=d`. By symmetry, the image charge `q'` must also lie on the z-axis at some position `z=b`, where `b < R`.\n    *   The total potential `V(P)` at any point P on the surface of the sphere is the sum of the potentials from the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. This potential must be zero.\n    *   Standard derivation shows that to satisfy `V=0` for all points on the sphere `r=R`, the image charge must be:\n        *   Value: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   Position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work required to assemble it. A key insight here is how to correctly calculate this energy using the image charge model.\n\n    The total potential energy of a configuration of charges and conductors is given by `U = (1/2) Î£ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n\n    In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere.\n    *   The charge `q` is at a potential `V_q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n    *   The sphere itself has an induced charge `q_induced = q'`, but its potential `V_sphere` is held at 0.\n\n    So, the total energy equation simplifies to:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced_at_q + (1/2) * q_induced * V_sphere`\n    Since `V_sphere = 0`, the second term is zero.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced_at_q`\n\n    Now, we use the image charge to find `V_induced_at_q`. The potential at the location of `q` (at `z=d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` (at `z=b`).\n\n    The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    The potential at `z=d` due to `q'` is:\n    `V_induced_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    Substitute the values for `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_induced_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n\n    Simplify the denominator:\n    `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    So the potential is:\n    `V_induced_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d) = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Finally, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced_at_q = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    **Note:** This energy is half the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. The factor of 1/2 arises because the potential of the conductor is fixed at zero; its energy does not change as the induced charge gathers on it.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived formula is `U = - (1/2) * k*q^2*R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    This matches option (C).\n\n    *   A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (R^2 instead of R)\n    *   B) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect (d instead of R, and d^2+R^2)\n    *   C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\n    *   D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (missing 1/2, d instead of R)\n\n<<<C>>>"
