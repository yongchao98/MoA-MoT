    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial two-nucleon system is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws**\n\nThe initial system decays into a final two-nucleon state (`NN_f`) and a particle `X`.\n`NN_i -> NN_f + X`\n\nThe properties of the final state are:\n*   Final NN state: Quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`. Its parity is `P_f = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n*   Particle X: Intrinsic parity `P_X_intrinsic = -1`. Orbital angular momentum `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3...).\n\nWe must apply three main rules: Pauli Statistics (as given), Parity Conservation, and Angular Momentum Conservation.\n\n**Rule 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nIt is also given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\nSubstituting `T_f = 0` into the rule:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis equation means that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number. Consequently, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n*   **Condition 1: `S_f + L_f` must be odd.**\n\n**Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\nThe total parity of the system must be conserved.\n`P_initial = P_final`\n`P(NN_i) = P(NN_f) * P(X_orbital) * P(X_intrinsic)`\n`(+1) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1)^{l_X} * (-1)`\nMultiplying both sides by -1:\n`-1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`\nThis implies that the exponent `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n*   **Condition 2: `L_f + l_X` must be odd.**\n\n**Rule 3: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe total angular momentum `J` must be conserved.\n`J_i = J_{final_total}`\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\nThe final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's total angular momentum (`j_X`).\n`\\vec{J}_{final_total} = \\vec{J}_f + \\vec{j}_X`\nSo, `0 = \\vec{J}_f + \\vec{j}_X}`, which means `J_f = j_X`.\nThe particle X has orbital angular momentum `l_X` and intrinsic spin `s_X`. Its total angular momentum `j_X` can take values `|l_X - s_X|, ..., l_X + s_X`. The spin `s_X` is unknown, but a valid transition requires that there exists *some* possible value of `s_X` that satisfies `J_f = j_X`. A simple case is to check if the condition holds for a spinless particle (`s_X=0`), where `j_X = l_X`.\n*   **Condition 3: It must be possible that `J_f = j_X` (where `j_X` depends on `l_X` and `s_X`).**\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nWe will now test each option against these three conditions. The option that violates any of these conditions is not permitted.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1 = 7` -> `S_f=3`. `L=D` -> `L_f=2`. `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\nA two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. The maximum possible total spin is `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1`. A state with `S_f = 3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is forbidden.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. If X is spinless (`s_X=0`), `j_X = l_X = 1`. So `J_f=j_X` holds. OK.\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=3`, `l_X=3`. If X is spinless (`s_X=0`), `j_X = l_X = 3`. So `J_f=j_X` holds. OK.\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). This violates Condition 1, which requires `S_f + L_f` to be odd.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=0`, `l_X=0`. Requires `j_X = 0`. Since `j_X = |l_X-s_X| ... |l_X+s_X|`, with `l_X=0`, we have `j_X=s_X`. So this would require `s_X=0`. OK.\n*   Conclusion: Not Permitted due to violation of the Pauli statistics rule.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\n\nWe have found two forbidden transitions:\n*   A is forbidden because the final NN state `7D1` (`S=3`) cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n*   D is forbidden because the final NN state configuration (`3P0` with `T=0`) violates the given Pauli statistics requirement (`S_f+L_f` must be odd).\n\nBoth A and D describe an impossible process. However, the question provides an explicit and somewhat complex rule regarding Pauli statistics (`T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`) and instructs to \"Make use of\" the conservation laws. This strongly suggests that the intended forbidden answer is the one that violates these specific rules of the decay process. Option D is the only one that fails this test. The impossible spin in option A can be seen as either a typo in the problem or a \"distractor\" that relies on knowledge outside the immediate decay-rule framework presented. Following the logic prescribed by the problem leads directly to D being forbidden.\n\n<<<D>>>"
