    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state (Δt or τ) to the uncertainty or \"width\" of its energy level (ΔE). This relationship is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\n    For an unstable state with a lifetime τ, the uncertainty in time Δt is the lifetime τ itself. The uncertainty in energy ΔE represents the natural linewidth or the inherent \"fuzziness\" of the energy level. A common and useful approximation for the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the energy level is:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Define the Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference in their energies must be significantly larger than their combined uncertainty. A standard criterion for clear resolution (similar to the Rayleigh criterion in optics) is that the energy separation must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2).\n    \n    Required condition: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Widths (ΔE1 and ΔE2):**\n    We need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of electron-volts times seconds (eV·s), as the lifetimes are in seconds and the final answers are in eV.\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   Lifetime of the first state, τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of the second state, τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n    Now, we calculate the energy width for each state:\n    *   ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Minimum Energy Difference for Resolution:**\n    Using our resolution condition, the minimum energy difference is the sum of the individual widths:\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n    |E1 - E2| > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    |E1 - E2| > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    |E1 - E2| > 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    So, to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    We need to find the option that satisfies the condition |E1 - E2| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV:  10⁻⁴ is indeed greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷. (10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV:  10⁻⁹ is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV:  10⁻⁸ is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷. (10⁻⁸ = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: 10⁻¹¹ is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Only option A provides an energy difference large enough to ensure the two energy levels are clearly resolved.\n\nWe can use a Python script to perform the calculation precisely.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar = 6.582119569e-16 # eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9 # s\ntau2 = 1e-8 # s\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state using the uncertainty principle (Delta_E = h_bar / tau)\nDelta_E1 = h_bar / tau1\nDelta_E2 = h_bar / tau2\n\n# To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be greater\n# than the sum of their individual widths.

    "The problem relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the inherent uncertainty (or \"width\") of its energy level, a concept described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) must be greater than or equal to a constant value related to the Planck constant:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor practical purposes and calculations involving the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of an energy level, this is often approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the energy width of the state.\n*   τ is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy Widths**\n\nWe need to calculate the energy width for each of the two states.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. The Condition for Resolution**\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than this sum, the energy levels will significantly overlap and appear as a single, broader peak.\n\nResolution condition: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n**4. Minimum Required Energy Difference**\n\nLet's calculate the minimum energy difference required for resolution:\n\nMinimum |E₁ - E₂| = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nMinimum |E₁ - E₂| = (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\nMinimum |E₁ - E₂| ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\nMinimum |E₁ - E₂| ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, the energy difference between the two levels must be greater than approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\nNow we check which of the given options satisfies this condition:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much greater than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷)\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is less than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is less than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁸ = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷)\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much less than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy separation that is large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.\n\n<<<A>>>"
