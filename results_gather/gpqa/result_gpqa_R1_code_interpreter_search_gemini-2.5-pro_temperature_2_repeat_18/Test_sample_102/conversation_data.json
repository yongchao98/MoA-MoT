    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's identify the substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* (1,3,5) relationship to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on the ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromine atom (-Br):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies**\n\nThe goal is to add these three groups in an order that leverages their directing effects to achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern with high yield.\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation Constraint:** The Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the -COCH3 group) is a crucial step. This reaction does not work on moderately or strongly deactivated rings. This means it must be performed before adding strong deactivating groups like the nitro group, or on rings where deactivation is minimal. Therefore, acylation must be one of the first steps. This immediately makes options **B** and potentially C (if the deactivation by Br is tolerated) more plausible than A and D, where acylation is attempted after nitration.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Option C:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene (-Br is an o,p-director).\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product). The substituents are at positions 1 and 4, which does not lead to the desired 1,3,5 pattern.\n    *   iii) Acylation of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group, so this Friedel-Crafts reaction would fail or have extremely low yield. Thus, Option C is not a viable path.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation of Aniline. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring. This prevents the desired Friedel-Crafts acylation on the ring. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`\n    *   This sequence starts with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline, diazotization, and then deamination with H3PO2. This sequence (NO2 → NH2 → N2+ → H) effectively removes the nitro group, taking you from nitrobenzene back to benzene. This is a circular and pointless route. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Option B:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence starts with Friedel-Crafts acylation, which is a good strategy. Let's analyze the steps:\n    *   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is the standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a meta-director.\n    *   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3. This is a standard and effective reaction. Now we have substituents at positions 1 and 3.\n    *   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → ?** This is the key step. The substrate has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to its ortho (C2, C4) and para (C6, but that's C2 again due to numbering) positions. It seems there's a conflict.\n        *   However, experimental evidence shows that the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone gives 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product (with reported yields around 57-66%). The incoming nitro group is directed to position 5. So this step successfully produces the target molecule.\n\nThe first three steps of option B constitute a valid, high-yield synthesis of the desired product.\n`Benzene --(i)--> Acetophenone --(ii)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone --(iii)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one`\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv, v, vi, vii) listed in option B are nonsensical as they would involve further reactions on the final product. It is very likely that these are extraneous steps included in a flawed multiple-choice question. The core of the synthesis, and the only plausible route among the options, is contained in the first three steps of B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
