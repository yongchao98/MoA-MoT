    "This problem requires us to determine the total energy of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well for its three lowest energy states.\n\n**1. Understand the Basics**\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Being fermions, these particles must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by both its energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and its spin projection (`m_s`).\n*   **Spin States:** For a spin-1/2 particle, there are two possible spin states: spin up (`m_s` = +1/2) and spin down (`m_s` = -1/2).\n*   **Implication of Pauli Principle:** Due to the two spin states, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle of mass `m` in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L`, the allowed energy levels are given by:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem defines a base unit of energy `E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}`. So, we can express the single-particle energy levels simply as:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n**3. Calculating the Total Energies**\n\nWe need to place the four fermions into these energy levels to find the total energy of the system for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n*   **Ground State (Lowest Total Energy)**\n    To achieve the lowest possible total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n    *   We place the first two particles into the `n=1` level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy contributed is `2 * E_1 = 2 * E = 2E`.\n    *   We place the next two particles into the `n=2` level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy contributed is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E`.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n        $E_{ground} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n*   **First Excited State (Next Lowest Total Energy)**\n    To get the first excited state, we must promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level in the least \"expensive\" way (i.e., the smallest energy jump). The ground state configuration has the `n=1` and `n=2` levels filled. The lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`. The cheapest excitation is to move a particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n    *   The new configuration is: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, and 1 particle in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy for this configuration is:\n        $E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n        $E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n*   **Second Excited State (Third Lowest Total Energy)**\n    We need to find the configuration with the next lowest energy. Let's consider the possible excitations from the ground state that result in a higher energy than the first excited state (15E).\n    *   **Possibility 1:** Excite a particle from `n=1` (instead of `n=2`) to the lowest empty level `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: 1 particle in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = E + 2(4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** Excite two particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 0 particles in `n=2`, 2 particles in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Possibility 3:** Excite one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=4`.\n        *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\n    Comparing the energies of these excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n    *   $E_{2nd\\_excited} = 18E$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
