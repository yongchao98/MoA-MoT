    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** We are asked to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`. The integral is `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n    *   The vector field `f` has a magnitude `|f| = 1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In vector form, this is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Tool:** This problem is a classic application of the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface enclosing the volume. The theorem is stated as:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    where `S` is the closed surface bounding the volume `V`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Surface S and the Field on the Surface:**\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The bounding surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n    *   The vector field on the surface `S` is found by setting `r = R` in the expression for `f`. So, on the surface, `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n\n4.  **Define the Differential Surface Element dS:**\n    *   For a sphere, the outward-pointing normal vector is in the radial direction, i.e., `n = r_hat`.\n    *   The differential area element in spherical coordinates is `dA = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    *   The vector differential surface element `dS` is `dS = n * dA = r_hat * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):**\n    *   `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ r_hat * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ ]`\n    *   Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    *   `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    *   Now we integrate `f ⋅ dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration in spherical coordinates for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    *   `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   First, integrate with respect to `θ`:\n        `∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   Next, integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n        `∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ](from 0 to 2π) = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   By the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV` is equal to the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   We calculated the surface integral to be `4π`.\n    *   Therefore, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n\n**Alternative Consideration (The Singularity):**\nOne might be tempted to first calculate the divergence of `f`. In spherical coordinates, for `f = f_r(r) * r_hat`, the divergence is `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`.\nFor `f_r = 1/r^2`, `r^2 * f_r = 1`. The derivative `∂(1)/∂r = 0`. So, `∇ ⋅ f = 0` for any `r ≠ 0`.\nIf we naively integrate `0` over the volume, we get `0`. This is incorrect because it ignores the fact that the field `f` and its divergence are undefined (singular) at the origin `r=0`.\nThe divergence is actually `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ^3(r)`, where `δ^3(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. The integral of this over any volume containing the origin is `4π`.\nThe Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this singularity by shifting the calculation to the boundary surface, where the field is well-defined.\n\nComparing our result `4π` with the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 0\nC) 4 π\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
