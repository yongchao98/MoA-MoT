    "```python\n# Analysis of spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n# The user provides Mass Spec, IR, and 1H NMR data.\n# I will break down the analysis for each piece of data and then evaluate the given options.\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry data.\n# - Molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156. This suggests the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes is 156 g/mol.\n# - A peak at m/z = 158 (M+2).\n# - The intensity ratio of the M+ peak (156) to the M+2 peak (158) is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n# - This characteristic 3:1 ratio for M+ to M+2 is a classic indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule. Chlorine has two stable isotopes: 35Cl (approx. 75% abundance) and 37Cl (approx. 25% abundance). The M+ peak corresponds to the molecule containing 35Cl, and the M+2 peak corresponds to the molecule containing 37Cl.\n# - So, the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the 35Cl version) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectroscopy data.\n# - A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm-1. This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n# - A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm-1. This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The position (around 1700-1725 cm-1 for aromatic acids) is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid.\n# - Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid group.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectroscopy data.\n# - 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): A chemical shift in the 10-13 ppm range is highly diagnostic for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO*H*). The 's' indicates it's a singlet (it has no adjacent protons to couple with), and '1H' confirms it represents a single proton. This strongly corroborates the IR data.\n# - 8.02 ppm (d, 2H): This signal is in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). 'd' indicates it's a doublet, and '2H' means it corresponds to two equivalent protons. The doublet splitting means these two protons are adjacent to one or more other protons.\n# - 7.72 ppm (d, 2H): This is another signal in the aromatic region, also a doublet representing two equivalent protons.\n# - The overall aromatic pattern (a doublet for 2H and another doublet for 2H) is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (or 'para') benzene ring. In a para-disubstituted ring, the two protons ortho to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\n# Step 4: Synthesize the findings and evaluate the options.\n# - From MS: MW = 156 (with 35Cl), contains one Cl.\n# - From IR and NMR: Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n# - From NMR: Contains a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n# - Combining these facts points to a molecule that is a chlorobenzoic acid with a para substitution pattern.\n\n# Let's check the options:\n# A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: (Ortho-substituted). This has the correct formula (C7H5ClO2) and molecular weight (~156). However, the ortho substitution pattern would give a much more complex 1H NMR signal for the 4 aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n# B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: (Para-substituted). This has the correct formula (C7H5ClO2) and molecular weight (~156). It has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in a 1,4- (para) arrangement on a benzene ring. This substitution pattern perfectly matches the observed 1H NMR spectrum (two doublets, each integrating to 2H). The IR and MS data are also fully consistent with this structure.\n# C) Phenyl chloroformate: (Structure C6H5-O-C(=O)Cl). While it has the correct MW, it is an acid chloride/ester, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H IR stretch and the carboxylic acid proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the 1H NMR.\n# D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a 1H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm (the aldehyde H is ~9-10 ppm) and the IR C=O stretch would be different. The substitution pattern is also incorrect for the NMR data.\n\n# Final Conclusion: All pieces of evidence point to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n# Let's calculate the expected molecular weight for confirmation.\n# Formula: C7H5ClO2\n# Using integer masses for the M+ peak: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 35 + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n# This matches the M+ peak at m/z = 156. The calculation confirms the molecular formula is consistent with the data.\n\nprint(\"Based on the analysis of all spectral data:\")\nprint(\"1.

    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158, which is M+2.\n    *   The intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1.\n    *   This characteristic 3:1 ratio for the M+ and M+2 peaks is a strong indication that the molecule contains one chlorine atom. Chlorine has two naturally occurring stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75.77% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~24.23% abundance). The M+ peak corresponds to the molecule containing ³⁵Cl, and the M+2 peak corresponds to the molecule containing ³⁷Cl. The abundance ratio is approximately 3:1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (when containing ³⁵Cl) and has one chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **Analyze Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   There is a very broad absorption peak in the range of 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. This is a classic textbook signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp absorption peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group's stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n3.  **Analyze ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield, typically between 10-13 ppm, is highly diagnostic for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The \"s\" for singlet indicates it does not couple with any neighboring protons (which is expected for a COOH proton), and \"1H\" integration confirms it represents one proton. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n        *   The presence of two signals means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons.\n        *   Each signal is a doublet (\"d\"), meaning the protons of each type are split by protons on an adjacent carbon.\n        *   Each signal integrates to two protons (\"2H\"), meaning there are two equivalent protons of each type.\n        *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. In this pattern, the two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent and are split by the protons ortho to the other substituent, and vice versa.\n\n4.  **Synthesize All Data and Evaluate Options:**\n    *   **Summary:** We are looking for a molecule with a molecular weight of 156, containing one chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-(1,2)-disubstituted ring. The four aromatic protons would not be symmetrically equivalent and would produce a more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom on a benzene ring in a 1,4 (*para*) arrangement. This structure perfectly matches the 1H NMR data (two doublets for 4 aromatic protons). It has a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal. Let's check its molecular weight: C₇H₅ClO₂. MW = (7 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (35.45) + (2 × 16.00) ≈ 156.5 g/mol. Using integer mass for the most common isotopes: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 35 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This perfectly matches the mass spectrometry data. This candidate is consistent with all pieces of evidence.\n        *   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** The structure is C₆H₅OC(O)Cl. This is an acyl chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H stretch in the IR and the characteristic carboxylic acid proton signal at 11 ppm in the NMR.\n        *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. While it has an OH group, the aldehyde C=O stretch would be at a different frequency in the IR. The aldehyde proton (-CHO) would appear around 9-10 ppm in the NMR, and we don't see that. Also, the 1,2,3-substitution pattern would give a more complex aromatic region in the NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** All spectral data point unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
