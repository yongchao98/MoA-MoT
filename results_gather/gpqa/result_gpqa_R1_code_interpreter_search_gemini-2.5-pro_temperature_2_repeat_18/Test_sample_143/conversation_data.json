    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   Production energy of X, $E_{X} = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Mass of X, $m_{X} = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$ (or $1.2 \\, \\text{GeV/c}^2$)\n    *   Decay width of X, $\\Gamma_{X} = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n3.  **Recall Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($d$) of a particle in the lab frame is the distance it travels, on average, before decaying. It is given by the product of its velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$).\n        $d = v \\cdot t_{lab}$\n    *   The mean lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$) is related to the proper mean lifetime ($\\tau$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n    *   The particle's velocity is $v = \\beta c$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   Combining these, the mean decay distance is $d = (\\beta c)(\\gamma \\tau) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$.\n    *   The proper mean lifetime ($\\tau$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n        $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Substituting $\\tau$ into the expression for $d$, we get:\n        $d = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Calculation Strategy:**\n    *   It is most convenient to work with units common in particle physics, like MeV for energy, mass, and width, and MeVÂ·fm for $\\hbar c$. This avoids dealing with many powers of 10 in intermediate steps.\n    *   The term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be calculated from the given energy ($E$) and mass ($m$). The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The momentum is also given by $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m \\beta c$.\n    *   From these relations, we can derive an expression for $\\gamma \\beta$:\n        $pc = \\gamma \\beta (mc^2)$\n        $\\implies \\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$\n    *   Once $\\gamma \\beta$ is calculated, we can plug it into the formula for the decay distance:\n        $d = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   First, ensure all units are consistent. Let's use MeV.\n        *   $E = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} = 8000 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n        *   $m c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n        *   $\\Gamma = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   Use the standard value for the physical constant $\\hbar c$:\n        *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$\n    *   Calculate the $\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$ term:\n        *   $\\sqrt{(8000)^2 - (1200)^2} = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\, \\text{MeV} \\approx 7909.488 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   Calculate $\\gamma \\beta$:\n        *   $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{7909.488 \\, \\text{MeV}}{1200 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 6.59124$\n    *   Now, calculate the mean decay distance $d$:\n        *   $d = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma} = 6.59124 \\times \\frac{197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}}$\n        *   $d \\approx 6.59124 \\times 0.616647 \\, \\text{fm} \\approx 4.0655 \\, \\text{fm}$\n    *   Convert the final result from femtometers (fm) to meters (m):\n        *   $1 \\, \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n        *   $d \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\nTo ensure precision, the calculation can be performed using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants and given values\n# hbar_c in MeV.fm (1 fm = 1e-15 m)\nhbar_c_MeV_fm = 197.3269804\n\n# Given values in MeV\nE_MeV = 8000.0   # Production energy E_X = 8 GeV\nm_MeV = 1200.0   # Mass m_X = 1.2 GeV\nGamma_MeV = 320.0 # Width Gamma_X = 320 MeV\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n\n# Calculate the momentum in MeV/c\n# E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2  => pc = sqrt(E^2 - (mc^2)^2)\npc_MeV = math.sqrt(E_MeV**2 - m_MeV**2)\n\n# Calculate the gamma * beta term\n# gamma*beta = p/m = pc/(mc^2)\ngamma_beta = pc_MeV / m_MeV\n\n# Calculate the proper mean lifetime multiplied by c (proper decay length)\n# tau = hbar / Gamma => c*tau = hbar*c / Gamma\nc_tau_fm = hbar_c_MeV_fm / Gamma_MeV\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance in the lab frame\n# d = gamma * beta * c * tau\nd_fm = gamma_beta * c_tau_fm\n\n# Convert the result from femtometers to meters\nd_m = d_fm * 1e-15\n\nprint(f\"{d_m:.4e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n4.0655e-15\n</execute_result>\n\n6.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated mean decay distance is $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n    B) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n    C) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n    D) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\n    The calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning process is correct and the python script generated is a valid way to calculate the solution.\nHere's a breakdown of the steps performed in the initial reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing equation:** The mean decay distance ($d$) in the laboratory frame is the product of the particle's lab-frame lifetime ($t_{lab}$) and its velocity ($v$). This is affected by time dilation, so $d = \\gamma v \\tau_{0} = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_{0}$, where $\\tau_{0}$ is the proper lifetime and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Relate Lifetime to Width:** The proper lifetime ($\\tau_{0}$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau_{0} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$.\n\n3.  **Combine Equations:** Substituting the lifetime into the distance equation gives:\n    $d = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Term ($\\gamma \\beta$):** This term can be calculated directly from the particle's energy and mass.\n    *   The total energy is $E = \\gamma mc^2$.\n    *   The relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$.\n    *   The energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    *   From this, we can find the momentum: $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n    *   Then we can find $\\gamma\\beta$: $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{p}{m} = \\frac{pc}{mc^2}$.\n\n5.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   $E = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} = 8000 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $mc^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$\n\n    *   Calculate $pc$:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{(8000)^2 - (1200)^2} = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\approx 7909.49 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Calculate $\\gamma\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{7909.49 \\, \\text{MeV}}{1200 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 6.5912$.\n    *   Calculate the final distance $d$:\n        $d = (6.5912) \\times \\frac{197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 4.0655 \\, \\text{fm}$.\n\n6.  **Convert Units:** Since $1 \\, \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$, the mean decay distance is $d \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nThe code executed correctly performed these steps and yielded the result `4.0655e-15`, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
