    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model:** The problem specifies the quantum rotation-vibration model (also known as the non-rigid rotor model) for a diatomic molecule. The energy levels in this model are given by the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies:\n    `E(v, J) = Ev + Er = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J + 1)`\n    where:\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (`v = 0, 1, 2, ...`).\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number (`J = 0, 1, 2, ...`).\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant, `B = ħ² / (2I)`.\n    *   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n2.  **Define the States:**\n    *   **Fundamental State (Initial State):** This is the ground state, which has the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are zero: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n        *   `Ei = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n    *   **Next State (Final State):** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to a higher energy state. We need to find the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This implies finding the smallest possible energy jump `ΔE` from the ground state that is allowed by the quantum mechanical selection rules.\n\n3.  **Apply Selection Rules:** For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule (like XY) to absorb a photon, the transition must obey specific selection rules:\n    *   `Δv = +1` (for absorption).\n    *   `ΔJ = ±1`.\n    \n    Starting from the initial state `(v=0, J=0)`:\n    *   `Δv = +1` means the final vibrational state must be `v = 1`.\n    *   `ΔJ = +1` is the only possibility, as `J` cannot decrease from 0. So, the final rotational state must be `J = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the lowest-energy allowed transition from the ground state is from `(v=0, J=0)` to `(v=1, J=1)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n    *   Initial energy: `Ei = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω`\n    *   Final energy: `Ef = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n    *   The energy of the absorbed photon, `E_photon`, must be equal to this energy difference `ΔE`:\n        *   `E_photon = ΔE = Ef - Ei = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]`\n        *   `E_photon = ħω + 2B`\n        *   Substituting `B = ħ² / (2I)`, we get: `ΔE = ħω + 2 * (ħ² / (2I)) = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n5.  **Calculate Numerical Values:** We need to compute the moment of inertia (`I`) first, and then the total energy change `ΔE`.\n\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        *   `Mx = 20 amu`, `My = 2 amu`\n        *   `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu`\n        *   Convert to kg: `μ = 1.818 * 1.66054 * 10^(-27) kg ≈ 3.019 * 10^(-27) kg`\n\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        *   `R = 2 angstroms = 2 * 10^(-10) m`\n        *   `I = μ * R² = (3.019 * 10^(-27) kg) * (2 * 10^(-10) m)²`\n        *   `I ≈ 1.208 * 10^(-46) kg·m²`\n\n    *   **Energy Components:**\n        *   Vibrational energy term: `ħω = (1.05457 * 10^(-34) J·s) * (4 * 10^14 rad/s) = 4.218 * 10^(-20) J`\n        *   Rotational energy term: `ħ²/I = (1.05457 * 10^(-34) J·s)² / (1.208 * 10^(-46) kg·m²) ≈ 9.21 * 10^(-23) J`\n\n    *   **Total Photon Energy (ΔE):**\n        *   `ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I = 4.218 * 10^(-20) J + 9.21 * 10^(-23) J ≈ 4.227 * 10^(-20) J`\n        *(Note that the rotational energy contribution is about 0.2% of the vibrational energy contribution, but should still be included for accuracy).*\n\n6.  **Calculate Photon Momentum (p):**\n    *   The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `p = E / c`\n    *   `p = (4.227 * 10^(-20) J) / (2.998 * 10^8 m/s)`\n    *   `p ≈ 1.4099 * 10^(-28) N·s`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   `p ≈ 1.41 * 10^(-28) N·s`\n    *   Option A is `1.4 * 10^(-28) N·s`.\n    *   This matches our calculated result.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculation is performed using a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants\nhbar = 1.054571817e-34  # J*s (Reduced Planck constant)\namu_to_kg = 1.66053906660e-27 # kg\nangstrom_to_m = 1e-10 # m\nc = 299792458 # m/s (speed of light)\n\n# Input parameters from the problem\nMx_amu = 20\nMy_amu = 2\nR_angstrom = 2\nomega = 4e14 # rad/s\n\n# Convert inputs to SI units\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nR_m = R_angstrom * angstrom_to_m\n\n# 1.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Model and Energy Levels\n\nThe problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model) for a diatomic molecule. In this model, the total energy of the molecule is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies. The energy levels are quantized and described by the formula:\n\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B * J(J + 1)\n\nwhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, which depends on the molecule's moment of inertia, `I`: `B = ħ² / (2I)`.\n*   The moment of inertia `I` is given by `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass of the molecule and `R` is the bond length.\n\n### 2. Identifying the States and Transition\n\n*   **Initial State (Fundamental State):** The fundamental state is the ground state, which has the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum values: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\n*   **Final State (Next Lowest Energy State):** For a photon to be absorbed by a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the transition must obey specific selection rules:\n    *   `Δv = +1`\n    *   `ΔJ = ±1`\n    \n    Starting from the initial state (v=0, J=0):\n    *   The change in `v` must be `+1`, so the final `v` is `1`.\n    *   The change in `J` can be `+1` or `-1`. Since `J` cannot be negative, the only possibility is `ΔJ = +1`, leading to a final `J` of `1`.\n\n    Therefore, the transition is from the state `(v=0, J=0)` to the state `(v=1, J=1)`. The energy of this final state is:\n    *   `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Energy of the Absorbed Photon\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (`E_photon`) must be equal to the difference in energy between the final and initial states (`ΔE`).\n\n*   `ΔE = E_final - E_initial`\n*   `ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]`\n*   `ΔE = ħω + 2B`\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for the rotational constant, `B = ħ² / (2I)`:\n\n*   `ΔE = ħω + 2 * (ħ² / (2I)) = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n### 4. Relating Photon Energy to Momentum\n\nThe energy of a photon (`E`) is related to its momentum (`p`) by the equation `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light. Therefore, the momentum of the absorbed photon is:\n\n*   `p = E_photon / c = ΔE / c`\n*   `p = (ħω + ħ²/I) / c`\n\n### 5. Numerical Calculation\n\nTo find the numerical value of `p`, we need to calculate the reduced mass (`μ`) and the moment of inertia (`I`) in SI units first. The following Python code performs these calculations systematically.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants\nhbar = 1.054571817e-34  # J*s (Reduced Planck constant)\namu_to_kg = 1.66053906660e-27 # kg\nangstrom_to_m = 1e-10 # m\nc = 299792458 # m/s (speed of light)\n\n# Input parameters from the problem\nMx_amu = 20\nMy_amu = 2\nR_angstrom = 2\nomega = 4e14 # rad/s\n\n# Convert inputs to SI units\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nR_m = R_angstrom * angstrom_to_m\n\n# 1. Calculate the reduced mass (mu) of the molecule\nmu_kg = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)\n\n# 2. Calculate the moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu_kg * R_m**2\n\n# 3. Calculate the energy of the photon (delta_E)\n# The transition is from ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next lowest allowed state (v=1, J=1).\n# The energy required for this transition is delta_E = hbar*omega + hbar^2/I\ndelta_E = (hbar * omega) + (hbar**2 / I)\n\n# 4. Calculate the momentum of the photon (p)\n# E = p*c  => p = E/c\np = delta_E / c\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"{p:.2e}\")\n```\n\nThe code executes the formula derived above and yields a momentum `p ≈ 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`. This value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
