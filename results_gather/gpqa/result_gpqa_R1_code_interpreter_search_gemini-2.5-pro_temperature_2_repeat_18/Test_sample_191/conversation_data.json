    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. A positive charge `+q` is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Induction of Charges:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons in the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n    *   Electrons will be attracted towards the `+q` charge, accumulating on the inner surface of the cavity. To completely cancel the electric field from the `+q` charge *within the conductor material*, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law applied to a Gaussian surface drawn entirely within the conducting material and enclosing the cavity. Since the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero, the net enclosed charge must be zero.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. This `+q` charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that they provide electrostatic shielding. The cavity and its contents (the original `+q` charge and the induced `-q` on the inner wall) are completely shielded from the outside region by the conducting material. This means the arrangement of charges inside the cavity has no effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` that appears on the outer surface will distribute itself in a way that minimizes repulsion. Since the conductor is spherical and isolated from any other external fields (the internal field is shielded), the `+q` charge will spread out uniformly over the outer spherical surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** Now, we need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The field at P is the superposition of the fields from all charges. However, due to shielding, the net effect of the charges inside the cavity (the original `+q` and the induced `-q`) on the field outside is zero. Therefore, the only charge that contributes to the electric field at point P is the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** According to a well-known result from electrostatics (derivable from Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of this charge distribution is the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` at a distance `L`:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The distances `l` and `s`, and the angle `theta`, which describe the specific location of the charge within the cavity and the location of point P relative to the cavity, are irrelevant for determining the electric field outside the conductor. The correct expression only depends on the total charge `q` and the distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
