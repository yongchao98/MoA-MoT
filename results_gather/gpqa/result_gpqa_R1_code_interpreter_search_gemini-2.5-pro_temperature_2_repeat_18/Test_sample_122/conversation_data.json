    "This is a problem of special relativity. I need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  Identify the given values.\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's moving frame (proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. For more precision, I'll use `c = 299,792.458 km/s`.\n\n2.  The core concept here is time dilation. The time measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will be longer than the time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt'` is the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame, and `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  The Lorentz factor `γ` is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  Once I find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`), I can calculate the distance the ejecta traveled in that frame using the standard formula:\n    `distance = v * Δt`\n\nSo, the full calculation is:\n`distance = v * (γ * Δt') = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt'`\n\nI will use a Python script to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy\nv = 60000  # km/s\n# Time passed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time)\ndt_prime = 50  # s\n# Speed of light in vacuum\nc = 299792.458  # km/s\n\n# 1.

This is the *proper time* because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in its own frame.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 299,792.458 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Apply the time dilation formula:**\n    An observer in the stationary frame (S, the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt'`). The relationship is given by:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    First, find the ratio `β = v/c`:\n    `β = 60,000 km/s / 299,792.458 km/s ≈ 0.2001`\n    Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2001)²) ≈ 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04004) ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.95996) ≈ 1.0206`\n\n5.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame:**\n    The distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy's frame is the relative velocity `v` multiplied by the time `Δt` measured in that same frame.\n    `Distance = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThe result `3,061,862 km` is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a classic problem involving the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The \"stationary\" frame of reference is the Galaxy (let's call it frame S).\n    *   The \"moving\" frame of reference is the supernova ejecta (let's call it frame S').\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time that passes in the moving frame S' (the ejecta's own clock) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is known as the \"proper time\".\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`. Using this common approximation is standard for such problems unless specified otherwise.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels *as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S)*. The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`. We need to use the time as measured in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n\n4.  **Apply the Concept of Time Dilation:**\n    According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) compared to the time measured in the moving frame (`Δt'`). This phenomenon is called time dilation and is described by the formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    First, let's calculate the ratio `v/c`, also known as beta (`β`):\n    `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, plug this into the gamma formula:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n    `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.02062`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt):**\n    Now we can find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame of reference:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame:**\n    Finally, we calculate the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy. We use the velocity `v` and the time `Δt` that we just calculated for the Galaxy's frame.\n    `Distance = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    Let's look at the given options:\n    A) 2,880,000 km\n    B) 3,000,000 km\n    C) 2,940,000 km\n    D) 3,060,000 km\n\n    Our calculated value of 3,061,862 km is extremely close to option D. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the options.\n\nTo confirm the calculation with high precision, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy\nv = 60000  # km/s\n# Time passed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time)\ndt_prime = 50  # s\n# Use the approximate speed of light, as is common in these problems\nc = 300000  # km/s\n\n# 1.
