    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent is used for epoxidation. The addition of the oxygen atom across the double bond is a *syn*-addition, meaning both C-O bonds form on the same face of the alkene.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent is used for the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step process (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-hydrolysis) is equivalent to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemistry of the product depends on the starting alkene and the type of addition. The rule for *anti*-addition is:\n    *   *trans*-alkene + *anti*-addition → *meso*-compound\n    *   *cis*-alkene + *anti*-addition → racemic mixture (pair of enantiomers)\n\n    Since (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene, its *anti*-dihydroxylation yields a *meso*-compound. The product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule, even though it has chiral centers ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol).\n\n    **Product of Reaction 1: 1 compound (meso-diol)**\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Applying the rule for *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene:\n    *   *cis*-alkene + *anti*-addition → racemic mixture\n\n    The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two enantiomers.\n\n    **Products of Reaction 2: 2 compounds (a pair of enantiomers)**\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct molecules:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three compounds are all stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol.\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe chemist analyzes this three-component mixture using two different HPLC techniques.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral chromatography separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.\n    *   Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) will co-elute (exit the column at the same time), appearing as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**. (Peak 1: racemic mixture; Peak 2: meso-compound).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral chromatography uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows the column to differentiate between enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, leading to different retention times.\n    *   It also separates diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**. (Peak 1: meso-compound; Peak 2: (4R,5R)-diol; Peak 3: (4S,5S)-diol).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
