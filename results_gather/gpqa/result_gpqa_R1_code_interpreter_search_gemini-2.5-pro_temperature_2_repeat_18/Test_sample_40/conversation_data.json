    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference**\n    *   **Lab Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference. In this frame, the observer is stationary, and the glass is moving with velocity `v`. We need to find the speed of light (`u`) in this frame.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference in which the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Determine the Velocities in Each Frame**\n    *   **Velocity of light in the Glass Frame (u'):** The index of refraction (`n`) is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`).\n        `n = c / u'`\n        The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c = 1`. Therefore:\n        `n = 1 / u'`\n        Solving for `u'`, the speed of light as measured by an observer in the rest frame of the glass is:\n        `u' = 1/n`\n    *   **Velocity of the Glass Frame relative to the Lab Frame:** This is given as `v`. Since the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, we will treat `v` as positive.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula**\n    To find the speed of light `u` as measured by the observer in the lab frame (S), we must use the Einstein velocity-addition formula. When the velocities are in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' * v / c^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in frame S.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in frame S'.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values**\n    Now, substitute the values `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression**\n    To simplify the complex fraction, multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( 1/n + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options**\n    The derived expression `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option C.\n\n    *   A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    *   B) 1\n    *   C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
