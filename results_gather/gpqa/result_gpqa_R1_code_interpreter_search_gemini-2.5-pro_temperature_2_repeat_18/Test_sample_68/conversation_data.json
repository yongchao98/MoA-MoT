    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\nThe problem involves the decay of a relativistic particle. The key concepts are:\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle is moving at a high energy, so its lifetime and travel distance in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber) are different from its proper lifetime and travel distance. This is governed by time dilation.\n*   **Particle Decay:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The number of particles that survive for a time `t` is proportional to `exp(-t/τ)`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime in the relevant reference frame.\n*   **Detector Resolution:** To \"observe\" the decay means that we can see the track of the parent particle ($X^0$) before it decays. This is only possible if the distance it travels before decaying is larger than the spatial resolution of our detector.\n\n### 2. Identify Given Information\n*   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}$ s\n*   Energy of $X^0$ in the lab frame: $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass of $X^0$: $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV (this is actually $m_0c^2$, but in particle physics units where c=1, we can just use the value for mass).\n*   Condition: We need to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step a: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the total energy of a particle to its rest mass energy ($E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$). Since both are given in GeV, we can write:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n**Step b: Calculate the Mean Lifetime in the Lab Frame ($\\tau$)**\nDue to time dilation, the lifetime of the particle as observed in the lab is longer than its proper lifetime:\n$\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\n**Step c: Calculate the Particle's Velocity ($v$)**\nThe velocity is related to the Lorentz factor. We can express it as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\nHowever, a more direct way that avoids intermediate rounding errors is to use the relativistic momentum.\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$. From this, we can find the momentum, `p`.\nThen, we can use the relation $v = \\frac{p c^2}{E}$, which simplifies to $\\beta = \\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{pc}{E}$.\n\n**Step d: Calculate the Mean Decay Length in the Lab Frame ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is the product of its velocity and its lab-frame lifetime:\n$\\lambda = v \\tau = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau_0)$\nA useful combined formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} c \\tau_0$, where $p$ is the relativistic momentum.\n\n**Step e: Relate Decay Length to Observation Probability**\nThe probability that a particle travels a distance `l` or more before decaying follows the exponential decay law:\n$P(\\text{distance} \\ge L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\nwhere `L` is a specific distance and `λ` is the mean decay length.\n\n**Step f: Solve for the Minimum Resolution**\nWe are asked for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. Let the resolution of the detector be `R`. To \"observe\" a decay, the track length `L` must be greater than `R` ($L > R$). We want this to happen for at least 30% of the particles.\n$P(L > R) \\ge 0.30$\n$e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\nThis inequality sets an upper limit on the resolution `R`:\n$-R/\\lambda \\ge \\ln(0.30)$\n$R/\\lambda \\le -\\ln(0.30)$\n$R \\le -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution\", which is ambiguous. It could mean the highest resolution (smallest `R`), or the minimum *requirement* for the resolution (largest acceptable `R`). The latter interpretation, also known as the \"worst acceptable resolution\", gives us the threshold value. Let's calculate this threshold.\n\n$R_{max} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) \\approx 1.204 \\lambda$\n\nAny detector with a resolution $R \\le R_{max}$ will be able to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\n### 4. Computation\nI will now use Python to perform the calculation with high precision to avoid rounding errors.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # proper lifetime in seconds\nE = 27.0        # energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41       # mass in GeV/c^2\nc = 299792458   # speed of light in m/s\nprob = 0.30     # probability threshold\n\n# Calculate the momentum in units of GeV/c\n# E^2 = (pc)^2 + m0^2  (in natural units)\npc = math.sqrt(E**2 - m0**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame (lambda)\n# lambda = (p/m0) * c * tau0, where p = pc/c and m0 = m0_mass_val/c^2\n# lambda = (pc / m0) * c * tau0\nlab_decay_length = (pc / m0) * c * tau0\n\n# Calculate the maximum resolution (R_max) that satisfies the condition\n# R <= -lambda * ln(prob)\nR_max = -lab_decay_length * math.log(prob)\n\nprint(f\"{R_max:.3e}\")\n```\n2.268e-06\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe calculation gives the maximum allowed resolution as $R_{max} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The detector's resolution, `R`, must satisfy $R \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nComparing the options to our requirement ($R \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m):\n*   Option A: $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m is much smaller than the limit, so it works. It would observe nearly 100% of the decays.\n*   Option B: $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m is much larger than the limit. It doesn't work.\n*   Option C: $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is smaller than the limit, so it works. Let's check the fraction of decays it would observe: $P = \\exp(-2.08\\text{e-}6 / \\lambda) = \\exp(-2.08\\text{e-}6 / (1.884\\text{e-}6)) = \\exp(-1.104) \\approx 0.33$. This is indeed greater than 30%.\n*   Option D: $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m is much larger than the limit. It doesn't work.\n\nBoth A and C are technically correct answers. However, in the context of such problems, \"minimum resolution needed\" usually refers to the option that is just sufficient to meet the requirement. A resolution of $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m is an extremely high (and expensive) resolution that is far more than what is needed. Option C represents a resolution that is of the correct order of magnitude and just meets the stated requirement. The small difference between the calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the option ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is likely due to rounding in the problem's design. Therefore, Option C is the most reasonable answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a particle, $X^0$. To observe a decay means that the particle must travel a distance `L` that is greater than the detector's spatial resolution, `R`. So, we need to find the resolution `R` such that the probability of the travel distance `L` being greater than `R` is at least 0.30.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Kinematics:** The particle $X^0$ is moving at a relativistic speed. Its properties in the lab frame (Bubble Chamber) will be different from its properties in its own rest frame (proper frame). We need to use the principles of special relativity.\n\n3.  **Key Quantities to Calculate:**\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor relates the energy and mass of the particle. It is crucial for calculating time dilation and length contraction (though length contraction is not directly needed here). The formula is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $E$ is the total energy and $m_0 c^2$ is the rest mass energy.\n    *   **Lab-frame Lifetime ($\\tau$):** Due to time dilation, the particle's average lifetime in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). The relation is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   **Particle Velocity ($v$) or $\\beta=v/c$:** We need the particle's speed in the lab frame to find the distance it travels.\n    *   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It's calculated as $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$.\n\n4.  **Step-by-Step Calculation Plan:**\n\n    a.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**:\n        The problem gives the energy $E=27$ GeV and the mass $m_0=3.41$ GeV/$c^2$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n    b.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**:\n        The mean decay length in the lab frame is $\\lambda = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$.\n        A more direct formula combines momentum and mass: $\\lambda = \\frac{p c}{m_0 c^2} \\cdot c \\tau_0$.\n        First, we find the momentum-energy product, $pc$, using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2$ GeV$^2$.\n        $pc = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV.\n        Now, we can calculate $\\lambda$:\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\cdot (c \\cdot \\tau_0) = \\frac{26.78}{3.41} \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n        $\\lambda \\approx 7.853 \\cdot (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n    c.  **Apply the Decay Probability Condition**:\n        The decay of particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle travels a distance `L` or more before decaying is given by:\n        $P(L \\ge R) = e^{-R/\\lambda}$\n        where `R` is the detector resolution and `λ` is the mean decay length we just calculated.\n        We are given the condition that at least 30% of decays must be observed:\n        $P(L \\ge R) \\ge 0.30$\n        $e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n    d.  **Solve for the Resolution (R)**:\n        To solve for `R`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $\\ln(e^{-R/\\lambda}) \\ge \\ln(0.30)$\n        $-R/\\lambda \\ge \\ln(0.30)$\n        When we multiply by -1, we must flip the inequality sign:\n        $R/\\lambda \\le -\\ln(0.30)$\n        $R \\le -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n        Let's calculate the value of $-\\ln(0.30)$:\n        $-\\ln(0.30) \\approx -(-1.204) \\approx 1.204$\n        So, the condition is:\n        $R \\le 1.204 \\cdot \\lambda$\n        $R \\le 1.204 \\cdot (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m})$\n        $R \\le 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Final Code Check and Interpretation:**\n    The condition is that the resolution `R` must be less than or equal to $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. We use the provided Python code output for a more precise value.\n\nThe code performed the following calculation:\n`R_max = - (sqrt(E^2 - m0^2) / m0) * c * tau0 * ln(prob)`\nThe output was `2.268e-06`.\n\nThis means the required resolution `R` must be $R \\le 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m: This resolution is much smaller than the threshold. It would work.\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m: This resolution is too large. It would not work.\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m: This resolution is smaller than the threshold ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\le 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$). It would work.\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m: This resolution is too large. It would not work.\n\nBoth options A and C are technically correct solutions. However, the question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". This usually refers to the largest possible resolution (least stringent requirement) that still satisfies the condition. Among the viable options, option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is the closest to the calculated upper limit and represents the minimum performance standard needed. Therefore, C is the best answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
