    "Here's a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3, followed by an analysis of its molecular symmetry.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the nitration of toluene, an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The nitrating agent is the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), generated in situ from nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reactant:** Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃) has a methyl group (-CH₃) on a benzene ring. The methyl group is an ortho, para-directing activator.\n*   **Product 1:** Nitration of toluene yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the para-isomer is the major product. In multi-step synthesis problems, we typically assume the major product is carried to the next step.\n    *   **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction. Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene. The reagent is manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in the presence of sulfuric acid.\n*   **Analysis:** Strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ would oxidize the benzylic methyl group (-CH₃) all the way to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). However, MnO₂ is a milder oxidizing agent often used to oxidize benzylic alcohols to aldehydes. Its use here, especially in the context of the subsequent reaction, strongly suggests a controlled oxidation that stops at the aldehyde stage. Oxidation of p-nitrotoluene with MnO₂ can yield p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group of p-nitrotoluene is oxidized to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n    *   **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde.**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed condensation reaction between an aldehyde (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone (acetone). This specific type of reaction is known as the **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The base (NaOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of acetone (CH₃COCH₃) to form an enolate ion (⁻CH₂COCH₃), which is a nucleophile.\n    2.  The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    3.  An aldol addition intermediate is formed, which then readily dehydrates (loses a water molecule) under the reaction conditions. This dehydration is driven by the formation of a highly conjugated final product.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The structure is 4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Due to steric hindrance, the more stable trans (E) isomer is formed.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3**\n\nNow we must determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) for the final product, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **Structure Visualization:** The molecule consists of a p-nitrophenyl group, a trans-double bond linker, and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). The entire conjugated system (from the NO₂ group through the ring and the ene-one system) prefers a planar conformation to maximize π-orbital overlap.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** Let's assume the heavy atoms of the conjugated system lie in a single plane.\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n    *   **Proper Rotation Axis (Cₙ, n>1):** There is no rotational axis. The two ends of the molecule are different (a p-nitrophenyl group vs. an acetyl group), so no C₂ axis can exist along the main axis of the molecule or perpendicular to it.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule is not centrosymmetric. The two ends are different.\n    *   **Mirror Plane (σ):** Consider the plane that contains the planar conjugated backbone (the nitro group, the benzene ring, the -CH=CH-C=O system). For this plane to be a mirror plane for the *entire* molecule, the methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the carbonyl must also be symmetric with respect to this plane. The methyl group is tetrahedral and rotates freely. It can adopt a conformation where one of its C-H bonds lies within this plane. In this conformation, the other two hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically, one above and one below the plane. Therefore, this molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry (σ) for the whole molecule.\n    *   **Improper Rotation Axis (Sₙ):** Since there are no Cₙ (n>1) axes, there are no Sₙ (n>1) axes. S₁ is equivalent to a mirror plane (σ), and S₂ is equivalent to a center of inversion (i).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only symmetry elements present in the molecule are the identity (E) and a single mirror plane (σ). A point group defined by these two elements is **Cₛ**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) C₃\nB) Cₛ\nC) D₂ₕ\nD) C₂ₕ\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is Cₛ.\n\n<<<B>>>"
