    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product (4).**\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid is brominated at the alpha-carbon (the methyl group).\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n*   **Reaction 3: 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbon atom bonded to bromine and displacing the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n*   **Reaction 4: 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), Sodium Hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is a multi-step synthesis involving deprotonation and alkylation, leading to an intramolecular cyclization known as the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group are acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by both the nitrile (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups.\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]Na+ + H2`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The intermediate still has one acidic α-proton. The \"excess\" NaH deprotonates this carbon again.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]Na+ + H2`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a six-membered ring, as this is a favorable ring size.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the final product (4) to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is:\n\n      CN\n      |\n      C -- COO-CH2-CH3\n     / \\\n  H2C--CH2\n  |    |\n  H2C--CH2\n   \\  /\n    CH2\n\nWe need to identify all chemically non-equivalent sets of hydrogen atoms. This is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the cyano group (-CN), the quaternary carbon (C1 of the ring), the ester group (-COOEt), and the C4 carbon of the ring.\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes the two sides of the ring equivalent. Therefore:\n        *   Carbon C2 is equivalent to C6.\n        *   Carbon C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n*   **Counting the Hydrogen Signals:** The question asks for the number of *distinct* hydrogen signals, which means we must count chemically non-equivalent protons separately. Diastereotopic protons are chemically distinct and give separate signals.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will appear as one signal (a triplet). (Signal 1)\n    *   **-CH2-:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic because the molecule is achiral. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a non-chiral solvent. They will appear as one signal (a quartet). (Signal 2)\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** We must consider the axial and equatorial positions for the protons on each CH2 group in the ring's chair conformation. Even with rapid ring flipping, axial and equatorial protons in substituted cyclohexanes have different chemical shifts.\n    *   **C2 and C6:** These carbons are equivalent by symmetry. On each carbon, there are two diastereotopic protons (one axial, one equatorial). The axial proton on C2 is equivalent to the axial proton on C6. The equatorial proton on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This results in two distinct signals from these four protons. (Signal 3 and Signal 4)\n    *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, these carbons are equivalent. The axial protons on C3 and C5 are equivalent, and the equatorial protons on C3 and C5 are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives two more distinct signals. (Signal 5 and Signal 6)\n    *   **C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic because they have a different spatial relationship to the substituents at C1. They cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation. Thus, they are chemically distinct and will produce two signals. (Signal 7 and Signal 8)\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Ethyl group: 2 signals\n    *   C2/C6 protons: 2 signals\n    *   C3/C5 protons: 2 signals\n    *   C4 protons: 2 signals\n    *   Total = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8** distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
