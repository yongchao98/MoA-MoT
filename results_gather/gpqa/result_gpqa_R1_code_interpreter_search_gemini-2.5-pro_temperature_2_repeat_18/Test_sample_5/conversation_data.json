    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe problem provides the potential in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often beneficial to convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\nx = r * cos(θ)\ny = r * sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (r * cos(θ))^2\nSince x = r * cos(θ), the second term becomes (3/2) * k * x^2.\n\nSo, the potential in Cartesian coordinates is:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * x^2\n\nNow, group the terms with x^2 and y^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n**2. Recognize the Separable Potential**\n\nThe potential V(x, y) is a sum of two independent potentials:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\nThis form represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be solved by separating the variables. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from the x and y dimensions:\nE = E_x + E_y\n\n**3. Find the Energy Spectrum for Each Dimension**\n\nThe energy levels for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with potential V(q) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * q^2 are given by:\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * ħ * ω\n\nWe need to find the angular frequency (ω) for both the x and y dimensions.\n\n**a) For the x-direction:**\nV_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\nComparing this to the standard form V_x(x) = 1/2 * m * ω_x^2 * x^2, we get:\n1/2 * m * ω_x^2 = 2 * k\nm * ω_x^2 = 4 * k\nω_x^2 = 4k / m\nω_x = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-direction are:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**b) For the y-direction:**\nV_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\nComparing this to the standard form V_y(y) = 1/2 * m * ω_y^2 * y^2, we get:\n1/2 * m * ω_y^2 = 1/2 * k\nm * ω_y^2 = k\nω_y^2 = k / m\nω_y = sqrt(k / m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-direction are:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = [(n_x + 1/2) * ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m)] + [(n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)]\n\nNow, factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\nE = [2 * (n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = [2*n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2*n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
