    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f$, also given as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for this reaction is:\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nIn our case, we start with the product, the $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ complex, and want to find how much of it dissociates back into reactants. The dissociation is the reverse reaction:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Set up an ICE Table**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms.\n\n| Species            | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$    | 0.02                      | -x         | 0.02 - x                      |\n| $Ca^{2+}$          | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$        | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n\nAccording to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, for every mole of the complex that dissociates, one mole of $Ca^{2+}$ and one mole of $EDTA^{4-}$ are formed.\n\n**3. Apply the Equilibrium Constant Expression**\n\nNow, we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n\n$K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n**4. Simplify and Solve for x**\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f$) is extremely large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), which indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n\nWe can make a simplifying assumption:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe expression becomes:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$:\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nTo find x, we take the square root of both sides:\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x = 2 \\times \\sqrt{10^{-13}}$\n$x = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5}$\n$x = 2 \\times 3.162 \\times 10^{-7}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\n**5. Verify the Assumption and Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated value $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M is indeed much smaller than 0.02 M, so our simplifying assumption was valid.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 6.3x10^-7 M\nB) 1.0x10^-2 M\nC) 5.0x10^-3 M\nD) 2.0x10^-2 M\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option A.\n\nWe can also use a small python script to perform the calculation without the approximation (solving the full quadratic equation), which will give a more precise result.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\nKf = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# The equilibrium expression is Kf = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n# This rearranges to the quadratic equation: Kf*x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0\n# We solve for x using the quadratic formula: x = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n# where a=Kf, b=1, c=-0.02.\n# Since x (concentration) must be positive, we use the positive root.\n\na = Kf\nb = 1\nc = -initial_complex_conc\n\nx = (-b + math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)\n\n# Also calculating with the approximation for comparison\nx_approx = math.sqrt(initial_complex_conc / Kf)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of Ca2+ ions is: {x:.2e} M\")\nprint(f\"The concentration using the approximation is: {x_approx:.2e} M\")\n```\n> The concentration of Ca2+ ions is: 6.32e-07 M\n> The concentration using the approximation is: 6.32e-07 M\n\nThe script confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical process:** The problem describes a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. We need to find the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$). This means we need to consider the dissociation of the complex.\n\n2.  **Write the equilibrium reaction:** The formation of the complex is $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. The dissociation, which is the reaction we are interested in, is the reverse:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Write the equilibrium constant expression:** The given constant is the *formation constant*, $K_{f}$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):** We start with 0.02 M of the complex, and it dissociates. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms at equilibrium. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of $EDTA^{4-}$ formed will also be 'x', and the concentration of the complex that dissociates will be 'x'.\n\n| Species            | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :----------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n5.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the Kf expression:**\n    $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Simplify and solve:** The formation constant $K_f$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$). This means the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction (i.e., very little of the complex will dissociate). Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the assumption that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The expression simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n7.  **Calculate x:**\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n8.  **Verify the assumption and compare with options:**\n    The calculated value $x = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M is indeed much smaller than 0.02 M, so our assumption was valid.\n    The calculated concentration, $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, matches option A.\n\n9.  **Final Confirmation from Code Output:** The python code solved the full quadratic equation $K_f x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0$ and gave the result $x = 6.32e-07$ M. It also calculated the result using the approximation, which yielded the same value. This confirms the manual calculation.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n<<<A>>>"
