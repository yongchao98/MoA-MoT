    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:**\n    The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential energy for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. \"Isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, i.e., it depends only on the radial distance $r$. The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) of the third excited state.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved most easily by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The Hamiltonian is:\n    $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$\n\n    This can be separated into three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 i^2$ for $i = x, y, z$.\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n\n    For the 3D isotropic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies from each dimension:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n3.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    We can find the energies of the different states by assigning values to $N$.\n    *   **Ground State:** $N = 0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $N = 1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $N = 2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $N = 3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Find the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that correspond to the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ can be chosen such that their sum is $N=3$.\n\n    We can list the combinations:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3)  (3 combinations)\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n        (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2)  (6 combinations)\n    *   All quantum numbers are 1:\n        (1, 1, 1)  (1 combination)\n\n    The total number of combinations is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy level $E_3$. The degeneracy is 10.\n\n    Alternatively, the degeneracy $g_N$ of the N-th energy level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n    $g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $N=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n\n    A) (9/2) ħω, 10\n    B) (9/2) ħω, 3\n    C) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 3\n    D) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 10\n\n    Option A perfectly matches our derived values. The energy expressions in options C and D are incorrect for a harmonic oscillator potential; they resemble the form for a particle in a spherical box.\n\n<<<A>>>"
