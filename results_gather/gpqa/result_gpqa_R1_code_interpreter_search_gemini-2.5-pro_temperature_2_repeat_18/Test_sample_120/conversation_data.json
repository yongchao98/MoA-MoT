    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core structure \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" represents a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons. The numbering convention for bicyclic systems designates these bridgehead carbons as C1 and C6. So, we have a cyclohexene oxide derivative.\n    *   The molecule has methyl substituents at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. This reagent is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between an epoxide and an organocuprate is a nucleophilic ring-opening of the epoxide. The problem provides a key rule for this reaction: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\" This is a classic Sₙ2-type reaction.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure of the Starting Material\n\nLet's establish the 3D structure of the epoxide based on its name. We can draw the cyclohexane ring in a planar projection with wedges and dashes to represent the stereochemistry. We'll assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing up (wedged) for clarity.\n\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by C1, C6, and the oxygen atom (O7).\n*   **Stereocenter C1 (must be R):** It is bonded to O(1), C6(2), C2(3), and a methyl group(4). With the oxygen wedged, for the configuration to be R, the methyl group must be dashed (pointing down, trans to the epoxide).\n*   **Stereocenter C6 (must be S):** It is bonded to O(1), C1(2), C5(3), and H(4). With the oxygen wedged, for the configuration to be S, the hydrogen atom must be dashed (pointing down, trans to the epoxide).\n*   **Stereocenter C3 (must be R):** It is bonded to C4(1), C2(2), a methyl group(3), and H(4). To achieve R configuration, if the H is dashed, the methyl group must be wedged (pointing up).\n*   **Stereocenter C4 (must be R):** It is bonded to C5(1), C3(2), a methyl group(3), and H(4). To achieve R configuration, if the H is wedged, the methyl group must be dashed (pointing down).\n\nSo, the relative stereochemistry of the starting material is:\n*   Epoxide oxygen: up (wedged)\n*   C1-Methyl: down (dashed)\n*   C3-Methyl: up (wedged)\n*   C4-Methyl: down (dashed)\n\n### 3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)\n\nThe reaction rule states that the attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Carbon C1:** is a quaternary carbon, bonded to C2, C6, an oxygen, and a methyl group.\n*   **Carbon C6:** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to C1, C5, an oxygen, and a hydrogen atom.\n\nThe tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\n\nThe attack is an Sₙ2 reaction, which proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n*   The attack is on C6.\n*   The C6-O bond of the epoxide is \"up\" (wedged).\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the opposite face, i.e., from \"down\". The new methyl group at C6 will be dashed.\n*   The original H atom at C6, which was dashed (\"down\"), will be pushed \"up\" and become wedged. The configuration at C6 inverts from S to R.\n*   Simultaneously, the C1-O bond of the epoxide breaks, with the oxygen remaining bonded to C1. After an acidic or aqueous workup step, this oxygen is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Since the C1-O bond was \"up\" (wedged), the resulting -OH group will also be \"up\" (wedged).\n*   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations remain unchanged.\n\n### 5. Name the Product and Assign Stereochemistry\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is assigned locant 1.\n*   The original C1, now bearing the OH group, becomes the new **C1**.\n*   We number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering clockwise makes the original C6 the new **C2**. This gives substituents at positions 1(Me), 2(Me), 4, and 5. Numbering counter-clockwise would give substituents at 1, 3, 4, 6. The first choice (1,2,4,5) is lower.\n*   So the product name skeleton is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D.\n\nNow, let's assign the R/S configuration to each stereocenter in the product using the new numbering:\n*   **New C1 (old C1):** Has an OH(w) and Me(d). Priorities are OH > C2 > C6 > Me. With Me(#4) being dashed, the clockwise path of OH → C2 → C6 gives a **1R** configuration.\n*   **New C2 (old C6):** Has a new Me(d) and an H(w). The configuration inverted from the original 6S. It is now **2R**. We can also determine this directly: Priorities are C1 > C3 > Me > H. With H(#4) being wedged, the counter-clockwise path of C1 → C3 → Me means the configuration is R (reversed from S). So, **2R**.\n*   **New C4 (old C4):** Has a Me(d) and an H(w). Its original configuration was 4R, and it remains unchanged relative to its neighbours, but we re-evaluate with the new numbering scheme. Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. With H(#4) being wedged, the counter-clockwise path C5 → C3 → Me indicates an R configuration (reversed from S). So, **4R**.\n*   **New C5 (old C3):** Has a Me(w) and an H(d). Its original configuration was 3R. We re-evaluate. Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. With H(#4) being dashed, the clockwise path C4 → C6 → Me indicates an **5R** configuration.\n\nSo the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nComparing our deduced product name and stereochemistry with the given options:\n*   A) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur result, (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
