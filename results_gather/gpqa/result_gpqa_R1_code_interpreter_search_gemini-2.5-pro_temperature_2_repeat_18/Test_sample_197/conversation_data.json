    "This problem requires us to calculate the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify all cobalt-containing species:** In the solution, cobalt exists as the free hydrated ion `Co²⁺` and a series of complexes with thiocyanate (`SCN⁻`): `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):** The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (`βₙ`).\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n4.  **Express `c(Co)` in terms of `[Co²⁺]` and `[SCN⁻]`:** By substituting the expressions from step 3 into the equation from step 2, we can factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Define the fraction of the target complex:** The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which we'll call `α₂`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    `α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\n6.  **Derive the formula for `α₂`:** Substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)₂]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n    Notice that the fraction of each species depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, not on the total cobalt concentration.\n\n7.  **Approximate the free ligand concentration:** The total thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is 10 times the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). Since the ligand is in relative excess, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` as being equal to its total concentration, 0.1 M. This is a common simplification in such problems.\n\n8.  **Calculate the value:** Now we plug in the given values into the formula for `α₂`:\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40`\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n\nLet's calculate the terms for the denominator first:\n    *   Term 0: `1`\n    *   Term 1: `β₁ * [SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term 2: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Term 3: `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   Term 4: `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nThe denominator (sum S) is: `S = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\nThe numerator is `Term 2 = 0.4`.\n\nNow, calculate `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo find the percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches option B. The calculation can be verified with the following Python code.\n```python\n# Given stability constants and concentrations\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nconc_SCN = 0.1  # M\n\n# The fraction of a species [Co(SCN)n] (alpha_n) is given by:\n# alpha_n = (beta_n * [SCN-]^n) / S\n# where S is the sum of all terms: S = 1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + ...\n\n# Let L be the concentration of the free ligand SCN-\nL = conc_SCN\n\n# Calculate the denominator, S\n# Note: beta_0 is defined as 1\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * L**1\nterm2 = beta2 * L**2\nterm3 = beta3 * L**3\nterm4 = beta4 * L**4\nS = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# We want the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)2].\n# This corresponds to alpha_2.\n# The numerator is term2.\nnumerator = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha_2 = numerator / S\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we first need to find the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n1.  **Identify all cobalt species:** In the solution, cobalt(II) can exist as the free aquated ion, `Co²⁺`, and various thiocyanato complexes: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:**\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n3.  **Use stability constants (`β`):** The concentration of each complex is related to the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` and the free thiocyanate ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` by the overall stability constants `βₙ`:\n    `[Co(SCN)ₙ] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n    (Where `β₀` is defined as 1, for the free `Co²⁺` ion).\n\n4.  **Express `c(Co)` in terms of `[Co²⁺]`:**\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factoring out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Determine the fraction (`α₂`) of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex:** The fraction `α₂` is the ratio of the concentration of the desired complex to the total cobalt concentration.\n    `α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substituting the expressions from steps 3 and 4:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the value:** We are given:\n    *   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1` M (since the ligand is in large excess compared to the metal ion, we can approximate the free ligand concentration by its total concentration).\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40`\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n\n    Let's calculate the denominator (let's call it `S`):\n    *   Term `β₀`: `1`\n    *   Term `β₁`: `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    *   Term `β₂`: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Term `β₃`: `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   Term `β₄`: `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n    `S = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    The numerator is the term corresponding to `[Co(SCN)₂]`, which is `0.4`.\n\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n7.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    Percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]` = `α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`.\n\nThis result matches option B.
