    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Problem:** The user is asking for the electromagnetic potentials (scalar potential V and vector potential **A**) generated by a moving point charge `q`. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Recall the Concept of Retarded Time:** The key challenge with moving charges is that the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. The field experienced at a point **r** at time `t` was not generated by the charge at its position at that same time `t`. Instead, it was generated at an earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**. The signal emitted at `tr` from the charge's position **s**(`tr`) has just enough time to travel the distance to the observation point **r** to arrive exactly at time `t`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Retarded Time Condition:**\n    *   Let **s**(`tr`) be the position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   Let **r** be the position of the observer (the field point).\n    *   The distance the signal travels is `|**r** - **s**(tr)|`. The question defines the vector from the source to the observer as **d**, so `**d** = **r** - **s**(tr)` and its magnitude is `d = |**d**|`.\n    *   The time it takes for the signal to travel this distance is `d/c`.\n    *   Therefore, the relationship between the observation time `t` and the retarded time `tr` is:\n        `t - tr = d / c`  or `c(t - tr) = d`\n\n4.  **Start with the General Formulas for Potentials:**\n    The general solutions to Maxwell's equations for the potentials, given a charge distribution `ρ` and current density **J**, are the retarded potentials:\n    `V(**r**, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(**r'**, tr) / |**r** - **r'**|] d³r'`\n    `**A**(**r**, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [**J**(**r'**, tr) / |**r** - **r'**|] d³r'`\n    where `tr = t - |**r** - **r'**|/c`.\n\n5.  **Adapt for a Moving Point Charge:**\n    For a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory **s**(`t`), the charge density `ρ` and current density **J** can be represented using Dirac delta functions:\n    `ρ(**r'**, t) = q * δ³(**r'** - **s**(t))`\n    `**J**(**r'**, t) = q * **v**(t) * δ³(**r'** - **s**(t))`, where `**v**(t)` is the charge's velocity.\n\n    Substituting these into the integral formulas is not straightforward because the `δ` function's argument `t` is different from the retarded time `tr` inside the integrand. A careful evaluation of the integral `∫...d³r'` requires changing the integration variable to account for the retardation. The result of this integration (a standard derivation in E&M textbooks) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n6.  **State the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:**\n    The result of the integration is:\n    `V(**r**, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - **d** · **v** / c)]`\n    `**A**(**r**, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q**v** / (d - **d** · **v** / c)]`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `q` is the charge.\n    *   **d** is the vector from the charge's retarded position **s**(`tr`) to the observation point **r**.\n    *   `d` is the magnitude of **d**.\n    *   **v** is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `ε₀` and `μ₀` are the permittivity and permeability of free space.\n\n7.  **Manipulate the Expressions to Match the Options:**\n    The denominator term `(d - **d** · **v** / c)` is common. Let's rewrite it by finding a common denominator `c`:\n    `d - **d** · **v** / c = (dc - **d** · **v**) / c`\n\n    Now substitute this back into the formulas for V and **A**:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        `V(**r**, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((dc - **d** · **v**) / c)]`\n        `V(**r**, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - **d** · **v**))`\n\n    *   For the vector potential **A**:\n        `**A**(**r**, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q**v** / ((dc - **d** · **v**) / c)]`\n        `**A**(**r**, t) = μ₀qc**v** / (4π (dc - **d** · **v**))`\n\n8.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's check each option against our derived formulas.\n\n    *   **A)** `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀ r)`, `A(r,t) = v/c² V(r,t)`\n        *   Incorrect. This is the potential for a static charge (or the quasi-static approximation), not a moving charge with retardation effects. `r` is the instantaneous distance, not the retarded distance `d`.\n\n    *   **B)** `V(r,t) = qc/(4πε₀ (d c + d.v))`, `A(r,t) = μ qc v/(4π (d c + d.v))`\n        *   Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is `+`, but it should be `-`. The term `-**d** · **v**` corrects for the Doppler-like effect on the potential.\n\n    *   **C)** `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀ r)`, `A(r,t) = v²/c² V(r,t)`\n        *   Incorrect. Same reason as A for V. The expression for **A** is also incorrect; it involves `v²` (a scalar), but **A** must be a vector.\n\n    *   **D)** `V(r,t) = qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d.v))`, `A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v/(4π (d c - d.v))`\n        *   **This matches our derived expression for V exactly.**\n        *   **This matches our derived expression for A exactly.**\n\n9.  **Final Confirmation (Relationship between A and V):**\n    It's a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that `**A**(**r**, t) = (**v** / c²) * V(**r**, t)`. Let's verify this for the expressions in option D.\n    `(**v** / c²) * V = (**v** / c²) * [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - **d** · **v**))]`\n    Using the identity `c² = 1 / (μ₀ε₀)`, we can replace `1 / (c²ε₀)` with `μ₀`:\n    `(**v** / c²) * V = **v** * [q(μ₀ε₀) / (4πε₀ (dc - **d** · **v**))] * c`\n    `= μ₀qc**v** / (4π (dc - **d** · **v**))`\n    This is exactly the expression for **A** in option D. Thus, the relationship is consistent, and the individual formulas are correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
