    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Principle of Conservation of Energy\n\nThe problem involves a conservative force (Hook's law), so the total energy of the system is conserved. In relativistic mechanics, the total energy ($E$) of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ under a potential $U(x)$ is given by:\n$E = K + E_0 + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\nwhere:\n*   $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$ is the relativistic kinetic energy.\n*   $E_0 = mc^2$ is the rest energy.\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ is the potential energy of the spring.\n\nThe total energy $E$ remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n### 2. Identify Key Points in the Oscillation\n\nWe need to relate the state of the oscillator at its maximum displacement to its state at the equilibrium position.\n\n*   **At maximum displacement (amplitude):**\n    *   The position is $x = A$.\n    *   The mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    *   Since $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy at this point ($E_1$) is:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma mc^2 + U(A) = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n*   **At the equilibrium position:**\n    *   The position is $x = 0$.\n    *   The speed is maximum: $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The total energy at this point ($E_2$) is:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + U(0) = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n### 3. Apply Energy Conservation\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at both points must be equal:\n$E_1 = E_2$\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\nAn alternative way to think about this is using the work-energy theorem. The work done by the spring force when the mass moves from $x=A$ to $x=0$ is equal to the change in its kinetic energy.\nWork done by spring $W = \\int_A^0 F dx = \\int_A^0 (-kx) dx = [-\\frac{1}{2}kx^2]_A^0 = 0 - (-\\frac{1}{2}kA^2) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\nChange in kinetic energy $\\Delta K = K_{final} - K_{initial} = K(v_{max}) - K(0)$.\n$K(v_{max}) = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n$K(0) = (\\gamma(v=0)-1)mc^2 = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\nSo, $\\Delta K = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\nEquating work and change in kinetic energy:\n$\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\nThis equation can be rearranged to $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$, which is the same as the energy conservation equation.\n\n### 4. Solve for $v_{max}$\n\nLet's proceed from the equation derived from energy conservation:\n$\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\nDivide the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n$\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nNow, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nTo solve for $v_{max}$, we need to isolate it. First, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n$1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nRearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nFinally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n$v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} \\right)$\n$v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\n\nNow, compare this result with the given choices:\n\nA) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (This is the classical, non-relativistic result).\nB) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ (Incorrect structure).\nC) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ (This matches our derived result).\nD) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ (Dimensionally incorrect and wrong structure).\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
