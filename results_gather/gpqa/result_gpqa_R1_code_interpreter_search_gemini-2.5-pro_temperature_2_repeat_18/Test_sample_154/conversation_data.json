    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the operator $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a specific quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$ is given by the standard deviation, calculated using the formula:\n    $(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\n    where $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the expectation value in the given state $|\\psi\\rangle$. Specifically, $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$.\n\n    For our problem, the formula is:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The matrix for the operator $P_z$:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    *   The state vector (ket) of the system, $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    *   The corresponding bra vector, $\\langle \\psi |$, is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $\\langle \\psi | = (|\\psi\\rangle)^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$ (Since all components are real, it's just the transpose).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    First, we calculate the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar(-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, we compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2)$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n    $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Next, we calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2(-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, we compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2)$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    Now, substitute the calculated expectation values back into the uncertainty formula:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n    Take the square root to find the uncertainty:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated uncertainty $\\Delta P_z = \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$ matches option D.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a Python script to perform the matrix calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set hbar = 1 for numerical calculation, and re-insert it in the final result.\nhbar = 1\n\n# Define the matrix for the operator Pz\nPz = np.array([\n    [hbar, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, -hbar]\n])\n\n# Define the state vector psi\npsi = np.array([\n    [-1/2],\n    [1/np.sqrt(2)],\n    [-1/2]\n])\n\n# Define the bra vector psi_dagger (conjugate transpose of psi)\npsi_dagger = psi.T.conj()\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz: <Pz> = <psi|Pz|psi>\nexp_Pz = (psi_dagger @ Pz @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the matrix for Pz^2\nPz_squared_matrix = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz^2: <Pz^2> = <psi|Pz^2|psi>\nexp_Pz_squared = (psi_dagger @ Pz_squared_matrix @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the variance (Delta Pz)^2\nvariance_Pz = exp_Pz_squared -
