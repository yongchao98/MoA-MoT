    "E1. **Analyze the first part of the statement: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"**\n\n*   **Thermodynamic strength** of an oxidant is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° value means a stronger oxidant.\n*   We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in acidic and basic solutions.\n    *   **In acidic solution**, the half-reaction is:\n        O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n    *   **In basic solution**, the half-reaction is:\n        O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n*   Comparing the values, +1.23 V (acidic) is significantly higher than +0.40 V (basic).\n*   This means that oxygen is a **stronger** oxidant in acidic solution and a **weaker** oxidant in basic solution.\n*   Therefore, the first blank should be \"weaker\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the second part of the statement: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"**\n\n*   **Kinetics** refers to the rate of reaction. A reaction can be thermodynamically favorable (like the reduction of O₂) but kinetically slow.\n*   The reduction of diatomic oxygen (O₂) to water (H₂O) or hydroxide (OH⁻) is a four-electron process. Multi-electron transfers are often kinetically slow because they require breaking a strong double bond (O=O) and proceed through several high-energy intermediate steps.\n*   This kinetic slowness, or high activation energy, is observed in both acidic and basic solutions. It's why many substances that should theoretically be oxidized by air (like a steel car) don't combust spontaneously. The reaction requires a catalyst or high temperature to proceed at a noticeable rate.\n*   Thus, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in general, and this holds true in acidic solutions.\n*   Therefore, the second blank should be \"slower\".\n\n3.  **Combine the findings.**\n\n*   The first blank is \"weaker\".\n*   The second blank is \"slower\".\n*   This corresponds to the combination: **weaker - slower**.\n\nFinal check: The complete statement would be \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts slower in acidic solutions.\" This is consistent with the principles of electrochemistry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
