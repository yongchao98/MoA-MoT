    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Energy Spectrum Shape (Continuous vs. Discrete)\n\nThe nature of a particle's energy spectrum in a decay depends on the number of particles in the final state.\n\n*   **Two-Body Decay:** In a decay where one particle at rest decays into two final particles (e.g., A -> B + C), the laws of conservation of energy and momentum completely determine the energies of the outgoing particles. Each particle B and C will have a specific, fixed energy. This results in a **discrete** energy spectrum (a sharp peak or \"line\" at that specific energy).\n\n*   **Multi-Body Decay (More than two particles):** In a decay with three or more particles in the final state (e.g., A -> B + C + D), the available energy (the Q-value of the decay) is shared among the final particles. This energy can be partitioned in a continuous range of possibilities, while still conserving total momentum. Consequently, the energy spectrum of any one of the final particles will be **continuous**, ranging from zero up to some maximum value.\n\nLet's apply this to the two scenarios:\n\n*   **Original Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n    The final state consists of six particles (two B, two E, two V). This is a multi-body decay. As stated in the problem, the energy spectrum of the E particles is continuous.\n\n*   **Exotic Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`\n    The final state consists of five particles (two B, two E, one M). This is also a multi-body decay. Since there are still more than two particles in the final state sharing the decay energy, the energy spectrum of the E particles will **remain continuous**. The exact distribution (the \"shape\") will be different due to the different kinematics and number of particles (a different \"phase space\"), but it will not become discrete.\n\nThis reasoning eliminates options B and C, which state the spectrum becomes discrete.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Endpoint of the Energy Spectrum\n\nThe endpoint of the energy spectrum corresponds to the maximum possible energy the E particles can have. This maximum energy is limited by the total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value.\n\nThe Q-value is the difference between the total rest energy of the initial particles and the total rest energy of the final particles. This difference is converted into the kinetic energy of the final particles.\n\n`Q-value = (Mass_initial - Mass_final) * c^2`\n\nLet's calculate and compare the Q-values for both decays.\n\n*   **Initial State (both scenarios):** The total initial rest energy is `E_initial = (2 * m_A) * c^2`.\n\n*   **Final State (Original Decay):** The total final rest energy is `E_final_1 = (2*m_B + 2*m_E + 2*m_V) * c^2`.\n    The energy released is `Q_1 = E_initial - E_final_1 = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V) * c^2`.\n\n*   **Final State (Exotic Decay):** The total final rest energy is `E_final_2 = (2*m_B + 2*m_E + m_M) * c^2`.\n    We are told that particle M is massless, so `m_M = 0`.\n    `E_final_2 = (2*m_B + 2*m_E) * c^2`.\n    The energy released is `Q_2 = E_initial - E_final_2 = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E) * c^2`.\n\nNow, let's compare the energy released in the two cases:\n`Q_2 - Q_1 = [(2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E) * c^2] - [(2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V) * c^2]`\n`Q_2 - Q_1 = (2 * m_V) * c^2`\n\nSince V is a \"light particle\", it has a positive rest mass (`m_V > 0`). Therefore, `Q_2 > Q_1`.\n\nThe exotic decay releases more total energy than the original decay. This extra energy is available to be distributed as kinetic energy among the final particles.\n\nThe endpoint of the E particle spectrum (`Q` in the problem statement) represents the maximum possible total energy for the two E particles. This occurs when the other particles carry away the minimum possible energy. Since the total available kinetic energy (`Q-value`) is higher in the exotic decay, the maximum possible energy for the E particles must also be higher. Therefore, the endpoint of the spectrum **increases**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.  The spectrum remains **continuous** because the final state is still a multi-body system.\n2.  The endpoint of the spectrum **increases** because replacing two massive V particles with one massless M particle reduces the total final rest mass, thus increasing the total energy released in the decay.\n\nCombining these two points leads to the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
