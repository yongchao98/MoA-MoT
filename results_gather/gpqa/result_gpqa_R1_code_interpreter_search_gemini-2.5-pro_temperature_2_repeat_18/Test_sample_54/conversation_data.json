    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Carbon Skeleton**\n\n*   First, let's sum the number of protons (the integration value) from the NMR data: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n*   Now, let's determine the number of protons for each possible compound:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2)**: The chemical formula is C5H8O2. The number of hydrogens is 8. This matches the data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2)**: The chemical formula is C6H10O2. The number of hydrogens is 10. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options A) Cis-butenyl acetate and D) Trans-butenyl acetate. We only need to decide between Cis-propenyl acetate (B) and Trans-propenyl acetate (C).\n\n**2. Analyze the Splitting Pattern and Coupling Constants**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between cis and trans isomers lies in the coupling constant (J value) between the protons on the double bond (vinyl protons).\n\n*   **The Data:** We have a signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**.\n    *   This signal represents a single vinyl proton.\n    *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one other proton.\n    *   The coupling constant is **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry Rule:** The magnitude of the vicinal coupling constant (3JHH) for protons on a double bond is stereospecific:\n    *   **Trans protons:** Typically have a large coupling constant, J_trans ≈ 12-18 Hz.\n    *   **Cis protons:** Typically have a smaller coupling constant, J_cis ≈ 6-12 Hz.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The observed coupling constant of 16.0 Hz falls squarely in the range for a **trans** double bond. This strongly indicates the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Assign All Signals to the Trans-propenyl acetate Structure**\n\nLet's verify that all signals in the spectrum match the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**Structure: Trans-propenyl acetate**\n```\n      H(b)\n     /\nCH3(d)-C   = C - O - C(=O) - CH3(c)\n       \\   /\n        H(a)\n```\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This corresponds to proton **H(a)**. It is on the same carbon as the electron-withdrawing acetate group (-OAc), which shifts it far downfield. It is coupled only to H(b), giving a doublet with a large (trans) J value of 16.0 Hz. This assignment is a perfect match.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to proton **H(b)**. It is coupled to H(a) (which splits it into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group CH3(d) (which splits it into a quartet). The resulting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This is also a perfect match.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate, **CH3(c)**. These protons have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a singlet. The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of an acetate methyl. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the methyl group on the double bond, **CH3(d)**. It is coupled to the single adjacent proton H(b), splitting its signal into a doublet. This is a perfect match.\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The structure of Cis-propenyl acetate is ruled out primarily by the large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz.\n\n<<<C>>>"
