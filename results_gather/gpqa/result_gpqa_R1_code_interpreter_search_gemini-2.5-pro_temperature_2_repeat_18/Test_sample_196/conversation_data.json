    "**1. Analysis of the IR and NMR data to identify Compound X:**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a very distinctive broad absorption band, which is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carboxylic acid that is part of an aromatic system.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are in the region of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n    *Conclusion from IR:* The data strongly suggest that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, a broad singlet far downfield, is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring. The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons ortho (next to) the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal (7.2 ppm) corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** Now, we determine the structure of the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals.\n        *   **Total Protons:** 1H + 2H + 3H + 3H = 9H. This corresponds to a C₄H₉ (butyl) group.\n        *   **Signal Breakdown:**\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton. Its chemical shift indicates it's a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). This must be a methine (-CH-) group.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons. This indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a CH group). This methyl group is attached to the benzylic methine.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons. This indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons. This must be the methylene group (-CH₂-) situated between the benzylic CH and the terminal CH₃ group.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:**\n        1.  We have a benzylic methine (`Ar-CH-`).\n        2.  A methyl group is attached to it (`Ar-CH(CH₃)-`).\n        3.  The remaining fragment is an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), which must also be attached to the benzylic methine.\n        4.  This forms the complete structure: `Ar-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Compound X is reacted with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups, including carboxylic acids, to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically, it will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   **Starting Material (Compound X):** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Chemical Change:** The -COOH group on the benzene ring is reduced to a -CH₃ group. The sec-butyl group and the benzene ring itself are unaffected.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**3. Matching with Options:**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our deduced final product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This is incorrect; the alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This structure is inconsistent with the NMR data of Compound X.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
