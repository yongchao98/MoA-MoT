    "**Thinking Process:**\n\nThe user wants me to identify two compounds from a given set based on their chemical properties. I need to solve two sub-problems.\n\n**Part A: Identify the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\nThe compounds to consider are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures (tautomers) are in equilibrium and are readily interconvertible. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. A necessary condition for a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on the alpha-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:** Let's assume the user is referring to the most common isomer, 1,4-benzoquinone.\n    *   The chemical formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, and two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4).\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are C-2, C-3, C-5, and C-6.\n    *   Let's examine these alpha-carbons. They are all part of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) within the ring. Each of these carbons is bonded to another carbon via a double bond and a single bond, leaving only one bond for a hydrogen. In the structure of 1,4-benzoquinone, these carbons are bonded to hydrogen atoms. Wait, let me re-check the structure of 1,4-benzoquinone. The formula is C6H4O2. The structure is a cycle: O=C(1)-CH=CH-C(4)(=O)-CH=CH- (closing the ring between C(1) and the last CH).\n    *   Let's check the alpha positions again. The carbons alpha to the C1=O are C2 and C6. The carbons alpha to the C4=O are C3 and C5. Are these carbons bonded to hydrogen? Yes, the carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are sp2 hybridized and each is bonded to one hydrogen atom.\n    *   However, for keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha-carbon is typically sp3 hybridized. Deprotonation of an sp2 carbon is much more difficult than an sp3 carbon. More importantly, tautomerism involves the formation of an enol (a C=C-OH group). If we try to form an enol from benzoquinone, we would have to break the existing conjugated system. The key point here is the absence of an *sp3 hybridized alpha-carbon with a hydrogen*. Keto-enol tautomerism, in its standard form, does not occur. To form the aromatic hydroquinone tautomer would require a reduction (addition of 2H), not just an intramolecular proton shift. Therefore, 1,4-benzoquinone is considered not to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The chemical formula is C₆H₆O₃.\n    *   Its structure is a saturated six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons, situated between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   Each of these alpha-carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning they each have two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   These alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can easily lose an alpha-hydrogen to form an enolate, which can then be protonated on the oxygen to form an enol.\n    *   In fact, it can tautomerize to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. The stability gained from aromaticity makes this tautomerization highly favorable.\n    *   So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione definitely shows tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. The compound labeled (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identify the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\nThe compounds to consider are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's focus on the central carbon atom, C-2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   Let's identify the four groups attached to this carbon:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   All four of these groups are different.\n    *   Therefore, C-2 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not have an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyze dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Let's look for chiral centers. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The two central carbons are sp2 hybridized and part of a double bond.\n    *   Let's check for overall molecular chirality. The molecule is relatively planar. It has a center of inversion (also called a center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Any molecule that possesses a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate will not. The compound labeled (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching these conclusions with the options:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (Incorrect), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Correct)\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (Incorrect), B = dimethyl fumarate (Incorrect)\n*   C) A = benzoquinone (Correct), B = dimethyl fumarate (Incorrect)\n*   D) A = benzoquinone (Correct), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Correct)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
