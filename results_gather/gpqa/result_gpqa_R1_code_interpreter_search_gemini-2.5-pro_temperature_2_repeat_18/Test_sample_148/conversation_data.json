    "*   **Analyze the observations:**\n    1.  **1H NMR:** There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. Their combined integral is 1H. This means there are two different chemical species present in the sample, each containing that proton but in a slightly different chemical environment. The two species are in roughly equal amounts. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the splitting is not due to coupling with adjacent protons.\n    2.  **LC-MS:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude material into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different species that can be separated based on their physical properties (like polarity). The mass spectrometry (MS) shows that both separated species have the *exact same mass*, and this mass corresponds to the expected product molecule.\n\n*   **Evaluate the options based on the observations:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would likely have a different chemical formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data shows both peaks have the mass of the *final product*, which contradicts this explanation.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass. This is consistent with the MS data.\n        *   Because they are not mirror images, diastereoisomers have different physical properties. This means they can be separated by standard chromatographic techniques like LC. This is consistent with the observation of two peaks in the LC trace.\n        *   Diastereomers also have different chemical environments. In an NMR spectrum, the corresponding protons in two different diastereomers will have different chemical shifts. This would result in two separate sets of peaks, explaining the two distinct peaks observed for the alpha-proton.\n        *   The roughly equal integrals (NMR) and intensities (LC) suggest the diastereomers are present in a ~1:1 ratio. This can occur in peptide synthesis through a process called epimerization, where one of the chiral centers of an amino acid inverts its configuration. For example, synthesizing a dipeptide from two L-amino acids might yield the expected L-L peptide along with the D-L diastereomer. This explanation fits all the experimental observations perfectly.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment.\n        *   In a standard NMR experiment (using an achiral solvent), enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical NMR spectra. You would see only one peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   Similarly, on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers co-elute as a single peak.\n        *   Therefore, this explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is a vague term, but any side reaction that involves adding another molecule (\"double coupling\") would almost certainly change the mass of the final product. The MS data shows the expected mass, making this option highly unlikely.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two species with the same mass but different chromatographic and NMR properties is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
