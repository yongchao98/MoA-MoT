    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products of the given Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate (`CH₂(COOMe)₂`) and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOMe`).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH). NaOEt is a strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate has acidic α-protons (pKa ≈ 13) located on the carbon between the two ester groups. The base, NaOEt, deprotonates it to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, `⁻CH(COOMe)₂`. This is the nucleophile.\n\n    `CH₂(COOMe)₂ + NaOEt <=> [⁻CH(COOMe)₂]Na⁺ + EtOH`\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The presence of the electron-withdrawing ester group makes the C=C double bond electrophilic, particularly at the β-carbon.\n\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`\n\n3.  **Mechanism (1,4-Conjugate Addition):** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and then onto the carbonyl oxygen, forming another enolate intermediate. Subsequent protonation by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon yields the final product.\n\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** `⁻CH(COOMe)₂` attacks `p-Tolyl-CH(β)`.\n    *   **Step 2 (Intermediate):** `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂)-CH=C(O⁻)OMe` (enolate) is formed.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The enolate is protonated by EtOH at the α-carbon.\n\n4.  **Final Product (A):** The final structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n\n    *   **Naming the Product:** This is a tricarboxylic acid ester. The most systematic IUPAC name can be complex. However, we can use a common naming convention based on a propane chain. Let's consider the 3-carbon chain connecting the carboxyl groups: `C(malonate)-C(β)-C(α)`.\n        *   C1: The original malonate carbon, `-CH-`, is bonded to two `-COOMe` groups.\n        *   C2: The original β-carbon, `-CH-`, is bonded to a `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   C3: The original α-carbon, `-CH₂-`, is bonded to one `-COOMe` group.\n    *   Numbering this chain from C1 to C3: `(MeOOC)₂-C1H - C2H(p-tolyl) - C3H₂-COOMe`. Wait, this seems wrong. Let's number from the other end.\n    *   Numbering the propane backbone as C1(α)-C2(β)-C3(malonate):\n        *   C1(-CH₂-) is attached to a `-COOMe` group.\n        *   C2(-CH-) is attached to a `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   C3(-CH-) is attached to two `-COOMe` groups.\n    *   In this polycarboxylic acid naming system, the carbons of the `COOH` groups are not part of the main chain. So the main chain is propane. The carboxylate groups are at positions 1, 3, and 3. `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,3,3-tricarboxylate`. This doesn't match the options.\n    *   Let's try numbering the longest chain containing C(malonate), C(beta) and C(alpha): C1(malonate)-C2(beta)-C3(alpha). `C1H(COOMe)₂ - C2H(p-tolyl) - C3H₂COOMe`. If this is named as substituted methyl propanoate, it would be `methyl 2-[bis(methoxycarbonyl)methyl]-3-(p-tolyl)propanoate`.\n    *   Let's analyze the name provided in option A: `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. This name implies a propane chain (C1-C2-C3) with two carboxylate groups at C1 and one at C3. A `p-tolyl` group is at C2. Structure: `(MeOOC)₂C1-C2H(p-tolyl)-C3H₂-COOMe`. This structure can be formed if the Michael donor `CH(COOMe)₂` attacks the β-carbon `CH(p-tolyl)`. Let's assume the hydrogen from malonate is also lost (e.g., through oxidation) which is not supported by the reaction condition.\n    *   Let's re-examine our product structure: `(MeOOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂-COOMe`. Let the chain be C(alpha)-C(beta)-C(malonate), numbering as C1-C2-C3. The substituents are: one COOMe at C1, a p-tolyl at C2, and two COOMe groups at C3. This leads to `...-propane-1,3,3-tricarboxylate`. This is still not matching.\n    *   There must be an unconventional naming or a mistake in the options' names. Let's retrace the connection points which are unambiguous: malonate `C` connects to acrylate `β-C`. Product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂(α)-COOMe`. Comparing `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` with `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate`, the former corresponds to a `1,4` Michael adduct, while the latter would correspond to a `1,2` adduct to the carbonyl group which is incorrect. So, despite the possibly confusing name, `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` represents the correct connectivity for the Michael addition product.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH) as solvent, followed by aqueous acid workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Stork Enamine Synthesis (a variant of Michael Addition).\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nitrogen's lone pair increases the electron density of the double bond, making the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring) nucleophilic.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site. `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n\n3.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt. The C=N⁺ bond is cleaved and converted back into a carbonyl group (C=O), regenerating the ketone. Piperidine is liberated as piperidinium ion.\n\n4.  **Final Product (B):** The result is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with the fragment from the nitrile. The added fragment is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   **Product Structure:** 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   **Naming the Product:** The molecule can be named as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is the 4-carbon nitrile: `C4H₃-C3H-C2H₂-C1N`. At C3, a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group is attached. Therefore, the name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The hydrolysis step ensures the final product is the ketone, not the enol or enamine.\n\n### Reaction C\n\n*   **Reactants:** An unknown compound **C** and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK, `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`).\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition (in reverse).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The substituent at position 2 is a `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reactants:** One reactant is the Michael acceptor, but-3-en-2-one (`CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`). After the reaction, this becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` side chain. The bond is formed at the β-carbon.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C (Michael Donor):** The reaction forms a bond between the donor's nucleophilic carbon and the acceptor's β-carbon.\n    *   In the product, the `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The methylene protons at C2 of this dione are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 5) because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups. The base KOH easily deprotonates it.\n    *   So, reactant **C** must be `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A:** The product is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B:** The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C:** The reactant is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n*   B) A = ..., B = ..., C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (enol tautomer)\n*   C) A = ... 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (wrong adduct), B = ... (enol form), C = ... (enol form)\n*   D) A = ... 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (wrong adduct), B = ... (enol form), C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOption A correctly identifies all three species according to the standard representations and outcomes of these reactions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
