    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the given NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For C8H9NO, DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5. A DoU of 5 suggests a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which, according to the n+1 rule, means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH2- group). This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm) are both doublets and each integrates to 2 protons. This pattern is a classic indicator of a 1,4- or para-disubstituted benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts (especially 6.51 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group (EDG) on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons is typical for an amino group (-NH2) or a hydroxyl group (-OH). Given the nitrogen in the molecular formula, this is an amino group (-NH2), which is a strong EDG.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to the -CH2- group we inferred from the aldehyde signal. The doublet multiplicity confirms it is adjacent to a carbon with one proton (the -CH- of the aldehyde). The coupling between the 9.72 ppm proton (triplet) and the 3.66 ppm protons (doublet) confirms the -CH2-CHO moiety.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an acetaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Putting it together gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H9NO. This matches perfectly.\n    *   The NMR is also consistent: The electron-donating -NH2 group shields the ortho protons (6.51 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -CH2CHO group are less shielded (6.98 ppm).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** These are the reagents for **diazotization**. They convert a primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) into a diazonium salt (Ar-N₂⁺Cl⁻) at low temperatures (typically 0-5°C). The aldehyde group remains unaffected.\n        *   Product: 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    2.  **H2O (with warming):** Adding water and warming the diazonium salt solution causes **hydrolysis**, replacing the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). Nitrogen gas (N₂) is liberated.\n        *   Product after steps 1 & 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group), which is the requirement for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields the aldol adduct.\n            *   Aldol Adduct: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure corresponds to **Option D**.\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** is crucial. It promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct to form a more stable, conjugated product. The α-proton (at C2) is acidic and is removed by the base, and the hydroxyl group at C3 is eliminated. This forms a double bond between C2 and C3.\n            *   (HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO  -- (Heat, -H₂O) →  (HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO\n    *   **Final Product Identification:**\n        *   The structure is (HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO.\n        *   Let's name this compound based on IUPAC rules: The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons with an aldehyde and a double bond). Numbering starts from the aldehyde carbon (C1). The double bond is between C2 and C3 (but-2-enal). There are two 4-hydroxyphenyl substituents, one at C2 and one at C4.\n        *   The correct name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n        *   This name and structure correspond exactly to **Option C**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence starts with 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, which is converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This intermediate then undergoes a base-catalyzed self-aldol condensation. Due to the \"Heat\" condition, the reaction proceeds past the initial aldol addition product (Option D) to the final, dehydrated, and highly conjugated condensation product (Option C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
