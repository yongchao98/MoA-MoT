    "An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, especially when its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation λ. This is the simplest and most common physical model for such a system. The radiation from such a dipole provides the answers to both parts of the question.\n\n### Part 1: Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nFor an oscillating electric dipole, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ = f(λ, θ) = (c * k⁴ * |p₀|²) / (32 * π² * ε₀) * sin²(θ)`\n\nHere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, which is related to the wavelength `λ` by `k = 2π/λ`.\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n*   `θ` is the angle with respect to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n*   `c` and `ε₀` are the speed of light and the permittivity of free space, respectively.\n\nWe are interested in the dependence of the radiated power `f` on the wavelength `λ`. From the formula, we can see that the power is proportional to `k⁴`.\n\n`f ∝ k⁴`\n\nSince `k = 2π/λ`, we can substitute this into the proportionality:\n\n`f ∝ (2π/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of dipole radiation and is famously responsible for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue. This result narrows down the possible options to A and D.\n\n### Part 2: Fraction of Maximum Power at θ = 30°\n\nNext, we look at the angular dependence of the radiated power. From the same formula, we see that the power `f` is proportional to `sin²(θ)`:\n\n`f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nThe maximum radiated power, denoted as `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the axis of oscillation). Therefore, the maximum power `A` is proportional to `sin²(90°) = 1² = 1`.\n\n`A ∝ 1`\n\nWe want to find the fraction of this maximum power that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. First, we find the power at this angle:\n\n`f_at_30° ∝ sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`. Therefore:\n\n`sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nSo, `f_at_30° ∝ 1/4`.\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the maximum power `A`:\n\n`Fraction = f_at_30° / A = 1/4 / 1 = 1/4`\n\nSo, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at `30°` is `1/4`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the two results:\n*   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThese two results correspond to option A.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Angle in degrees\ntheta_deg = 30\n\n# Convert angle to radians for numpy's sin function\ntheta_rad = np.radians(theta_deg)\n\n# The fraction of maximum power is given by sin^2(theta) / sin^2(90), which simplifies to sin^2(theta)\n# since sin(90) = 1.\nfraction = np.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\n# The result should be a floating-point number.\n# 1/4 = 0.25\nprint(f\"The fraction of maximum power radiated at 30 degrees is sin^2(30) = {fraction}\")\nprint(\"The wavelength dependence for dipole radiation is λ^(-4).\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the correct option combines a fraction of 1/4 and a wavelength dependence of λ^(-4).\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution is well-approximated by an oscillating electric dipole. The radiated power from such a dipole allows us to determine both the angular distribution and the wavelength dependence.\n\n### 1. Wavelength Dependence\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` from an oscillating electric dipole is given by Larmor's formula adapted for oscillating fields:\n```\ndP/dΩ = f(λ, θ) = (μ₀ * |p̈|²) / (16 * π² * c) * sin²(θ)\n```\nwhere:\n*   `p̈` is the second time derivative of the dipole moment `p(t)`.\n*   `θ` is the angle from the axis of oscillation.\n*   `μ₀` is the permeability of free space and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nFor a dipole oscillating sinusoidally with angular frequency `ω`, the dipole moment is `p(t) = p₀ * cos(ωt)`. The second derivative is `p̈(t) = -ω² * p₀ * cos(ωt)`. The squared amplitude is `|p̈|² = ω⁴ * |p₀|²`.\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πc/λ`.\n\nSubstituting this into the power formula, we see the dependence on `ω` and therefore on `λ`:\n```\ndP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴\n```\nSince `ω ∝ 1/λ`, it follows that:\n```\ndP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n```\nThus, the radiated power `f` has a `λ⁻⁴` dependence. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n### 2. Angular Dependence\n\nFrom the same formula, the power radiated per unit solid angle depends on the angle `θ` as:\n```\ndP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)\n```\nThe maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (perpendicular to the axis of oscillation).\n```\nA ∝ sin²(90°) = 1² = 1\n```\nWe want to find the fraction of this maximum power that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. First, we evaluate the `sin²(θ)` term at this angle:\n```\nPower at 30° ∝ sin²(30°)\n```\nSince `sin(30°) = 1/2`, we have:\n```\nPower at 30° ∝ (1/2)² = 1/4\n```\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the power at `90°`:\n```\nFraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = (k * 1/4) / (k * 1) = 1/4\n```\nwhere `k` is the constant of proportionality.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power radiated at `30°` is **1/4**, and a possible form for the wavelength dependence of `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThese two results match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
