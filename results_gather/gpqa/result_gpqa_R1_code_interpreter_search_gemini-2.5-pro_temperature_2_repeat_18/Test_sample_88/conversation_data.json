    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1 and Product 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. Adamantane derivatives are known to undergo complex rearrangements under such conditions.\n    *   **Product 1 Data:**\n        *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n        *   ¹H NMR: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration is 14H. The starting 1,3-dibromoadamantane is C₁₀H₁₄Br₂. A likely formula for Product 1 is C₁₀H₁₄O, which corresponds to the replacement of the two bromine atoms with one oxygen atom (as C=O), maintaining the hydrogen count. The degree of unsaturation for C₁₀H₁₄O is (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2 and Product 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Pondorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones and aldehydes to alcohols.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Product 1 is a ketone, and Product 2 is the corresponding alcohol. So, Product 2 has the formula C₁₀H₁₆O.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3 and Product 3:**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since Product 2 reacts with ozone, it must contain a C=C bond. Consequently, Product 1 (the ketone) must also contain a C=C bond.\n    *   Let's revisit the degree of unsaturation for Product 1 (C₁₀H₁₄O): DoU = 4. We now know it contains one ketone (C=O, 1 DoU) and at least one C=C double bond (1 DoU). This leaves 4 - 1 - 1 = 2 DoUs, which must correspond to two rings. Therefore, Product 1 is a **bicyclic enone** (a bicyclic compound containing both a ketone and a double bond). The fragmentation of the tricyclic adamantane skeleton to a bicyclic one is consistent with known adamantane chemistry under harsh conditions.\n\n4.  **Determine the nature of the C=C bond from the NMR of Product 1:**\n    *   The ¹H NMR of Product 1 shows a signal at 4.79 ppm with an integration of 2H. This chemical shift is in the vinylic region, corresponding to protons on a double bond (H-C=C-H). The fact that there are two equivalent vinylic protons suggests a symmetrical structure around the double bond.\n    *   A likely structural fragment that would give two equivalent vinylic protons and could lead to a logical answer is `-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-` embedded in one of the rings, with a plane of symmetry or a C₂ axis passing through the C=C bond. The two `CH` protons would be equivalent (the 2H signal at 4.79 ppm), and the two `CH₂` groups would also be equivalent (their 4H signal would be part of the large 10H multiplet).\n\n5.  **Predict the structure of Product 3 and the coupling pattern:**\n    *   **Ozonolysis:** The ozonolysis of Product 2, the alcohol form of the bicyclic enone, cleaves the C=C bond. Let's focus on the symmetrical fragment we deduced: `-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-`.\n    *   `...-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-...` --(O₃/DMS)--> `...-CH₂-CHO` + `OHC-CH₂-...`\n    *   This means Product 3 is a dicarbonyl compound (specifically, a dialdehyde, as the workup is reductive) and also contains the alcohol group from Product 2. So, Product 3 will have at least one `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **The Final Question:** We need the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton). Aldehyde protons (-CHO) are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons, typically appearing at δ = 9-10 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Analysis:** Let's analyze the coupling of the aldehyde proton in the `-CH₂-CHO` fragment. The aldehyde proton (H-C=O) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon). In this case, the adjacent carbon is a methylene group (-CH₂-). According to the n+1 rule, coupling to two equivalent neighboring protons will split the signal into a (2+1) = 3 line pattern.\n    *   Therefore, the aldehyde proton signal will be a **triplet**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the reaction sequence and spectroscopic analysis, the most logical conclusion is that Product 3 contains an aldehyde group adjacent to a methylene group, resulting in a triplet signal for the aldehyde proton.\n\n<<<D>>>"
