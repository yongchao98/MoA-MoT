    "Here's my reasoning process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Understand the Request:** The goal is to compute the area of a surface described by the given metric. The surface is called a \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the Metric:**\n    The provided metric is:\n    $ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n    This is a metric on a 2-dimensional surface parameterized by Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. The metric is of the form $ds^2 = f(x,y)(dx^2 + dy^2)$, which is a conformally flat metric.\n\n3.  **Determine the Area Element:**\n    For a general 2D metric given by $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + 2g_{xy}dxdy + g_{yy}dy^2$, the area element $dA$ is given by the formula $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$, where $g$ is the metric tensor:\n    $g = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{xx} & g_{xy} \\\\ g_{yx} & g_{yy} \\end{pmatrix}$\n    From the given metric, we can identify the components of the metric tensor:\n    $g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n    $g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n    $g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n    The metric tensor is:\n    $g = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Now, let's compute the determinant of $g$:\n    $\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}g_{yx} = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2$\n    The area element is then:\n    $dA = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2} \\, dx \\, dy = \\left|\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right| \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n4.  **Define the Region of Integration:**\n    The term \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" and the form of the metric denominator $(4-x^2-y^2)$ suggest that the surface is defined over the domain where the metric is well-behaved and positive definite. The metric becomes singular when $x^2 + y^2 = 4$. The natural domain for this metric is the open disk $D$ defined by $x^2 + y^2 < 4$. Inside this disk, $4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0$, so the absolute value in the area element formula is not necessary.\n    $dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n    The area of the surface is the integral of this area element over the disk $D$.\n    $A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n5.  **Perform the Integration:**\n    To evaluate this integral, it is convenient to switch to polar coordinates.\n    Let $x = r \\cos \\theta$ and $y = r \\sin \\theta$.\n    Then $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$.\n    The area element $dx \\, dy$ becomes $r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$.\n    The region of integration $D: x^2 + y^2 < 4$ is described in polar coordinates by $0 \\le r < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$.\n    The area integral becomes:\n    $A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-r^2} \\cdot r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    $A = \\left(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} dr\\right)$\n    The first integral is straightforward:\n    $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 2\\pi$\n\n    The second integral is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32r}{4-r^2}$ is unbounded as $r \\to 2$. We evaluate it using a limit:\n    $I_r = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} dr = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} dr$\n    To solve this integral, we use the substitution $u = 4 - r^2$. Then $du = -2r \\, dr$, which means $r \\, dr = -\\frac{1}{2} \\, du$.\n    The limits of integration for $u$ are:\n    When $r=0$, $u = 4 - 0^2 = 4$.\n    When $r=a$, $u = 4 - a^2$.\n    $I_r = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\int_{4}^{4-a^2} \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\, du\\right) = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} -16 \\int_{4}^{4-a^2} \\frac{1}{u} du$\n    Reversing the limits of integration to remove the negative sign:\n    $I_r = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} 16 \\int_{4-a^2}^{4} \\frac{1}{u} du = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} 16 \\left[ \\ln|u| \\right]_{4-a^2}^{4}$\n    $I_r = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} 16 \\left( \\ln(4) - \\ln(4-a^2) \\right)$\n    As $a \\to 2^-$, the term $4-a^2$ approaches $0^+$. The natural logarithm $\\ln(4-a^2)$ approaches $-\\infty$.\n    So, the limit is:\n    $I_r = 16 \\left( \\ln(4) - (-\\infty) \\right) = +\\infty$\n\n    The radial integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the total area is:\n    $A = 2\\pi \\cdot (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculation shows that the area is infinite. This matches option D. Options A and C are functions of coordinates, which cannot represent the total area of a surface. Option B is incorrect because the area element is always positive.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation Summary:\nThe area of the specified surface is given by the integral of its area element over the domain $x^2+y^2 < 4$.\n$$ A = \\iint_{x^2+y^2<4} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\,dx\\,dy $$\nBy converting to polar coordinates, the integral becomes:\n$$ A = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^2 \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\,dr\\,d\\theta $$\nThis integral is improper and diverges to $+\\infty$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
