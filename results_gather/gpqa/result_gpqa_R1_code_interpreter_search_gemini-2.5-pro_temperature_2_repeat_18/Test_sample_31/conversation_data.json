    "Here's a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Particle:** The question specifies the nucleus \"X\" as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n    *   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n    *   With 3 neutrons (N), the total mass number (A) is Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:** We need to find the total relativistic energy (E) of this ⁶Li nucleus when its speed (v) is 0.96c, where c is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Formula:** The total relativistic energy (E) of a particle is given by the formula:\n    E = γ * E₀\n    where:\n    *   E₀ is the rest energy of the particle (E₀ = m₀c², with m₀ being the rest mass).\n    *   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   We are given v = 0.96c.\n    *   Therefore, v/c = 0.96.\n    *   v²/c² = (0.96)² = 0.9216.\n    *   1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.\n    *   √(1 - v²/c²) = √0.0784 = 0.28.\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.571428\n\n5.  **Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀) of the ⁶Li Nucleus:** This is the most critical step. There are two common ways to determine the rest mass/energy of a nucleus:\n    *   **Method A (High Precision):** Use the experimentally measured atomic mass of ⁶Li and subtract the mass of the electrons. This accounts for the nuclear binding energy.\n    *   **Method B (Approximation):** Approximate the nucleus's mass by simply summing the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons. This method ignores the binding energy that holds the nucleus together. In many physics problems, this approximation is sufficient and intended.\n\n    Let's evaluate Method B, as it's a common simplification. We'll need the rest energies of a proton and a neutron.\n    *   Rest energy of a proton (m_p * c²) ≈ 0.93827 GeV\n    *   Rest energy of a neutron (m_n * c²) ≈ 0.93957 GeV\n\n    The ⁶Li nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n    E₀ ≈ (3 * m_p * c²) + (3 * m_n * c²)\n    E₀ ≈ 3 * (0.93827 GeV) + 3 * (0.93957 GeV)\n    E₀ ≈ 3 * (0.93827 + 0.93957) GeV\n    E₀ ≈ 3 * (1.87784) GeV\n    E₀ ≈ 5.63352 GeV\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E):** Now, combine the results from steps 4 and 5.\n    E = γ * E₀\n    E ≈ 3.571428 * 5.63352 GeV\n    E ≈ 20.1197 GeV\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 21.419 GeV\n    *   B) 23.069 GeV\n    *   C) 20.132 GeV\n    *   D) 18.475 GeV\n\n    Our calculated value, 20.1197 GeV, is extremely close to option C, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (about 0.06%) is likely due to using slightly different reference values for the proton and neutron masses than what the problem creator used. The other options are significantly different.\n\nTo confirm the calculation with higher precision, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Use standard values for rest energies in GeV\nproton_rest_energy_GeV = 0.938272088\nneutron_rest_energy_GeV = 0.939565420\n\n# Number of protons and neutrons in Li-6\nnum_protons = 3\nnum_neutrons = 3\n\n# Speed of the nucleus as a fraction of the speed of light\nv_over_c = 0.96\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1. Approximate the rest energy of the nucleus by summing constituent rest energies\nnucleus_rest_energy_GeV = (num_protons * proton_rest_energy_GeV) + (num_neutrons * neutron_rest_energy_GeV)\n\n# 2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nlorentz_gamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# 3. Calculate the total relativistic energy\ntotal_energy_GeV = lorentz_gamma * nucleus_rest_energy_GeV\n\nprint(f\"{total_energy_GeV:.4f}\")\n```\n\nExecution of the code yields the result `20.1197`. This confirms our manual calculation and points strongly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",

Identify the particle and its properties:**\n\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus \"X\" as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Standard Lithium (Li) has an atomic number Z=3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n*   With 3 neutrons (N=3), the total mass number is A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   So, the particle is a Lithium-6 nucleus (⁶Li).\n*   A ⁶Li nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n\n### **2. State the goal and the physical formula:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the total relativistic energy (E).\n*   **Speed:** v = 0.96c, where 'c' is the speed of light.\n*   **Formula:** The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by E = γ * E₀, where:\n    *   E₀ is the rest energy of the particle (E₀ = m₀c²).\n    *   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n### **3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n\n*   Given v = 0.96c, the ratio v/c = 0.96.\n*   First, calculate v²/c²: (0.96)² = 0.9216.\n*   Next, calculate the term under the square root: 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.\n*   Then, take the square root: √0.0784 = 0.28.\n*   Finally, calculate γ: γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀) of the ⁶Li nucleus:**\n\nThe rest energy can be approximated by summing the rest energies of its constituent protons and neutrons.

The minor difference (~0.06%) is attributable to the specific reference values for proton/neutron mass used by the source of the question.

    "### **Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to find the total relativistic energy of a specific Lithium nucleus traveling at a very high speed.\n    *   **Particle:** The nucleus is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n        *   Lithium's atomic number (Z) is 3, so it has 3 protons.\n        *   Given 3 neutrons (N), the mass number (A) is Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n        *   Therefore, the particle is a Lithium-6 (⁶Li) nucleus.\n    *   **Speed (v):** v = 0.96c (where 'c' is the speed of light).\n    *   **Goal:** Calculate the total relativistic energy (E).\n\n2.  **Select the Physical Formula:** The total energy (E) of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by the equation:\n    *   E = γ * E₀\n    *   Where E₀ is the rest energy (E₀ = m₀c²) and γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n        *   The formula is γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n        *   We are given v = 0.96c, which means the ratio v/c = 0.96.\n        *   Calculate (v/c)²: (0.96)² = 0.9216.\n        *   Calculate 1 - (v/c)²: 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.\n        *   Take the square root: √0.0784 = 0.28.\n        *   Finally, find γ: γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57143.\n\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀) of the ⁶Li nucleus**\n        *   A common and direct method is to approximate the nucleus's rest energy by summing the rest energies of its constituent parts (3 protons and 3 neutrons). This approach ignores nuclear binding energy, but it's standard for problems of this type unless an exact nuclear mass is provided.\n        *   We need the rest energies of a proton and a neutron in Giga-electron Volts (GeV).
