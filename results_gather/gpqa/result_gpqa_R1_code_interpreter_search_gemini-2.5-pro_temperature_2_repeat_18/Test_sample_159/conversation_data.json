    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture for an Infinitely Large N:**\n    *   The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the line segment from the center to the midpoint of a side.\n    *   As the number of sides, N, approaches infinity (N → ∞), a regular polygon approaches a circle.\n    *   In this limit, the apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of the resulting circle. So, the aperture becomes a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:**\n    *   When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a characteristic diffraction pattern in the far-field known as an Airy pattern.\n    *   The intensity distribution of this pattern is described by the formula:\n        I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(x) / x]²\n        where:\n        *   I₀ is the intensity at the center of the pattern.\n        *   θ is the angular position from the central axis.\n        *   J₁ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order 1.\n        *   The argument x is given by `x = k * a * sin(θ)`, where `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number, 'a' is the radius of the aperture, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\n3.  **Locating the Minima:**\n    *   The minima (points of zero intensity) in the Airy pattern occur when the numerator, J₁(x), is equal to zero (and x ≠ 0, as x=0 is the central maximum).\n    *   So, we need to find the values of x for which J₁(x) = 0. These are the roots or zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\n4.  **Zeros of the Bessel Function J₁(x):**\n    *   The zeros of J₁(x) are well-known and can be found in mathematical tables or calculated numerically. The first few non-zero roots are approximately:\n        *   First zero (j₁.₁):  x₁ ≈ 3.832\n        *   Second zero (j₁.₂): x₂ ≈ 7.016\n        *   Third zero (j₁.₃):  x₃ ≈ 10.173\n        ... and so on.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Angular Position of the Minima:**\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) corresponds to the first zero, x₁:\n        k * a * sin(θ₁) = x₁\n        (2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₁) = 3.832\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) corresponds to the second zero, x₂:\n        k * a * sin(θ₂) = x₂\n        (2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₂) = 7.016\n\n6.  **Applying the Small Angle Approximation:**\n    *   The problem states we can use the small angle approximation, where `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n    *   For the first minimum:\n        (2π / λ) * a * θ₁ ≈ 3.832\n        θ₁ ≈ (3.832 / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)\n    *   For the second minimum:\n        (2π / λ) * a * θ₂ ≈ 7.016\n        θ₂ ≈ (7.016 / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.117 * (λ / a)\n\n7.  **Finding the Angular Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    *   Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ 1.117 * (λ / a) - 0.610 * (λ / a)\n    *   Δθ ≈ (1.117 - 0.610) * (λ / a)\n    *   Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ / a)\n\n8.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ / a).\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        A) 0.506 λ / a\n        B) 1.220 λ /a\n        C) 0.500 λ / a\n        D) 0.610 λ / a\n    *   The value 0.506 λ / a is the closest to our calculated value. The small difference is due to the precision of the Bessel function zeros used.\n\n<<<A>>>"
