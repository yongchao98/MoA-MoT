    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Compound X with a molecular formula of C11H12O.\n*   **Reagents and Conditions:** 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base, in a nonpolar solvent at a high temperature (403 K = 130 °C).\n*   **Reaction Type:** These conditions are characteristic of a base-catalyzed isomerization or rearrangement reaction. The starting material and product are isomers. Since the provided options for X are all vinyl epoxides, the reaction is a vinyl epoxide rearrangement. Such rearrangements typically convert a vinyl epoxide into an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra to Determine its Structure**\n\nFirst, let's determine the product's degree of unsaturation (DoU) from its molecular formula, C11H12O (which is the same as the starting material X).\nDoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6.\nA DoU of 6 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (DoU=4) and two additional double bonds or rings.\n\n**Analysis of the 13C NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically in a conjugated ketone. This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n*   **δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s):** These signals are in the aliphatic region and correspond to two carbon atoms. The signal at 21.3 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (like in toluene). The signal at 28.4 ppm is likely another methyl group, probably attached to the carbonyl group (an acetyl group).\n*   **Aromatic/Vinylic Region (δ 126.9 - 144.1):** There are 8 carbons in this region.\n    *   δ 141.5 (1C, s) and 144.1 (1C, s): These signals correspond to two quaternary (non-protonated) carbons, typical for substituted carbons in a benzene ring.\n    *   The remaining signals represent carbons with attached protons (CH groups): δ 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s). The notation (nC) indicates the number of carbons giving rise to the signal. Thus, we have (2 + 1 + 2 + 1) = 6 CH carbons in this region.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two sharp singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This confirms the presence of two methyl groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n*   **Aromatic/Vinylic Region (δ 6.75 - 7.71):**\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (**δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**), is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. This accounts for 4 protons and 4 CH carbons of the benzene ring.\n    *   The remaining two signals, **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**, are doublets each integrating to one proton. They are coupled to each other and represent two vinylic protons on a double bond (-CH=CH-). This accounts for 2 protons, 2 CH carbons, and another degree of unsaturation.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Product Structure**\n\nLet's assemble the fragments deduced from the NMR data:\n1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A methyl group attached to this ring (giving a p-tolyl group), accounting for one methyl singlet (~2.31 ppm) and the two aromatic doublets.\n3.  A ketone group (C=O).\n4.  An acetyl methyl group (-CO-CH3), accounting for the other methyl singlet (~2.28 ppm).\n5.  A trans-disubstituted vinyl group (-CH=CH-), accounting for the two vinylic doublets.\n\nLet's connect these pieces to satisfy the formula C11H12O and the spectral data. Attaching the ketone to the vinyl group gives an enone fragment `(-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3)`. Attaching this to the p-tolyl group gives the final structure:\n\n**Product:** 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one (also known as p-methylbenzalacetone).\n\n*   **Formula Check:** C11H12O. Correct.\n*   **DoU Check:** Benzene ring (4) + C=C (1) + C=O (1) = 6. Correct.\n*   **NMR Match:** The structure is fully consistent with all 1H and 13C NMR data, including the chemical shifts, integration, and multiplicity.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound X by Working Backwards**\n\nThe product is `p-tolyl-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`. This product must be an isomer of the starting compound X. The reaction is a vinyl epoxide rearrangement. Therefore, Compound X must be a vinyl epoxide that can rearrange to form this specific ketone.\n\nLet's examine the options for Compound X:\n*   A) 2-styrylepoxide (C10H10O): Incorrect molecular formula.\n*   B) **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**: The structure is `(p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. This molecule has the formula C11H12O and contains the necessary p-tolyl group. Base-catalyzed abstraction of a proton from the carbon of the oxirane ring adjacent to the vinyl group, followed by ring opening, would lead directly to the enolate of 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one, which upon protonation and tautomerization gives the identified product. This is a perfect match.\n*   C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: The structure is `(C6H5)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH3)`. This contains a phenyl group (C6H5-), not a p-tolyl group. A rearrangement would not create the methyl group on the aromatic ring. This is inconsistent with the product's NMR data.\n*   D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: A plausible structure is `(C6H5)-CH=C(CH3)-CH(O)CH2`. This also contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group, and is therefore inconsistent with the product structure. Furthermore, its rearrangement would lead to a different ketone with a different NMR spectrum.\n\nBased on this analysis, the starting material, Compound X, must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
