    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have two reactions starting from two compounds, A and B.\n    *   A and B are stereoisomers of the same molecule, as indicated by the options.\n    *   Reaction 1: `A + LiBH4 + H+  ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   Reaction 2: `B + BH3 + H+    ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   The goal is to determine the correct stereochemistry ((R) or (S)) for the starting materials A and B.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structures:**\n    *   **Product:** `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n        *   \"pyran\": A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n        *   \"2-one\": A carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. This makes it a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n        *   \"tetrahydro\": The ring is saturated.\n        *   \"4-ethyl\": An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is at position 4.\n        *   This molecule has a single chiral center at position 4, the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group. The problem specifies which enantiomer, (R) or (S), is formed in each reaction.\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** The options all name the starting material as `(R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n        *   This name is chemically ambiguous or non-standard. However, for this molecule to be a plausible precursor to the lactone product through reduction, it must contain functional groups that can be reduced to an alcohol and a carboxylic acid, which can then cyclize.\n        *   The most logical structure is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n        *   The structure is: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl`.\n        *   This molecule possesses the necessary features:\n            *   A carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n            *   An ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`).\n            *   A single chiral center at C-3 (the carbon with the ethyl group), which will become the chiral center at C-4 in the lactone product.\n        *   Let's assume this is the intended structure for A and B.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reagents and Reactions (Chemoselectivity):**\n    *   The core of the problem lies in the different selectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3.\n    *   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** This is a relatively mild reducing agent. Its key selectivity for this problem is:\n        *   It **reduces** esters to primary alcohols.\n        *   It does **not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH3 (Borane):** This is a strong reducing agent with a unique selectivity:\n        *   It is one of the few reagents that readily **reduces** carboxylic acids to primary alcohols.\n        *   It also reduces esters, but it is much more reactive towards carboxylic acids. Therefore, in a molecule with both groups, it will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid**.\n\n4.  **Trace Reaction 1:**\n    *   `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-lactone`\n    *   **Step 1 (Reduction):** LiBH4 will selectively reduce the ester group. The carboxylic acid will not react.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu` --(LiBH4)--> `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    *   **Step 2 (Lactonization):** The product is a hydroxy-acid (`5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`). In the presence of acid (H+ from workup), the hydroxyl group will attack the carboxylic acid group, eliminating water and forming the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the functional groups (C1 and C5 positions of the chain). The chiral center (C3) is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, its stereochemical configuration is retained.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To obtain the `(R)-lactone` product, the starting material `A` must have the **(R)** configuration.\n        *   (R)-Starting Material --> (R)-Hydroxy-acid --> (R)-Lactone.\n\n5.  **Trace Reaction 2:**\n    *   `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-lactone`\n    *   **Step 1 (Reduction):** BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group. The ester group will not react.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu` --(BH3)--> `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`\n    *   **Step 2 (Lactonization):** The product is a hydroxy-ester (`isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`). Under acidic workup conditions (H+), an intramolecular transesterification can occur. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester's carbonyl carbon, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) and forming the lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center (C3) is not affected. Its configuration is retained.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To obtain the `(S)-lactone` product, the starting material `B` must have the **(S)** configuration.\n        *   (S)-Starting Material --> (S)-Hydroxy-ester --> (S)-Lactone.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   From Reaction 1, we deduced that A is the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   From Reaction 2, we deduced that B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, we match our findings with the given options:\n        *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n        *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
