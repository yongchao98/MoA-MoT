    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, in a solution containing known amounts of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. This solution constitutes a buffer system.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species:**\n    *   KH2PO4 dissolves in water to form K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate ion). H2PO4- is the conjugate acid in our main buffer system.\n    *   Na2HPO4·2H2O dissolves to form 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion), and 2 water molecules. HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.\n    *   The solution is a buffer formed by the H2PO4- / HPO4^2- pair.\n\n2.  **Determine the relevant equilibria:**\n    Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps:\n    *   H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4-  (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n    *   H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n    *   HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-  (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n\n    The primary equilibrium that sets the pH of the buffer is the second one, involving the H2PO4-/HPO4^2- pair (Ka2). The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is produced in the third equilibrium (Ka3).\n\n3.  **Calculate initial moles of the buffer components:**\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Since KH2PO4 dissociates completely, Moles of H2PO4- = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Since Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates completely, Moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005618 mol.\n\n4.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    *   Volume = 200.00 cm3 = 0.20000 L\n    *   Initial [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Initial [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n5.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 expression:**\n    The equilibrium is H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-.\n    Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n    [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    Assuming the initial concentrations are a good approximation of the equilibrium concentrations (a valid assumption for buffers):\n    [H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H+] = 8.110 x 10^-8 M\n\n6.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 expression:**\n    The relevant equilibrium is HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-.\n    Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    We rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n    [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n    Using the calculated [H+] and the initial concentration of HPO4^2- (since its dissociation is negligible, governed by the very small Ka3):\n    [PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.110 x 10^-8 M)\n    [PO4^3-] = 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis calculation can also be done using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00 # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99 # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000 # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Moles of the buffer components\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Concentrations of the buffer components\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Calculate hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Calculate orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_po4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_po4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n\n```output\n6.24e-07\n\n```\nThe calculated value for the concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4^3-] is 6.24 x 10^-7 M.
