    "An optically active compound is a chiral compound that can rotate the plane of polarized light. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature causing chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups). However, a molecule with chiral centers can be achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (such molecules are called meso compounds). We will analyze each compound to determine its chirality.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   This molecule does not contain any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). All carbon atoms are either sp2 hybridized (part of the double bond) or are bonded to at least two identical groups (e.g., C3 is a CH2 group).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry. The plane containing the C=C double bond and the atoms attached to it (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) is a plane of symmetry for the molecule if the ethyl group is oriented correctly.\n    *   Since it is achiral, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)` and `(E)` specify a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   The designation of absolute configurations like `(R)` or `(S)` means that there are chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   When a specific enantiomer is named (e.g., using R/S notation) and it's not a meso compound, it refers to a pure chiral substance. A pure enantiomer is, by definition, optically active. Although the parent structure without the substituent might be meso, the substituent destroys any symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as `(2R, 3S)`. This is a classic example of a meso compound. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond, making one half of the molecule the mirror image of the other.\n    *   Due to this internal symmetry, the molecule is achiral despite having two chiral centers.\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound, with the configuration `(2R, 3R)`.\n    *   In this configuration, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S, 3S)` enantiomer.\n    *   Since it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) -CH2-CH2- (C2 and part of the ring), and (4) -CH=CH- (C6 and part of the ring). These four groups are different.\n    *   Thus, C1 is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Whether in the chair conformation with all OH groups axial or all equatorial, this molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold rotational axis (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through a C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom.\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butanone chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-CO-cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl (`-CH3`) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   No other atom in the molecule is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not have any other source of chirality like axial or planar chirality. It is flexible and possesses conformations with a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
