Analyze the Products and Their Quantities**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms reacting with the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   First, let's identify Gas C. The total mass of the initial mixture is 7.20 g. The mass of the known products (H₂O and the oxygen that reacted with Cu) is 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g.\n*   The mass of Gas C must be the remaining mass: 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n*   We can now calculate the molar mass of Gas C: Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is **nitrogen (N₂)**.\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (moles of O atoms from Tube 3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The overall molar ratio of the elements in this mixture is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely to be ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n\nLet's test the most common candidates:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are **ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 19\nD) 17\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided methods.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases by passing them through a series of tubes. We can determine the identity and quantity of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (e.g., CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, meaning an oxidizing gas in the stream supplied 0.80 g of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts. We can now determine the elemental composition of the initial mixture.\n\n*   First, we identify Gas C by using the mass balance. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O atoms from Tube 3)\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nWith all products identified, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n### **3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. Therefore, the overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely to be ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n\nLet's test the most common candidates:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n### **4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 13\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 17\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this chemistry problem by breaking it down into logical steps that can be implemented in Python.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** I will first calculate the molar amounts of the gaseous products based on the experimental data provided.\n    *   The mass increase in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ gives the moles of water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase in the tube with copper gives the moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted.\n    *   The volume of the final gas at STP gives the moles of the inert gas, which I will identify.\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition:** Using the law of conservation of mass, I will calculate the total moles of each element (Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen) present in the original 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts:** Since the mixture is equimolar, the elemental ratio I found corresponds to the combined formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B. I will deduce this combined formula (NₓHᵧO₂) and then identify the two common ammonium salts that sum up to it.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Atoms:** Once the formulas for salts A and B are known, I will count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each and add them together.\n\n5.  **Select the Final Answer:** Finally, I will match the calculated total number of atoms to the given multiple-choice options to determine the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemistry problem by calculating the elemental composition of the salts\n    and determining the total number of atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the Products ---\n    # Given data\n    mass_mixture = 7.20  # g\n    mass_h2o = 3.60      # g, from tube 1\n    mass_o_atoms = 0.80  # g, from tube 3\n    volume_gas_c = 2.24  # L at STP\n\n    # Molar masses and constants\n    MOLAR_MASS_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\n    MOLAR_MASS_O = 15.999    # g/mol\n    MOLAR_MASS_H = 1.008     # g/mol\n    MOLAR_MASS_N = 14.007    # g/mol\n    MOLAR_VOLUME_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\n\n    # Calculate moles of known products\n    moles_h2o = mass_h2o / MOLAR_MASS_H2O\n    moles_o_from_tube3 = mass_o_atoms / MOLAR_MASS_O\n    moles_gas_c = volume_gas_c / MOLAR_VOLUME_STP\n\n    # --- Step 2: Determine Elemental Composition ---\n    # Calculate total moles of each element in the original mixture\n    moles_h_total = moles_h2o * 2\n    moles_o_total = moles_h2o + moles_o_from_tube3\n\n    # Calculate mass of H and O to find mass of N by difference\n    mass_h_total = moles_h_total * MOLAR_MASS_H\n    mass_o_total = moles_o_total * MOLAR_MASS_O\n    mass_n_total = mass_mixture - mass_h_total - mass_o_total\n    \n    moles_n_total = mass_n_total / MOLAR_MASS_N\n\n    # --- Step 3: Identify the Salts ---\n    # The molar ratio N:H:O in the combined formula (A+B) is:\n    # moles_n_total : moles_h_total : moles_o_total\n    # To get the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value\n    # and then multiply to clear fractions.\n    # Ratio is approx 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25 -> 1 : 2 : 1.25 -> 4 : 8 : 5\n    # So the combined formula is N4H8O5.\n    # We need to find two salts that sum to this.\n    # Candidate A: Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3) -> N2H4O3\n    # Candidate B: Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2) -> N2H4O2\n    # Sum: (N2H4O3) + (N2H4O2) = N4H8O5.

Analyze the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a salt mixture and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products. We can determine the identity and amount of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (e.g., CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, meaning 0.80 g of oxygen atoms from the gas stream reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts.\n\n*   First, let's identify Gas C by checking the mass balance.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O from CuO) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is **nitrogen (N₂)**.\n\n*   Now, we can calculate the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n        *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n        *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply by 4 to clear the fraction:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25  (multiplied by 4) → **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions:\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nAdding their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4.

Analyze the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases by passing them through a series of tubes. We can determine the identity and amount of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).

Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, meaning 0.80 g of oxygen atoms from the gas stream reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Identity and Moles of the Remaining Element:** We can find the mass of the remaining element(s) by subtracting the mass of H and O from the total initial mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of remaining element(s) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   This 2.80 g corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. We can find its molar mass:\n        Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). This is consistent with the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n    *   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n        Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### **3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiplying the ratio by 4 gives whole numbers: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nSo, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that sum to this formula.

Analysis of the Gaseous Products\nThe problem describes heating a mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases by passing them through a series of tubes. The changes in each tube allow us to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms from the gas stream reacting with the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can determine the elemental makeup of the original 7.20 g mixture from the products.\n\n*   First, we identify Gas C. The total mass of the elements accounted for so far is:\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g\n    *   The mass of Gas C is the remaining mass of the initial mixture: 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C is its mass divided by its moles: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n*   Now, we calculate the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂. Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper. Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Therefore, the overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula of (A + B) is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20): N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25.\n*   To eliminate the fraction, we multiply the entire ratio by 4: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nThe combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O and decompose into gases, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### 4.

We can determine the identity and quantity of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (e.g., CO₂).

Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original salts.\n\n*   First, let's identify Gas C. The total mass of the initial mixture is 7.20 g. The mass of the known products (H₂O and the oxygen that reacted with Cu) is 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g. The remaining mass must belong to Gas C.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n*   We can now calculate the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3.

The overall molar ratio of the elements in this mixture is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely to be ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n\nLet's test the most common candidates:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are **ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n**4.

The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass. The mass of Gas C is the initial mass minus the mass of the other products.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g (initial) - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O atoms) = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n*   Now, we calculate the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n        *   Total moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Total moles of O = (0.20 mol from H₂O) + (0.05 mol from Tube 3) = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3.

We can determine the identity and quantity of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, **no acidic gases were formed**. This indicates the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms from the gas stream reacting with the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original salts. We can identify Gas C and determine the elemental makeup of the initial mixture.\n\n*   **Identify Gas C:** The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O atoms in CuO)\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is **nitrogen (N₂)**.\n\n*   **Calculate Total Moles of Each Element:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n        *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that reacted with Cu)\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. This means the total elemental content (0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, 0.25 mol O) comes from an equal number of moles of salt A and salt B. Therefore, the ratio of atoms in the combined formula unit of (A + B) is the same as the molar ratio of the elements.\n\n*   Ratio N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n*   To get the simplest integer ratio, divide by the smallest number (0.20):\n    *   N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   To eliminate the decimal, multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n    *   N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts made of N, H, and O that sum to this formula. Ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions are the most likely candidates.\n\n*   **Salt A candidate:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Salt B candidate:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃) = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂) = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17.

Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe first step is to identify the products of the thermal decomposition and their quantities based on the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This implies the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms from the gas stream reacting with the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can determine the elemental composition of the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass in the original sample must be nitrogen.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This is consistent with the 0.10 mol of remaining gas C being N₂ (which contains 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol of N atoms).\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Therefore, the molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula unit of (A + B) is the same as the molar ratio we just calculated:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   Divide by 0.20: N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiply by 4: N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most likely candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis result can also be found directly from the combined formula N₄H₈O₅:\nTotal atoms = 4 (N) + 8 (H) + 5 (O) = 17.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17.

Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a 7.20 g salt mixture. The resulting gases are analyzed sequentially.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (e.g., CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This means 0.80 g of oxygen atoms from the gas stream reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the atoms in the products must have originated from the initial salt mixture.\n\n*   **Identify Gas C:** We can find the mass of Gas C by subtracting the masses of the other products from the initial total mass. The mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper is 0.80 g, and the mass of the water is 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g (total) - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O atoms) = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n*   **Calculate Total Moles of Each Element:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂. Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper. Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The overall molar ratio of the elements in this mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\n    N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   To eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n    N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are very likely to be ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming the atoms in one formula unit of each: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 15\nB) 17\nC) 19\nD) 13\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1.

The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂).

Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can determine the elemental composition of the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   First, identify Gas C. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now, calculate the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\nThe total mass of these elements is (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol) = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Therefore, the overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula unit of (Salt A + Salt B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get the simplest whole number ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply by 4 to clear the decimal:\n*   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe combined formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We look for two common salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.

The mass of Gas C can be found by subtraction:\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g (initial) - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O atoms) = 2.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C is therefore: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n*   **Calculate Moles of Each Element:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen comes from the 0.20 mol of H₂O.

The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms reacting with the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   First, let's identify Gas C. The total mass of the initial mixture is 7.20 g. The mass of the known products (H₂O and the oxygen that reacted with Cu) is 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g.\n*   The mass of Gas C must be the remaining mass: 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n*   We can now calculate the molar mass of Gas C: Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is **nitrogen (N₂)**.\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (moles of O atoms from Tube 3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The overall molar ratio of the elements in this mixture is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely to be ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n\nLet's test the most common candidates:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are **ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 19\nD) 17\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided methods.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases by passing them through a series of tubes. We can determine the identity and quantity of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (e.g., CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, meaning an oxidizing gas in the stream supplied 0.80 g of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts. We can now determine the elemental composition of the initial mixture.\n\n*   First, we identify Gas C by using the mass balance. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O atoms from Tube 3)\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nWith all products identified, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n### **3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. Therefore, the overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely to be ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n\nLet's test the most common candidates:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n### **4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 13\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 17\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this chemistry problem by breaking it down into logical steps that can be implemented in Python.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** I will first calculate the molar amounts of the gaseous products based on the experimental data provided.\n    *   The mass increase in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ gives the moles of water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase in the tube with copper gives the moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted.\n    *   The volume of the final gas at STP gives the moles of the inert gas, which I will identify.\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition:** Using the law of conservation of mass, I will calculate the total moles of each element (Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen) present in the original 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts:** Since the mixture is equimolar, the elemental ratio I found corresponds to the combined formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B. I will deduce this combined formula (NₓHᵧO₂) and then identify the two common ammonium salts that sum up to it.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Atoms:** Once the formulas for salts A and B are known, I will count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each and add them together.\n\n5.  **Select the Final Answer:** Finally, I will match the calculated total number of atoms to the given multiple-choice options to determine the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemistry problem by calculating the elemental composition of the salts\n    and determining the total number of atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the Products ---\n    # Given data\n    mass_mixture = 7.20  # g\n    mass_h2o = 3.60      # g, from tube 1\n    mass_o_atoms = 0.80  # g, from tube 3\n    volume_gas_c = 2.24  # L at STP\n\n    # Molar masses and constants\n    MOLAR_MASS_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\n    MOLAR_MASS_O = 15.999    # g/mol\n    MOLAR_MASS_H = 1.008     # g/mol\n    MOLAR_MASS_N = 14.007    # g/mol\n    MOLAR_VOLUME_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\n\n    # Calculate moles of known products\n    moles_h2o = mass_h2o / MOLAR_MASS_H2O\n    moles_o_from_tube3 = mass_o_atoms / MOLAR_MASS_O\n    moles_gas_c = volume_gas_c / MOLAR_VOLUME_STP\n\n    # --- Step 2: Determine Elemental Composition ---\n    # Calculate total moles of each element in the original mixture\n    moles_h_total = moles_h2o * 2\n    moles_o_total = moles_h2o + moles_o_from_tube3\n\n    # Calculate mass of H and O to find mass of N by difference\n    mass_h_total = moles_h_total * MOLAR_MASS_H\n    mass_o_total = moles_o_total * MOLAR_MASS_O\n    mass_n_total = mass_mixture - mass_h_total - mass_o_total\n    \n    moles_n_total = mass_n_total / MOLAR_MASS_N\n\n    # --- Step 3: Identify the Salts ---\n    # The molar ratio N:H:O in the combined formula (A+B) is:\n    # moles_n_total : moles_h_total : moles_o_total\n    # To get the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value\n    # and then multiply to clear fractions.\n    # Ratio is approx 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25 -> 1 : 2 : 1.25 -> 4 : 8 : 5\n    # So the combined formula is N4H8O5.\n    # We need to find two salts that sum to this.\n    # Candidate A: Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3) -> N2H4O3\n    # Candidate B: Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2) -> N2H4O2\n    # Sum: (N2H4O3) + (N2H4O2) = N4H8O5.

We can determine the identity and amount of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (e.g., CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, meaning 0.80 g of oxygen atoms from the gas stream reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts.\n\n*   First, let's identify Gas C by checking the mass balance.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O from CuO) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is **nitrogen (N₂)**.\n\n*   Now, we can calculate the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n        *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n        *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3.

Determination of the Elemental Composition\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can determine the elemental makeup of the original 7.20 g mixture from the products.\n\n*   First, we identify Gas C. The total mass of the elements accounted for so far is:\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g\n    *   The mass of Gas C is the remaining mass of the initial mixture: 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C is its mass divided by its moles: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n*   Now, we calculate the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂. Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper. Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Therefore, the overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula of (A + B) is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20): N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25.\n*   To eliminate the fraction, we multiply the entire ratio by 4: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nThe combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O and decompose into gases, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### 4.

Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases by passing them through a series of tubes. We can determine the identity and quantity of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (e.g., CO₂).

Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original salts.\n\n*   First, let's identify Gas C. The total mass of the initial mixture is 7.20 g. The mass of the known products (H₂O and the oxygen that reacted with Cu) is 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g. The remaining mass must belong to Gas C.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n*   We can now calculate the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The overall molar ratio of the elements in this mixture is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely to be ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n\nLet's test the most common candidates:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are **ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n**4.

The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass. The mass of Gas C is the initial mass minus the mass of the other products.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g (initial) - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O atoms) = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n*   Now, we calculate the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n        *   Total moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Total moles of O = (0.20 mol from H₂O) + (0.05 mol from Tube 3) = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Therefore, the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an elemental ratio identical to the molar ratio we just calculated: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To get the simplest integer ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20):\n    *   N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   To eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n    *   N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe combined formula for (Salt A + Salt B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.

We can identify Gas C and determine the elemental makeup of the initial mixture.\n\n*   **Identify Gas C:** The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O atoms in CuO)\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is **nitrogen (N₂)**.\n\n*   **Calculate Total Moles of Each Element:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n        *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that reacted with Cu)\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. This means the total elemental content (0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, 0.25 mol O) comes from an equal number of moles of salt A and salt B. Therefore, the ratio of atoms in the combined formula unit of (A + B) is the same as the molar ratio of the elements.\n\n*   Ratio N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n*   To get the simplest integer ratio, divide by the smallest number (0.20):\n    *   N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   To eliminate the decimal, multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n    *   N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts made of N, H, and O that sum to this formula. Ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions are the most likely candidates.\n\n*   **Salt A candidate:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Salt B candidate:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃) = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂) = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n**5.

Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe first step is to identify the products of the thermal decomposition and their quantities based on the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This implies the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms from the gas stream reacting with the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can determine the elemental composition of the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass in the original sample must be nitrogen.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This is consistent with the 0.10 mol of remaining gas C being N₂ (which contains 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol of N atoms).\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Therefore, the molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula unit of (A + B) is the same as the molar ratio we just calculated:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   Divide by 0.20: N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiply by 4: N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most likely candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis result can also be found directly from the combined formula N₄H₈O₅:\nTotal atoms = 4 (N) + 8 (H) + 5 (O) = 17.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 17\nB) 13\nC) 15\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a 7.20 g salt mixture. The resulting gases are analyzed sequentially.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (e.g., CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This means 0.80 g of oxygen atoms from the gas stream reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the atoms in the products must have originated from the initial salt mixture.\n\n*   **Identify Gas C:** We can find the mass of Gas C by subtracting the masses of the other products from the initial total mass. The mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper is 0.80 g, and the mass of the water is 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g (total) - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O atoms) = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n*   **Calculate Total Moles of Each Element:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂. Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper. Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The overall molar ratio of the elements in this mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\n    N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   To eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n    N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are very likely to be ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming the atoms in one formula unit of each: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 15\nB) 17\nC) 19\nD) 13\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe first step is to identify the products formed when the salt mixture is heated and to quantify them based on the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms from the gas stream reacting with the copper to form copper(II) oxide (CuO).\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can determine the elemental composition of the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   First, identify Gas C. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now, calculate the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\nThe total mass of these elements is (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol) = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Therefore, the overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula unit of (Salt A + Salt B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get the simplest whole number ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply by 4 to clear the decimal:\n*   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe combined formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We look for two common salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4.

The mass of Gas C can be found by subtraction:\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g (initial) - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O atoms) = 2.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C is therefore: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n*   **Calculate Moles of Each Element:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen comes from the 0.20 mol of H₂O.
