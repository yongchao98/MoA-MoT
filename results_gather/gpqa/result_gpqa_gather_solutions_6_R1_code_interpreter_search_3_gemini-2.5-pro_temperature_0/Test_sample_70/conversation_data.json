They all correctly identify the two essential principles:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis ($a$).\n    *   $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$).\n    *   $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nFurthermore, all agents correctly combine these two laws to derive the final formula relating the temperature ratio to the period ratio:\n*   From Kepler's Law, $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n*   Substituting this into the temperature equation gives $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{P^{2/3}} = 1/P^{1/3}$.\n*   This leads to the final, correct relationship:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Consensus on Calculation\n\nAll 15 candidate answers correctly perform the calculation based on the derived formula.\n*   The problem states the orbital period ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n*   The relative period for Planet_2 ($P_2$) is 2.\n*   The relative period for Planet_4 ($P_4$) is 3.5.\n*   Plugging these values into the formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\right)^{1/3}$\n*   The numerical result is consistently calculated as:\n    $(0.5714...)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nThere is an overwhelming consensus that the numerical answer is **~0.83**.\n\n### Step 3: Resolve the Discrepancy and Determine the Final Answer\n\nThe only point of disagreement among the candidate answers is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This is because the agents were clearly working with different or scrambled lists of multiple-choice options.\n\nTo determine the correct final answer, we must use the authoritative list of options provided in the question prompt:\n*   A) ~0.75\n*   B) ~0.57\n*   C) ~0.69\n*   D) ~0.83\n\nMatching the unanimously calculated numerical result of **~0.83** to this list, we find that it corresponds to option **D**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Unanimous Calculation:** The most important finding is that every single agent, regardless of their final letter choice, correctly derived the physics and calculated the numerical value to be ~0.83. This provides extremely high confidence in the result.\n*   **Source of Error:** The discrepancy in the final letter choices is a clerical error resulting from inconsistent option lists, not a scientific or mathematical error.\n*   **Correct Ratio Inversion:** A crucial step in the derivation is that the temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ is related to the *inverse* period ratio $(P_2/P_4)^{1/3}$.

This relationship is expressed as:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$). This is expressed as:\n        $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n2.  **Derive the Relationship between Temperature and Period:** The goal is to find a direct relationship between temperature and period to use the given data.\n    *   First, rearrange Kepler's Third Law to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period: $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n    *   Next, substitute this expression for $a$ into the equilibrium temperature formula:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P^{2/3}}}$\n    *   Using the rules of exponents, $(x^m)^n = x^{m \\cdot n}$, this simplifies to:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{(2/3) \\cdot (1/2)}} = \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** Using the derived relationship, we can set up the ratio for the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{P_4^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    This final formula is correctly and unanimously derived by all candidate answers, showing a strong consensus on the underlying physics.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   The relative period for Planet_2 ($P_2$) is 2.\n    *   The relative period for Planet_4 ($P_4$) is 3.5.\n    *   The ratio of their periods is: $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5} = \\frac{4}{7}$.\n    *   Now, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:** The calculated value is approximately **0.83**.

The final step is to match this value to the options provided in the question:\n    A) ~0.75\n    B) ~0.69\n    C) ~0.57\n    D) ~0.83\n\n    The calculated value of ~0.83 directly matches option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Consensus on Method:** There is a complete consensus among all provided answers on the physical laws, the derived formula, and the final numerical result (~0.83). This gives very high confidence in the calculation.\n*   **Source of Error in Candidate Answers:** The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) among the candidates are due to inconsistencies in the option lists they were working with. The analysis must rely on the options as presented in the original problem statement.\n*   **Contextual Information:** The mention of the TTV (Transit Timing Variation) method and orbital resonance provides a realistic physical context for the system but is not directly needed for the mathematical solution. The key information is the period ratios and the fact that the planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** A critical step is correctly inverting the period ratio ($P_2/P_4$) when calculating the temperature ratio ($T_{eq,4}/T_{eq,2}$) because of the inverse relationship between temperature and period.

This requires two fundamental laws of astrophysics:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** For planets orbiting the same star and possessing the same albedo (reflectivity), the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`). This is because the intensity of starlight decreases with the square of the distance, and temperature is related to the fourth root of power. The relationship is:\n        T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`). The relationship is:\n        P² ∝ a³\n\n3.  **Combine the Principles:** The goal is to find a direct relationship between temperature (T_eq) and period (P).\n    *   First, rearrange Kepler's Third Law to express the distance (`a`) in terms of the period (`P`):\n        a ∝ P^(2/3)\n    *   Next, substitute this expression for `a` into the equilibrium temperature relationship:\n        T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\n    *   Using the rules of exponents, where (x^m)^n = x^(m*n), we can simplify the formula:\n        T_eq ∝ 1 / P^((2/3) * (1/2)) = 1 / P^(1/3)\n    *   This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio:** Now we can write the ratio for Planet_4 and Planet_2 using the relationship derived in the previous step.\n    *   T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (P₄)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)\n    *   This can be rewritten as: T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (P₄ / P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:** The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   The relative period for Planet_2 (P₂) is 2.\n    *   The relative period for Planet_4 (P₄) is 3.5.\n    *   Substitute these values into the formula:\n        T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    *   Simplify the fraction: 2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7.\n    *   Calculate the final value:\n        T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is approximately **0.83**.

The problem statement explicitly provides these conditions.\n*   **Contextual Information:** The mention of the TTV method and orbital resonance is contextual information that explains why such a stable system with simple period ratios might exist. It is not directly needed for the calculation itself.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** Correctly combining the exponents is crucial. The step `(P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3)` is the key to linking the two physical laws.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** A common mistake is to forget that the relationship is inverse. The temperature ratio T₄/T₂ is related to the period ratio P₂/P₄ (note the flipped indices), not P₄/P₂.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All candidate answers correctly derived the physics and performed the calculation, arriving at the numerical result of ~0.83.

When comparing planets that orbit the same star and have the same albedo (reflectivity), as is the case here, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).\n    *   $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law establishes a precise relationship between a planet's orbital period (`P`) and its semi-major axis (`a`). For planets orbiting the same central star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.\n    *   $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n### Step 2: Derive the Relationship Between Temperature and Period\nThe problem gives us information about orbital periods, but the temperature formula uses orbital distance. Therefore, we must combine the two principles to find a direct relationship between temperature and period.\n\n*   First, we rearrange Kepler's Third Law to express the distance (`a`) in terms of the period (`P`):\n    *   $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n*   Next, we substitute this expression for `a` into the equilibrium temperature relationship:\n    *   $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P^{2/3}}}$\n*   Using the rules of exponents, where $(x^m)^n = x^{m \\cdot n}$, we simplify the expression:\n    *   $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{(2/3) \\cdot (1/2)}} = \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis key result shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Ratio and Perform the Calculation\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$). Using the relationship derived in Step 2:\n\n*   $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{P_4^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem states that the ratio of orbital periods is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

This requires two fundamental laws of astrophysics:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** For planets orbiting the same star and possessing the same albedo (reflectivity), the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`). This is because the intensity of starlight decreases with the square of the distance, and temperature is related to the fourth root of power. The relationship is:\n        T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`). The relationship is:\n        P² ∝ a³\n\n3.  **Combine the Principles:** The goal is to find a direct relationship between temperature (T_eq) and period (P).\n    *   First, rearrange Kepler's Third Law to express the distance (`a`) in terms of the period (`P`):\n        a ∝ P^(2/3)\n    *   Next, substitute this expression for `a` into the equilibrium temperature relationship:\n        T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\n    *   Using the rules of exponents, where (x^m)^n = x^(m*n), we can simplify the formula:\n        T_eq ∝ 1 / P^((2/3) * (1/2)) = 1 / P^(1/3)\n    *   This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio:** Now we can write the ratio for Planet_4 and Planet_2 using the relationship derived in the previous step.\n    *   T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (P₄)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)\n    *   This can be rewritten as: T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (P₄ / P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:** The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   The relative period for Planet_2 (P₂) is 2.\n    *   The relative period for Planet_4 (P₄) is 3.5.\n    *   Substitute these values into the formula:\n        T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    *   Simplify the fraction: 2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7.\n    *   Calculate the final value:\n        T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is approximately **0.83**.

The problem statement explicitly provides these conditions.\n*   **Contextual Information:** The mention of the TTV method and orbital resonance is contextual information that explains why such a stable system with simple period ratios might exist. It is not directly needed for the calculation itself.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** Correctly combining the exponents is crucial. The step `(P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3)` is the key to linking the two physical laws.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** A common mistake is to forget that the relationship is inverse. The temperature ratio T₄/T₂ is related to the period ratio P₂/P₄ (note the flipped indices), not P₄/P₂.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All candidate answers correctly derived the physics and performed the calculation, arriving at the numerical result of ~0.83.

When comparing planets that orbit the same star and have the same albedo (reflectivity), as is the case here, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).\n    *   $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law establishes a precise relationship between a planet's orbital period (`P`) and its semi-major axis (`a`). For planets orbiting the same central star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.\n    *   $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n### Step 2: Derive the Relationship Between Temperature and Period\nThe problem gives us information about orbital periods, but the temperature formula uses orbital distance.

This is a clerical error in those responses, not a scientific one. The decision must be based on the options provided in the prompt.\n*   **Key Assumptions:** The solution is dependent on the stated conditions that the planets orbit the same star and possess the same albedo, which simplifies the temperature relationship.\n*   **Correct Ratio Inversion:** A critical step is understanding that the temperature ratio ($T_4/T_2$) is related to the *inverse* of the period ratio ($P_2/P_4$), which was handled correctly in all derivations.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mention of the TTV method and orbital resonance provides a realistic context for the planetary system but is not required for the mathematical solution.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
