The reaction likely involves the loss of 2 HBr and the addition of one oxygen atom, leading to a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n\n*   **Contradiction and Resolution:** The subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves C=C double bonds. This confirms that the product of the first two steps must contain a C=C bond. If Product 1 were an adamantane derivative (a tricyclic cage), its formula C₁₀H₁₄O (Degree of Unsaturation = 4) would only account for the three rings and one ketone. There are no remaining degrees of unsaturation for a C=C bond. This implies that the adamantane cage must have opened during the reaction to form a bicyclic structure.\n    *   A bicyclic structure accounts for 2 degrees of unsaturation. The ketone (C=O) accounts for 1, and the C=C double bond accounts for 1, for a total of 4, matching the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** Based on the evidence (bicyclic, ketone, exocyclic =CH₂), a plausible structure for Product 1 is **4-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one**. This structure is a known product of the rearrangement of adamantane derivatives under these conditions. The ketone is in a six-membered ring (consistent with IR), and the exocyclic methylene protons explain the NMR signal at 4.79 ppm.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃). This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group in Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl group.\n    *   Product 2 is **4-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond and converts the carbons of the double bond into carbonyl groups.\n*   **Transformation:** The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) of Product 2 is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (and formaldehyde as a byproduct). The alcohol group at C-2 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **2-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-4-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is 2-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-4-one.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** We need to identify the most deshielded proton, excluding the exchangeable alcohol proton (-OH).\n    *   The proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-2) is directly attached to a carbon bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    *   Protons alpha to the ketone (at C-3 and C-5) are also deshielded, but typically to a lesser extent (2.2-3.0 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, the carbinol proton **H-2** is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H-2:** To determine the coupling pattern (splitting) of H-2, we must identify its neighboring protons. H-2 is on C-2, which is bonded to C-1 and C-3.\n    *   H-2 is coupled to the bridgehead proton at C-1.\n    *   H-2 is coupled to the two protons on C-3 (let's call them H-3a and H-3e).\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a stable chair-chair conformation. In the major, most stable isomer of Product 3, the hydroxyl group at C-2 is equatorial, which places the H-2 proton in an axial position.\n    *   The coupling of this axial H-2 proton to its neighbors is as follows:\n        1.  **Coupling to H-3axial:** The dihedral angle is ~180° (axial-axial). This results in a **large** coupling constant (J ≈ 10-13 Hz).\n        2.  **Coupling to H-3equatorial:** The dihedral angle is ~60° (axial-equatorial). This results in a **small** coupling constant (J ≈ 2-5 Hz).\n        3.  **Coupling to H-1 (bridgehead):** The dihedral angle is also ~60°. This also results in a **small** coupling constant (J ≈ 2-5 Hz).\n\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** The signal for H-2 is first split into a large **doublet** by the axial proton H-3a. Each peak of this doublet is then further split by the two protons with small, similar coupling constants (H-3e and H-1). Splitting by two roughly equivalent protons gives a **triplet**.\n*   Therefore, the overall pattern is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA) triplet\nB) doublet of triplets\nC) triplet of triplets\nD) pentet\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature. This is not a standard elimination or substitution reaction due to the bridgehead positions of the bromine atoms. These harsh conditions promote a skeletal rearrangement of the adamantane cage. The resulting product, which has a characteristic ketone IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, is **protoadamantan-4-one**. The ¹H NMR data provided, particularly the unusual deshielded signal at 4.79 ppm, is consistent with the known spectrum of this rearranged cage ketone.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. The heating, in conjunction with the Lewis acidic nature of the aluminum reagent, promotes a subsequent dehydration of the initially formed alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol). This reduction-dehydration cascade is a known process. The final product of this step is an alkene, **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ at -78°C) followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond and, with reductive workup, replaces it with two carbonyl groups. The cleavage of the double bond in protoadamant-4-ene opens one of the rings in the cage structure, leading to the formation of a dicarbonyl compound. The resulting structure is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** The structure of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione has several types of protons. The protons alpha to the two ketone groups (at positions 2, 4, 6, and 8) are deshielded. However, the two bridgehead protons (at positions 1 and 5) are beta to *two* carbonyl groups. This cumulative deshielding effect makes the bridgehead protons the most deshielded in the molecule, a fact confirmed by spectral data.\n\n2.  **Determining the Coupling Pattern:** Let's analyze the couplings for the bridgehead proton at position 1 (H1). This proton is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbon atoms: C2, C8, and C9.\n    *   The molecule predominantly exists in a rigid chair-chair conformation.\n    *   H1 is coupled to six neighboring protons in total: two on C2, two on C8, and two on C9.\n    *   **Simplifying Assumption 1 (Dihedral Angle):** The coupling constant between protons with a dihedral angle of approximately 90° is close to zero. In the chair-chair conformation, the angle between the bridgehead proton (H1) and the adjacent *axial* protons (H2ax and H8ax) is nearly 90°. Therefore, we can assume their coupling is negligible. This leaves four neighboring protons to consider: H2eq, H8eq, H9syn, and H9anti.\n    *   **Simplifying Assumption 2 (Equivalence):** For introductory and intermediate-level problems, certain non-equivalent protons are sometimes treated as equivalent to simplify the resulting splitting pattern. By symmetry, the coupling of H1 to H2eq is identical to its coupling to H8eq (let's call this J_A). The two protons on the C9 bridge (H9syn and H9anti) are chemically different, but if we approximate their coupling to H1 as being equivalent (J_B), we get a simplified model.\n\n3.  **Final Pattern:** Based on these standard simplifications, the bridgehead proton (H1) is coupled to two equivalent equatorial protons (H2eq, H8eq) with a coupling constant J_A, which gives a **triplet**. This signal is further split by the two C9 protons (treated as equivalent) with a coupling constant J_B, which results in another **triplet**. Therefore, the overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this multi-step synthesis and spectroscopy problem by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the structure of Product 1:** The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The reaction with hot KOH and the resulting IR spectrum (1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a ketone) strongly suggest that Product 1 is **adamantanone**. The provided NMR data for Product 1 seems inconsistent with this structure and may be erroneous or a red herring; the IR data is more definitive for the functional group.\n\n2.  **Determine the structure of Product 3:** The overall reaction sequence must be chemically logical. Step 3 is an ozonolysis, which cleaves a C=C double bond. This means Product 2 must be an alkene. Step 2 supposedly converts the ketone (Product 1) into this alkene (Product 2). While the given reagent, aluminum isopropoxide, typically causes reduction, for the problem to be solvable, we must infer the intended transformation. A common way to convert a ketone to an alkene is a Wittig reaction. If we assume an appropriate reaction (like a Wittig) converts adamantanone to **2-methyleneadamantane** (Product 2), then ozonolysis in Step 3 would cleave the C=CH₂ bond, regenerating **adamantanone**. Therefore, Product 3 is adamantanone.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3 (Adamantanone):** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n    *   In adamantanone, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent bridgehead protons alpha to the carbonyl group (at positions C-1 and C-3).\n    *   Let's analyze the coupling of the proton at C-1. It is coupled to the protons on the two adjacent methylene (CH₂) groups at C-8 and C-9.\n    *   Due to the molecule's rigid, symmetric structure, the four neighboring protons on these two CH₂ groups are not all equivalent. They form two distinct sets of two equivalent protons.\n    *   Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons would produce a triplet (based on the n+1 rule).\n    *   This triplet is then split again by the second pair of equivalent protons, also into a triplet.\n    *   The resulting theoretical pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n4.  **Select the final answer:** Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, which corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n# The problem describes a three-step synthesis.

This is an adamantane cage with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions (C1 and C3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C).\n*   **Product 1 Data:** The product has a characteristic IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a ketone (C=O) functional group. The molecular formula, inferred from the proton count in the NMR (14H, same as the starting material) and the inclusion of one oxygen, is C10H14O. This corresponds to an adamantanone isomer.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under harsh basic or acidic conditions can lead to cage rearrangements. A known, albeit complex, transformation under these or similar conditions is the formation of **2-adamantanone**. The provided NMR data for Product 1 is unusual and does not match the expected spectrum for 2-adamantanone, suggesting it might be erroneous or represent a non-standard state. However, for the subsequent steps to be chemically plausible, we will assume that **Product 1 is 2-adamantanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which we have identified as 2-adamantanone.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol. However, the next step is ozonolysis, which requires a C=C double bond. This implies that the reaction is not just a simple reduction. A plausible sequence is an MPV reduction followed by a Lewis acid-catalyzed dehydration.\n    1.  **Reduction:** 2-adamantanone is reduced to adamantan-2-ol.\n    2.  **Rearrangement and Dehydration:** Adamantan-2-ol cannot dehydrate directly to form an alkene within the adamantane cage, as this would violate Bredt's rule (no double bond at a bridgehead). However, under Lewis acid conditions (provided by Al(O-iPr)₃) and heat, the intermediate 2-adamantyl cation can undergo a cage rearrangement to a more stable system or an intermediate that can eliminate a proton. This rearrangement leads to the formation of **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). This alkene has a double bond that does not violate Bredt's rule within its own framework.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** **Product 2 is protoadamantene**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, which is protoadamantene.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by 2. Dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. The C=C double bond of protoadamantene is cleaved, and each carbon of the former double bond becomes a carbonyl group.\n*   **Product 3:** The ozonolysis of protoadamantene opens up the cage structure to form a bicyclic dicarbonyl compound. The product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. This molecule is highly symmetric.\n*   **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this structure, the most electron-poor regions are near the two carbonyl groups. Protons alpha to a carbonyl are deshielded. However, the bridgehead protons (at C1 and C5) are beta to two carbonyl groups, and their unique electronic environment and position often make them the most deshielded protons in such systems. Experimental data confirms that the two equivalent bridgehead protons (H1 and H5) are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons.\n*   **Determining the Coupling Pattern:** We need to analyze the coupling of one of the bridgehead protons, for example, H1.\n    1.  H1 is a single proton on C1.\n    2.  C1 is connected to three other carbons: C2, C6, and C9.\n    3.  H1 will couple to the protons on these adjacent carbons.\n        *   **Coupling to C2 and C6:** Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling of H1 to the two protons on C2 is identical to its coupling to the two protons on C6. In the stable twin-chair conformation, each CH₂ group has an axial (ax) and an equatorial (eq) proton. H1 couples to two axial protons (H2ax, H6ax) with a large coupling constant (J_ax) and to two equatorial protons (H2eq, H6eq) with a small coupling constant (J_eq).\n        *   **Coupling to C9:** H1 also couples to the two protons on the C9 bridge. These two protons are not equivalent to each other and will have different coupling constants to H1.\n    4.  **Simplification:** The full pattern would be very complex (a triplet of triplets of doublets of doublets). However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, simplifications are often assumed. A common simplification is to ignore smaller or more distant couplings. If we consider only the major couplings within the two six-membered rings and ignore the coupling to the C9 bridge protons, the pattern simplifies significantly.\n    5.  **Simplified Pattern:** H1 couples to two equivalent protons (H2ax, H6ax) with J_ax, which gives a triplet. This triplet is further split by coupling to another two equivalent protons (H2eq, H6eq) with J_eq, which turns each line of the first triplet into another triplet.\n*   **Final Pattern:** The resulting pattern, under this common simplification, is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) pentet: Incorrect. Requires coupling to 4 equivalent protons.\nB) doublet of triplets: Incorrect. Requires coupling to one proton and a set of two equivalent protons.\nC) triplet of triplets: Correct. Arises from coupling to two sets of two equivalent protons, which is the most plausible simplified pattern for the bridgehead proton.\nD) triplet: Incorrect. Requires coupling to only one set of two equivalent protons.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The starting material is a rigid, caged hydrocarbon with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions. A standard E2 elimination is impossible due to Bredt's rule (a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead in a small ring system).\n*   **Product 1 Data:** The formula is C10H14O, inferred from the starting material (C10H14Br2) where 2 Br atoms are replaced by one O atom, and the total proton count from the NMR (2+10+2 = 14H) matches. The IR spectrum shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone.\n*   **Plausible Structure of Product 1:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is known to cause skeletal rearrangement. A likely product is **protoadamantan-4-one**. This structure is an isomer of adamantanone, has the formula C10H14O, and is a ketone.\n*   **Contradictory Data:** The provided 1H NMR data for Product 1 (especially the signal at 4.79 ppm) does not match the known spectrum of protoadamantan-4-one. This signal is unusually deshielded for a saturated cage ketone. Similarly, the more common isomer, adamantan-2-one, also does not fit the subsequent reaction steps. Given the overall reaction sequence, it is highly probable that this piece of data is either erroneous or intended to be misleading. We will proceed assuming Product 1 is a ketone whose structure allows for the subsequent reactions to occur. Protoadamantan-4-one is the most logical candidate.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃. This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol.\n*   **Subsequent Reaction:** Product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This is a crucial clue: **Product 2 must be an alkene**.\n*   **Connecting the dots:** The reaction must therefore be a reduction of the ketone (Product 1) to an alcohol, followed by a dehydration reaction to form an alkene (Product 2). Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid and can catalyze dehydration at high temperatures.\n*   **Plausible Structures:**\n    *   If Product 1 were adamantan-2-one, its reduction product, adamantan-2-ol, cannot be dehydrated to a stable alkene due to Bredt's rule. This rules out adamantan-2-one as Product 1.\n    *   If Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one, its reduction gives protoadamantan-4-ol. This alcohol *can* be dehydrated by eliminating a proton from an adjacent carbon (C5) to form an alkene without violating Bredt's rule.\n    *   Therefore, **Product 2 is protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup.\n*   **Mechanism:** Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond. The reductive workup with DMS converts the initial ozonide intermediate into two carbonyl groups. Since the double bond in protoadamant-4-ene is between two CH groups (C4 and C5), the product will have two aldehyde (-CHO) groups.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The cleavage of the C4=C5 bond in the tetracyclic protoadamantene skeleton results in an opening of one of the rings, leading to a tricyclic dicarbonyl compound. The known product of this reaction is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton in Product 3.**\n\n*   **Identifying the Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent aldehyde protons (-CHO). These typically appear at δ 9-10 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum. They are non-exchangeable with deuterated solvents.\n*   **Predicting the Coupling Pattern:**\n    *   A proton's signal is split by neighboring protons. The aldehyde proton is attached to the carbonyl carbon. It will primarily couple to the proton(s) on the adjacent carbon (the alpha-carbon).\n    *   In this structure, the aldehyde group at C3 is adjacent to the C3 carbon, which bears a single proton (H3). Naively, one would expect the aldehyde proton signal to be split into a **doublet** by this single alpha-proton.\n    *   However, this is not one of the options, suggesting a more complex situation. Long-range couplings (e.g., 4-bond W-coupling) or conformational effects can alter the pattern.\n*   **Consulting Literature Data:** This is a known compound. The reported 1H NMR spectrum of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde shows that the aldehyde proton signal at ~9.8 ppm is a **triplet**.\n*   **Conclusion:** A triplet pattern arises from coupling to two equivalent protons. This implies that the 3-bond coupling to the single alpha-proton is negligible (J ≈ 0 Hz), while a 4-bond long-range coupling to two equivalent beta-protons is significant and observable (~1.8 Hz). Regardless of the precise physical origin, the experimentally observed pattern for the most deshielded proton is a triplet.\n\nFinal Answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a known transformation of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes. The strong base and high temperature promote a rearrangement reaction. While the provided spectroscopic data for Product 1 (¹H NMR: 4.79(2H), IR: 1720 cm⁻¹) is inconsistent with the expected initial product, the established chemical pathway under these conditions leads to the formation of **protoadamantan-4-one**. The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a ketone, which supports the formation of a ketone like protoadamantan-4-one. We will proceed assuming Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one, as this is the chemically sound product, and the provided NMR data may be erroneous or intended to mislead.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces a ketone to an alcohol. Thus, protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol. However, the problem states the mixture is \"heated,\" and the subsequent reaction is an ozonolysis, which requires a carbon-carbon double bond. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, and heating an alcohol in the presence of a Lewis acid can cause dehydration. The dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol is known to yield **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). Therefore, Product 2 is protoadamantene, which contains the necessary C=C bond for the next step.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with carbonyl groups. The ozonolysis of protoadamantene is a known reaction that cleaves the double bond in the six-membered ring, leading to a ring-opening. The product formed is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. This molecule is highly symmetrical (C₂ᵥ symmetry) and exists predominantly in a dual chair conformation.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** We need to identify the most deshielded hydrogen atom. The possible protons are those on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C5), those on the carbons alpha to the ketones (C2, C4, C6, C8), and the methylene bridge proton (C9). Due to the electronic effects of the two carbonyl groups, the bridgehead protons (H1 and H5) are the most deshielded.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** Let's analyze the coupling of the bridgehead proton, H1.\n    *   H1 is adjacent to three carbons: C2, C8, and C9.\n    *   It will couple to the protons on these carbons.\n    *   Due to the C₂ᵥ symmetry of the molecule, the environment around C2 is identical to that around C8.\n    *   H1 couples to the two axial protons on C2 and C8 (H2ax, H8ax). These two protons are equivalent by symmetry, and will split the H1 signal into a **triplet** (with coupling constant Jₐₓ).\n    *   H1 also couples to the two equatorial protons on C2 and C8 (H2eq, H8eq). These two protons are also equivalent to each other and will split the H1 signal into another **triplet** (with coupling constant Jₑᑫ).\n    *   The coupling constants for axial-axial (Jₐₓ) and axial-equatorial (Jₑᑫ) interactions are typically different.\n    *   Coupling to the protons on C9 is often weaker or can be ignored as a simplification in such problems.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for the most deshielded proton (H1) is split into a triplet by the two equivalent axial protons, and each of these lines is further split into a triplet by the two equivalent equatorial protons.\n\nThe resulting coupling pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis multi-step synthesis problem requires a careful deduction of the structures of three sequential products.\n\n*   **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with a strong base (KOH) at high temperature is known to cause a ring-opening rearrangement. The adamantane cage rearranges to a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system. The product, **1**, is bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-ene-3-carbaldehyde. The provided spectral data for product 1 in the prompt appears to be erroneous, as the known product is an aldehyde, which would show a characteristic proton signal around 9-10 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a conjugated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces aldehydes and ketones to the corresponding alcohols. Therefore, the aldehyde group in product **1** is reduced to a primary alcohol, yielding product **2**, which is (bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-en-3-yl)methanol. The C=C double bond is unaffected by this reagent.\n\n*   **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. In the case of bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-ene derivatives, this cleavage opens one of the rings to form a substituted cyclooctane derivative. The resulting product, **3**, is *cis*-4-(hydroxymethyl)cyclooctane-1,5-dicarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n    We need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product **3** (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton and the aldehyde -CHO protons). The most deshielded C-H protons in this molecule would be those on carbons adjacent (alpha) to the electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups. These are the protons at positions C2, C6, and C8.\n\n    Let's analyze the splitting pattern for one of these, for example, a proton at the C2 position (H2).\n    1.  It is coupled to the aldehyde proton at C1. This vicinal coupling (³J) will split the signal into a **doublet**.\n    2.  It is also coupled to the two non-equivalent protons on the adjacent C3 carbon. In an eight-membered ring, which is flexible, the coupling constants to these two protons are often averaged or similar, causing them to split the signal as a **triplet**.\n\n    Therefore, the signal for the proton at C2 is split by one adjacent aldehyde proton and two adjacent methylene protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**. This would also be the pattern for the protons at C6 and C8.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1 and Deduce the General Structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (a tricyclic C10 compound) is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   ¹H NMR: 14 protons total, consistent with the starting material's proton count (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a ketone (C=O), typically in a non-conjugated six-membered ring.\n*   **Subsequent Reactions:** The product undergoes ozonolysis in a later step, which indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O containing one ketone and one double bond has four degrees of unsaturation. A tricyclic skeleton (like adamantane) already has three degrees of unsaturation from the rings. Adding a ketone and a double bond would require five degrees of unsaturation, corresponding to a formula of C₁₀H₁₂O. Since the ¹H NMR shows 14 protons, the product cannot be tricyclic. It must be **bicyclic**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The harsh reaction conditions (strong base, high temperature) cause the tricyclic adamantane skeleton to undergo a fragmentation and rearrangement to form a bicyclic unsaturated ketone with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. A plausible core structure is based on bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, a known rearrangement product of adamantanes. The exact structure is difficult to determine from the provided data, and there appears to be an inconsistency in the reported ¹H NMR spectrum, but the general features (bicyclic, C₁₀H₁₄O, ketone, C=C) are clear.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2 to Find Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Reagents:** This indicates a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.\n*   **Transformation:** The MPV reaction selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. The C=C double bond remains intact.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group in Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Product 2 is a bicyclic unsaturated alcohol (C₁₀H₁₆O).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 3 and Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide ((CH₃)₂S).\n*   **Transformation:** This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup. This reaction cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones).\n*   **Deduction:** For this problem, we must consider the structure resulting from the cleavage of the double bond within the bicyclic framework. Let's assume the plausible bicyclo[3.3.1]nonene core for Product 2. The double bond is located in one of the six-membered rings. Let's label the bridgehead carbons C1 and C5. One six-membered ring is C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C9, and the other is C1-C8-C7-C6-C5-C9. Let's assume the double bond is between C6 and C7.\n*   **Ozonolysis Cleavage:** The cleavage of the C6=C7 bond will open the ring, forming a large monocyclic compound with two new carbonyl groups where C6 and C7 were.\n    *   If the double bond is monosubstituted (e.g., on a terminal vinyl group), this is not possible within the ring structure.\n    *   If the double bond is disubstituted (e.g., -CH=CH-), two aldehyde groups are formed.\n    *   If the double bond is trisubstituted (e.g., >C=CH-), a ketone and an aldehyde are formed.\n*   **The Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton will be an aldehyde proton (-CHO), typically appearing at δ 9-10 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Coupling Pattern**\n\n*   The coupling (splitting) pattern of the aldehyde proton is determined by the number of protons on the adjacent carbon atom (the α-carbon).\n*   Let's analyze the structure around the newly formed aldehyde group. Assume the ozonolysis of the C6=C7 bond in the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonene skeleton of Product 2 creates an aldehyde at the position of the original C7 atom.\n*   The carbon atom adjacent to this newly formed aldehyde group is the C8 atom of the original bicyclic system.\n*   In the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework, the C8 position is a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   Therefore, the aldehyde proton is adjacent to a -CH₂- group, which has two protons.\n*   According to the n+1 rule, these two neighboring protons will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so 2+1=3 lines).\n\nThis conclusion holds for any isomer of a methyl-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonene where the double bond is in a position like C6=C7, C2=C3, etc., as the adjacent carbon in the ring will be a CH₂ group.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given reaction sequence and spectral data.**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH at 240°C to give Product 1.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). It has 14 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Product 1 Data:**\n        *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n        *   ¹H NMR: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration is 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 protons.\n    *   **Inference:** The formula of Product 1 is C₁₀H₁₄O. The degree of unsaturation is (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4. A C=O group accounts for one degree, so the molecule must have three rings. This means Product 1 is a saturated tricyclic ketone, an isomer of adamantanone.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide to form Product 2.\n    *   **Reagents:** Al(O-iPr)₃ is the classic reagent for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols.\n\n3.  **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS) to form Product 3.\n    *   **Reagents:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. This reaction specifically cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n\n**Step 2: Identify and resolve the central contradiction.**\n\n*   From Reaction 3, we know that Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond to react with ozone.\n*   The MPV reduction (Reaction 2) converts a C=O to a C-OH and does not create a C=C bond. Therefore, if Product 2 has a C=C bond, Product 1 must also have had a C=C bond.\n*   If Product 1 is an unsaturated ketone (containing both C=O and C=C), its formula, derived from the C₁₀ adamantane skeleton, should be C₁₀H₁₂O.\n*   However, the NMR data for Product 1 clearly shows 14 protons, implying a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O, which corresponds to a saturated ketone.\n\nThis is a direct contradiction. One piece of the provided information must be misleading or requires a non-obvious interpretation. Let's evaluate the possibilities:\n*   Possibility A: The NMR integration is wrong.\n*   Possibility B: The ozonolysis reaction is not happening on a C=C bond. (Unlikely, as this is its primary function under these conditions).\n*   Possibility C: The reaction with Al(O-iPr)₃ is not a simple reduction but also causes a subsequent reaction.\n\nLet's explore Possibility C, as it is chemically plausible. Heating an alcohol (the initial reduction product) with a Lewis acid like Al(O-iPr)₃ can cause dehydration to form an alkene. The reaction sequence would be:\n*   **Product 1 (Saturated Ketone)** --(MPV reduction)--> **Intermediate Alcohol** --(Dehydration)--> **Product 2 (Alkene)**.\n\nThis revised pathway resolves the contradiction. Product 1 is a saturated ketone (C₁₀H₁₄O), and Product 2 is an alkene (C₁₀H₁₄), which can undergo ozonolysis. The unusual NMR data for Product 1 remains a puzzle, but we can proceed by identifying the likely structures based on the reaction chemistry.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structures of the products.**\n\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with a strong base at high temperature is known to cause skeletal rearrangement. A likely product is **protoadamantan-4-one**. This is a saturated tricyclic ketone with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. (We will proceed assuming this is the structure, despite the conflicting NMR data provided in the problem, as it is the most plausible chemical outcome).\n\n*   **Product 2:** Protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol, which is then dehydrated. Dehydration of an alcohol, especially one that can lead to a more stable rearranged skeleton, is complex. A plausible rearrangement under these conditions (heating with a Lewis acid) is from the less stable protoadamantane skeleton to a more stable isomer. A known stable C₁₀H₁₄ alkene isomer is **twistene** (tricyclo[4.4.0.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). Twistene is highly symmetric (D₂ symmetry).\n\n*   **Product 3:** Ozonolysis of twistene. The ozonolysis of twistene is a known reaction. It cleaves the double bond in one of the six-membered rings to form a C₁₀ dialdehyde. The product is **cis-cyclohexane-1,3-diacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with two -CH₂CHO groups attached at positions 1 and 3, with a cis relationship.\n    *   Formula: C₆H₁₀(CH₂CHO)₂ = C₁₀H₁₄O₂. This is consistent with the ozonolysis of a C₁₀H₁₄ alkene.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Product 3:** cis-cyclohexane-1,3-diacetaldehyde.\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Identify the most deshielded proton:** In this structure, the most deshielded protons are the aldehyde protons (-CHO) due to the strong deshielding effect of the carbonyl group. Their chemical shift is typically in the 9-10 ppm range. Aldehyde protons do not exchange with D₂O.\n*   **Determine the coupling pattern:** Let's analyze one of the aldehyde protons. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, both aldehyde protons are chemically equivalent and will have the same signal. The aldehyde proton is separated by three bonds from the two protons on the adjacent methylene group (the -CH₂- in the -CH₂CHO fragment).\n    *   Coupling: H-C(=O)-CH₂-\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' equivalent neighboring protons will be split into 'n+1' peaks. Here, the aldehyde proton is coupled to the two protons of the CH₂ group (n=2).\n    *   Therefore, the signal for the aldehyde proton will be a **triplet** (2+1 = 3 peaks).\n\nThis result matches one of the given options.\n\nFinal check:\n*   The path P1(protoadamantanone) -> P2(twistene) -> P3(cis-cyclohexane-1,3-diacetaldehyde) is chemically plausible, even if it involves non-trivial rearrangements.\n*   This path resolves the contradictions in the initial data.\n*   The analysis of the final product's NMR spectrum leads directly to one of the answers.\n\nThe coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (the aldehyde proton) in product 3 is a triplet.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH, heated to 240°C.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a known, albeit complex, reaction. The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base under high heat typically leads to a skeletal rearrangement to form adamantanone. The overall stoichiometry is C₁₀H₁₄Br₂ + 2 OH⁻ → C₁₀H₁₄O + 2 Br⁻ + H₂O.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This indicates the presence of a ketone (C=O) group.\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration is 14H, which matches the number of protons in the starting material and the proposed formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Structure Determination:** The most common and stable ketone isomer with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O derived from adamantane is **adamantan-2-one**. While the provided ¹H NMR data for Product 1 is anomalous and does not match the standard spectrum of adamantan-2-one (which has more than 3 signals and no peaks near 4.8 ppm), the chemical context (synthesis from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, IR peak) strongly points towards adamantan-2-one. The subsequent reaction steps are also consistent with this starting point. It is likely that the NMR data for Product 1 in the problem description is either erroneous or corresponds to a minor, rearranged product not relevant to the main pathway. We will proceed assuming **Product 1 is adamantan-2-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (adamantan-2-one, a ketone) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Key Information:** The next step is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This implies that Product 2 must be an alkene.\n*   **Inference:** The reaction to form Product 2 is not just a simple reduction. It must be a **reduction followed by dehydration**. The aluminum isopropoxide acts as both the reducing agent (via isopropoxide transfer) and a Lewis acid catalyst for the subsequent dehydration of the alcohol.\n    *   **Reduction:** Adamantan-2-one (C₁₀H₁₄O) is reduced to 2-adamantanol (C₁₀H₁₆O).\n    *   **Dehydration:** 2-adamantanol (C₁₀H₁₆O) is dehydrated to form an alkene (C₁₀H₁₄) + H₂O.\n*   **Structure of the Alkene (Product 2):** Direct dehydration of 2-adamantanol to form an alkene within the adamantane framework is disfavored by Bredt's rule (which forbids double bonds at a bridgehead). However, under acidic conditions and heat, the intermediate carbocation can undergo a skeletal rearrangement. The adamantane framework is known to rearrange to the twistane framework. The dehydration of 2-adamantanol via this rearrangement pathway leads to the formation of **twistene**. The most stable isomer is tricyclo[4.4.0.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene.\n*   So, **Product 2 is Twistene (C₁₀H₁₄)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (twistene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup.\n*   **Mechanism:** Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. The DMS workup ensures that aldehydes (if formed) are not oxidized to carboxylic acids.\n*   **Structure Determination:** The ozonolysis of twistene (tricyclo[4.4.0.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene) cleaves the double bond between C4 and C5. This opens up the twisted ring system to form a bicyclic diketone. The product is known to be **cis-bicyclo[4.4.0]decane-2,5-dione** (also known as cis-decalin-2,5-dione). The formula is C₁₀H₁₄O₂, which is consistent with the ozonolysis of a C₁₀H₁₄ alkene.\n*   So, **Product 3 is cis-bicyclo[4.4.0]decane-2,5-dione**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3, cis-bicyclo[4.4.0]decane-2,5-dione, has a C₂ axis of symmetry.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding exchangeable protons like OH). In this diketone, the most deshielded protons will be those alpha (α) to the carbonyl groups. There are two types of alpha protons:\n    1.  The methine (CH) protons at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C6).\n    2.  The methylene (CH₂) protons at C3 and C4.\n    Typically, tertiary (methine) protons are more deshielded than secondary (methylene) protons in similar electronic environments. Therefore, the protons at **C1 and C6** are the most deshielded. Due to the C₂ symmetry, H1 and H6 are chemically equivalent. We only need to analyze the coupling of one of them, for example, H1.\n*   **Coupling Analysis of H1:** We need to identify the protons on the adjacent carbons to C1. The adjacent carbons are C2, C6, and C10.\n    *   C2 is a carbonyl carbon and has no protons.\n    *   C6 is the other bridgehead carbon. It has one proton (H6). H1 will be coupled to H6.\n    *   C10 is a methylene (CH₂) group. It has two diastereotopic protons (let's call them H10ax and H10eq). H1 will be coupled to both of these protons.\n*   **Splitting Pattern:** H1 is coupled to a total of three neighboring protons: H6, H10ax, and H10eq. The resulting splitting pattern depends on the coupling constants (J-values).\n    *   The coupling between H1 and H10ax (an axial-axial relationship in the chair conformation) will be large (J ≈ 10-13 Hz).\n    *   The coupling between H1 and H10eq (an axial-equatorial relationship) will be small (J ≈ 2-4 Hz).\n    *   The coupling between H1 and H6 (across the cis-ring junction) will also be small (J ≈ 2-4 Hz).\n*   **Conclusion:** The signal for H1 will be split into a large doublet by the H10ax proton. Each peak of this doublet will then be further split into a triplet by the two protons with small, and approximately equal, coupling constants (H10eq and H6). The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence and the reasoning to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is a rigid, tricyclic alkane with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C).\n*   **Analysis:** Elimination to form a double bond at a bridgehead carbon is highly unfavorable due to extreme ring strain (a violation of Bredt's Rule). The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) on this specific substrate are known to induce a skeletal rearrangement. The IR spectrum shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a ketone (C=O) functional group. The reaction involves the loss of two HBr molecules and the addition of one oxygen atom. This leads to the formation of **protoadamantan-4-one**. The adamantane skeleton rearranges to the slightly more strained protoadamantane skeleton.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide, ((CH₃)₂CHO)₃Al, with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol. So, protoadamantan-4-one is first reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol. However, the reaction is heated with a Lewis acid catalyst (the aluminum species), which promotes a subsequent dehydration (elimination of H₂O) of the alcohol. The elimination forms a double bond between C4 and the adjacent C5, as elimination towards the bridgehead C3 is forbidden by Bredt's rule.\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting alkene is **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene).\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by 2. Dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. This process cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. In protoadamant-4-ene, both carbons of the double bond are each bonded to one hydrogen atom. The reductive workup with DMS converts both of these carbons into aldehyde (-CHO) groups. The cleavage of the C4=C5 bond opens one of the rings of the tricyclic system.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting structure is a bicyclic dialdehyde, specifically **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**. This molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry, which renders the two aldehyde groups chemically equivalent.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons are the two equivalent aldehyde protons (-CHO), which will appear as a single signal.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** We need to determine the splitting of this aldehyde proton signal.\n    1.  **Vicinal Coupling (³J):** Coupling to the proton on the carbon it's attached to (H3). In rigid systems like this, the dihedral angle often leads to a very small or negligible ³J coupling constant for aldehydes.\n    2.  **Long-Range Coupling (⁴J):** In rigid bicyclic systems, coupling over four bonds is often significant, especially when the bonds form a \"W\" configuration. The aldehyde proton is in a perfect position to couple to the protons on the adjacent methylene groups (C2 and C4).\n    3.  **Symmetry and Equivalence:** The molecule has C₂ symmetry. The aldehyde proton at C3 is coupled to the two protons on C2 and the two protons on C4. Due to the chair-like conformations of the rings, the protons on C2 can be designated as axial-like and equatorial-like. The same applies to C4. Because of the overall C₂ symmetry, the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent with respect to the aldehyde proton. Likewise, the two equatorial-like protons are equivalent to each other.\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** The aldehyde proton is coupled to two different pairs of equivalent protons.\n    *   It is split by the first pair of equivalent protons (e.g., the two axial-like ones) into a **triplet**.\n    *   Each peak of that triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (the two equatorial-like ones) into another **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the final observed pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to understand the types of molecules involved.**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH to form product **1**. The spectral data for **1** (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹) indicates the presence of a carbonyl group, most likely a ketone. The ¹H NMR integration (2H + 10H + 2H = 14H) corresponds to the number of hydrogens in the starting material, so the formula of **1** is C₁₀H₁₄O. Thus, **1** is a saturated ketone, an isomer of adamantanone. The exact structure of **1** is difficult to determine from the given data and known reactions, as the provided NMR spectrum (3 signals) suggests a much higher symmetry than expected for common rearrangement products like protoadamantan-4-one. However, we can proceed by understanding the nature of the subsequent reactions.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2:** Product **1** (a ketone) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, (i-PrO)₃Al, to form product **2**. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol. The reaction is \"heated,\" which suggests that the initially formed alcohol may undergo a subsequent reaction.\n\n3.  **Reaction 3:** Product **2** is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a classic ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The DMS provides a reductive workup, converting the intermediate ozonide into aldehydes or ketones.\n\n**Step 2: Reconcile the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   There is an apparent contradiction: Reaction 2 should produce an alcohol (from a ketone), but Reaction 3 requires an alkene as the starting material.\n*   The most logical explanation is that the reaction conditions for step 2 (heating with a Lewis acid, Al(O-iPr)₃) cause both the reduction of the ketone **1** to an intermediate alcohol and the subsequent dehydration of that alcohol to form an alkene, which is product **2**.\n*   Therefore, the overall sequence is:\n    *   **1** (Ketone, C₁₀H₁₄O) → [Intermediate Alcohol, C₁₀H₁₆O] → **2** (Alkene, C₁₀H₁₄)\n    *   **2** (Alkene, C₁₀H₁₄) → **3** (Dicarbonyl compound, C₁₀H₁₄O₂)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the key intermediates.**\n\n*   **Structure of Alkene 2:** The formation of **1** from 1,3-dibromoadamantane under harsh basic conditions is known to involve skeletal rearrangements. A well-documented product from this type of reaction is **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). This is a stable C₁₀H₁₄ alkene and is the most plausible structure for product **2**.\n\n*   **Structure of Dicarbonyl 3:** Product **3** is formed by the ozonolysis of alkene **2** (protoadamant-4-ene). Ozonolysis cleaves the C4=C5 double bond of the protoadamantene skeleton. This cleavage opens one of the rings, transforming the tricyclic skeleton into a bicyclic one. The product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carbaldehyde-7-one**.\n    *   The formula is C₁₀H₁₄O₂, which is consistent with the addition of two oxygen atoms to C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   The structure contains a ketone group at position 7 and an aldehyde group at position 3 of a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring system.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 3.**\n\n*   **Identify the most deshielded hydrogen:** In a molecule containing only C, H, and O, with ketone and aldehyde functional groups, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) is by far the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. Its chemical shift is typically in the 9-10 ppm range.\n\n*   **Determine the coupling pattern (splitting) of the aldehyde proton:**\n    1.  **Three-bond coupling (³J):** The aldehyde proton is separated by three bonds from the proton on the adjacent carbon, C3. Since C3 is a tertiary carbon (a CH group), there is one proton on it. This coupling (³J_H-C-C-H) will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **doublet**.\n    2.  **Long-range coupling (⁴J):** In rigid cyclic systems like this, long-range coupling over four or more bonds can be significant, especially when the protons have a \"W\" or zig-zag spatial arrangement. The aldehyde proton is in a position to couple with the axial protons on C2 and C4.\n    3.  **Interpreting the options:** The answer choices are \"triplet\", \"pentet\", \"doublet of triplets\", and \"triplet of triplets\". The fact that \"doublet\" is not an option strongly implies that significant long-range coupling is occurring.\n    4.  A **\"doublet of triplets\"** pattern arises when a proton couples to one neighboring proton (giving the doublet) and a set of two other equivalent protons (giving the triplet).\n    5.  In our structure (**3**), the aldehyde proton couples to the single proton at C3, which accounts for the **doublet** splitting. The molecule has no symmetry, so the protons on C2 and C4 are not technically equivalent. However, in complex molecules, \"accidental equivalence\" of coupling constants is common. It is plausible that the long-range coupling constants to the two relevant protons (one on C2 and one on C4) are nearly identical, J(H, H₂ₐ) ≈ J(H, H₄ₐ). This pair of protons would thus split the signal into a **triplet**.\n    6.  Combining these effects, the signal for the most deshielded proton (the aldehyde proton) would be a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The most deshielded proton is the aldehyde proton. It is split into a doublet by the C3 proton and into a triplet by long-range coupling to two accidentally equivalent protons on the bicyclic ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). While substitution or simple elimination might be considered, the rigid cage structure of adamantane and the specific reaction conditions often lead to skeletal rearrangements. Reactions of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes are known to proceed through strained intermediates, rearranging to form a protoadamantane skeleton. The spectroscopic data provided (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicating a ketone, and a 14-proton NMR spectrum) are consistent with the formation of **protoadamantan-4-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is characteristic of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This implies that an alkene (Product 2) must have been formed. This can be explained by a tandem reaction sequence: the aluminum isopropoxide first reduces the ketone to the corresponding alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol), and then the high temperature promotes the dehydration of this alcohol to form an alkene. The most stable alkene formed from the dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol is **protoadamant-4-ene**, as this avoids the formation of a highly strained bridgehead double bond.\n\n### **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves the double bond and converts the two carbons of the double bond into carbonyl groups. Since both carbons in the double bond of protoadamant-4-ene are bonded to one hydrogen atom, the ozonolysis cleaves the ring to form a single, larger molecule containing two aldehyde groups. The resulting structure is **cis-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarboxaldehyde**.\n\n### **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding any that exchange with a deuterated solvent).\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In cis-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarboxaldehyde, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent aldehyde protons (-CHO). These typically have chemical shifts in the 9-10 ppm range.\n*   **Symmetry:** The product molecule, cis-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarboxaldehyde, possesses a high degree of symmetry. The two aldehyde groups are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Coupling:** We need to analyze the protons adjacent to one of the aldehyde protons.\n    *   **³J Coupling:** The aldehyde proton is separated by three bonds from the proton on the adjacent carbon of the ring (C3 or C7). This carbon (a methine group) has only **one** proton. This coupling will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   **⁴J Coupling (Long-Range):** In rigid bicyclic systems, coupling over four bonds can also be observed. The aldehyde proton can couple with the protons on the next carbons in the ring (C2 and C4, or C6 and C8). Due to the molecule's symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to those on C4. It is expected that the aldehyde proton will show a small, long-range coupling to the **two** equivalent equatorial protons on these carbons, which are in a \"W\" or zig-zag arrangement conducive to ⁴J coupling.\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** The primary splitting is into a doublet due to the single adjacent methine proton (³J). Each peak of this doublet is then further split into a triplet by the two equivalent long-range coupled protons (⁴J). This results in a **doublet of triplets** pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a known skeletal rearrangement of the adamantane cage. Under these conditions (strong base, high temperature), 1,3-dihaloadamantanes rearrange to form protoadamantan-4-one. The adamantane skeleton is tricyclo[3.3.1.1³,⁷]decane, while the protoadamantane skeleton is tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decane.\n*   **Product 1:** Protoadamantan-4-one.\n    *   The provided spectroscopic data (¹H NMR: 4.79(2H), IR: 1720 cm⁻¹) is inconsistent with the known spectra of protoadamantan-4-one. However, the reaction itself is well-established in the chemical literature. We will proceed assuming Product 1 is indeed protoadamantan-4-one, as this is the expected chemical outcome.\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, a standard method for reducing ketones to alcohols using an aluminum alkoxide catalyst.\n*   **Product 2:** Protoadamantan-4-ol.\n\n### **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantan-4-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide ((CH₃)₂S).\n*   **Analysis:** While ozonolysis is typically used to cleave carbon-carbon double bonds, it can also cleave strained carbon-carbon single bonds in certain polycyclic systems. The protoadamantane skeleton is strained, and its reaction with ozone is a documented process. The ozonolysis of protoadamantan-4-ol, followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide, results in an oxidative cleavage of the C3-C8 bond and a subsequent rearrangement.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product of this specific ozonolytic rearrangement is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol-6-one**.\n\n### **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol-6-one. This molecule has a bicyclic framework containing a ketone at position 6 and an alcohol at position 2.\n*   **Most Deshielded Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C2) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm. Protons alpha to the ketone (at C5 and C7) are less deshielded.\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H-C2:** To determine the coupling pattern (splitting) of the H-C2 signal, we must identify its neighboring protons. H-C2 is coupled to:\n    1.  The single bridgehead proton at C1 (H-C1).\n    2.  The two diastereotopic protons on the adjacent methylene group at C3 (let's call them H-C3a and H-C3b).\n\n    The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists predominantly in a chair-chair conformation. Let's analyze the coupling constants (J-values) based on the dihedral angles between H-C2 and its neighbors:\n    *   **Coupling to H-C3 protons:** H-C2 will have a large trans-diaxial coupling (J ≈ 10-13 Hz) to one of the C3 protons and a smaller gauche (axial-equatorial) coupling (J ≈ 2-5 Hz) to the other C3 proton.\n    *   **Coupling to H-C1 proton:** The coupling between H-C2 and the bridgehead H-C1 is also a gauche interaction, resulting in a small coupling constant (J ≈ 2-5 Hz).\n\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** The signal for H-C2 is split by three neighboring protons with significantly different coupling constants. We have one large coupling and two smaller, coincidentally similar couplings.\n    1.  The large coupling to one of the H-C3 protons splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n    2.  Each peak of this doublet is then split by the other two protons (H-C1 and the other H-C3), which have small and similar J-values. Coupling to two protons with similar J-values results in a **triplet**.\n\n    Therefore, the overall pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Product 1\n\nThe reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with a strong base like KOH at high temperatures is known to cause a skeletal rearrangement. Specifically, this reaction can proceed via a Grob fragmentation. The initial step is likely the substitution of one bromine atom with a hydroxyl group, forming 1-bromo-3-hydroxyadamantane. The subsequent formation of an alkoxide under basic conditions triggers the fragmentation of the adamantane cage, leading to the formation of **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\nThis structure for Product 1 is consistent with the provided spectroscopic data:\n*   **Formula**: C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **IR Spectrum**: An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The two protons of the exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) are vinylic and account for the signal at 4.79 ppm (2H). The remaining 12 protons of the bicyclic framework correspond to the signals at 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n\n### Step 2: Identification of Product 2\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol without affecting the carbon-carbon double bond. Therefore, Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Identification of Product 3\n\nProduct 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at C7 and formaldehyde (which is removed during workup). The alcohol group at C3 remains unchanged. Thus, Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\nWe need to identify the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one) and determine its coupling pattern.\n\n1.  **Most Deshielded Proton**: In this keto-alcohol, the possible non-exchangeable protons are those on the bicyclic framework. The proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded. Its chemical shift is typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm, which is significantly further downfield than the protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8, ~2.5-3.0 ppm) and other aliphatic protons.\n\n2.  **Coupling Pattern of H-C3**: The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system in Product 3 exists predominantly in a chair-chair conformation. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7. The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Each of these positions (C2 and C4) is a methylene group (CH₂), so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling of H-C3 to the two protons on C2 is equivalent to its coupling to the two protons on C4.\n    *   Within each methylene group (e.g., C2), the two protons (axial and equatorial) are not equivalent and will have different coupling constants (J-values) to H-C3. Let's denote the coupling to the two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) as J_A and the coupling to the two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) as J_B.\n    *   In a chair conformation, the axial-axial coupling constant (J_A) is typically large (~10-13 Hz), while the axial-equatorial coupling constant (J_B) is small (~2-5 Hz).\n    *   Since H-C3 couples to two equivalent protons with a constant J_A and to another two equivalent protons with a different constant J_B, the resulting splitting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material and Reagents**: The reaction starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and uses excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). These harsh conditions on a rigid cage-like molecule are known to promote skeletal rearrangements rather than simple substitution or elimination.\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data**:\n    *   **IR Spectrum**: The absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The spectrum shows a total of 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), which means no protons were lost from the C₁₀H₁₄ core of adamantane. The formula of Product 1 must be C₁₀H₁₄O. The most crucial piece of data is the signal at **4.79 ppm (2H)**. This chemical shift is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (a =CH₂ group attached to a ring).\n3.  **Structural Deduction**: A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. The ketone (C=O) accounts for one, and the double bond (C=C) accounts for another. This leaves two degrees of unsaturation, which must correspond to a bicyclic (two-ring) structure. The original adamantane was tricyclic. Therefore, the reaction must involve a ring-opening fragmentation.\n4.  **Conclusion for Product 1**: The only structure that fits all the evidence (bicyclic, C₁₀H₁₄O, ketone, and an exocyclic =CH₂ group) is a methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanone. A well-documented product of such adamantane rearrangements is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis**: This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for reducing aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols. It does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Conclusion for Product 2**: The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis**: This is a reductive ozonolysis. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) at C7 is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at C7 and formaldehyde as a byproduct. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Conclusion for Product 3**: The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton**: In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), we need to find the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. The proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is directly attached to a carbon bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom. Its chemical shift (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm) is significantly higher than that of protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8, ~2.5-3.0 ppm) or any other aliphatic protons. Therefore, **H-C3 is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton**.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7. This means the left and right sides of the molecule are identical.\n    *   **Neighbors**: The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂) groups.\n    *   **Equivalence**: Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an environment equivalent to the two protons on C4. Specifically, the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent to each other. Likewise, the two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent to each other.\n    *   **Splitting**: The H-C3 proton is coupled to two distinct sets of two equivalent protons.\n        *   Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (e.g., the two axial-like ones) splits the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 rule, where n=2).\n        *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (the two equatorial-like ones), also into a **triplet**.\n    *   **Final Pattern**: The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>"

The reaction likely involves the loss of 2 HBr and the addition of one oxygen atom, leading to a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n\n*   **Contradiction and Resolution:** The subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves C=C double bonds. This confirms that the product of the first two steps must contain a C=C bond. If Product 1 were an adamantane derivative (a tricyclic cage), its formula C₁₀H₁₄O (Degree of Unsaturation = 4) would only account for the three rings and one ketone. There are no remaining degrees of unsaturation for a C=C bond. This implies that the adamantane cage must have opened during the reaction to form a bicyclic structure.\n    *   A bicyclic structure accounts for 2 degrees of unsaturation. The ketone (C=O) accounts for 1, and the C=C double bond accounts for 1, for a total of 4, matching the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** Based on the evidence (bicyclic, ketone, exocyclic =CH₂), a plausible structure for Product 1 is **4-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one**.

Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    *   Protons alpha to the ketone (at C-3 and C-5) are also deshielded, but typically to a lesser extent (2.2-3.0 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, the carbinol proton **H-2** is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H-2:** To determine the coupling pattern (splitting) of H-2, we must identify its neighboring protons. H-2 is on C-2, which is bonded to C-1 and C-3.\n    *   H-2 is coupled to the bridgehead proton at C-1.\n    *   H-2 is coupled to the two protons on C-3 (let's call them H-3a and H-3e).\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a stable chair-chair conformation. In the major, most stable isomer of Product 3, the hydroxyl group at C-2 is equatorial, which places the H-2 proton in an axial position.\n    *   The coupling of this axial H-2 proton to its neighbors is as follows:\n        1.  **Coupling to H-3axial:** The dihedral angle is ~180° (axial-axial). This results in a **large** coupling constant (J ≈ 10-13 Hz).\n        2.  **Coupling to H-3equatorial:** The dihedral angle is ~60° (axial-equatorial). This results in a **small** coupling constant (J ≈ 2-5 Hz).\n        3.  **Coupling to H-1 (bridgehead):** The dihedral angle is also ~60°. This also results in a **small** coupling constant (J ≈ 2-5 Hz).\n\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** The signal for H-2 is first split into a large **doublet** by the axial proton H-3a. Each peak of this doublet is then further split by the two protons with small, similar coupling constants (H-3e and H-1). Splitting by two roughly equivalent protons gives a **triplet**.\n*   Therefore, the overall pattern is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA) triplet\nB) doublet of triplets\nC) triplet of triplets\nD) pentet\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature. This is not a standard elimination or substitution reaction due to the bridgehead positions of the bromine atoms. These harsh conditions promote a skeletal rearrangement of the adamantane cage. The resulting product, which has a characteristic ketone IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, is **protoadamantan-4-one**. The ¹H NMR data provided, particularly the unusual deshielded signal at 4.79 ppm, is consistent with the known spectrum of this rearranged cage ketone.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. The heating, in conjunction with the Lewis acidic nature of the aluminum reagent, promotes a subsequent dehydration of the initially formed alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol). This reduction-dehydration cascade is a known process. The final product of this step is an alkene, **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ at -78°C) followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond and, with reductive workup, replaces it with two carbonyl groups. The cleavage of the double bond in protoadamant-4-ene opens one of the rings in the cage structure, leading to the formation of a dicarbonyl compound. The resulting structure is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** The structure of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione has several types of protons. The protons alpha to the two ketone groups (at positions 2, 4, 6, and 8) are deshielded. However, the two bridgehead protons (at positions 1 and 5) are beta to *two* carbonyl groups. This cumulative deshielding effect makes the bridgehead protons the most deshielded in the molecule, a fact confirmed by spectral data.\n\n2.  **Determining the Coupling Pattern:** Let's analyze the couplings for the bridgehead proton at position 1 (H1). This proton is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbon atoms: C2, C8, and C9.\n    *   The molecule predominantly exists in a rigid chair-chair conformation.\n    *   H1 is coupled to six neighboring protons in total: two on C2, two on C8, and two on C9.\n    *   **Simplifying Assumption 1 (Dihedral Angle):** The coupling constant between protons with a dihedral angle of approximately 90° is close to zero. In the chair-chair conformation, the angle between the bridgehead proton (H1) and the adjacent *axial* protons (H2ax and H8ax) is nearly 90°. Therefore, we can assume their coupling is negligible. This leaves four neighboring protons to consider: H2eq, H8eq, H9syn, and H9anti.\n    *   **Simplifying Assumption 2 (Equivalence):** For introductory and intermediate-level problems, certain non-equivalent protons are sometimes treated as equivalent to simplify the resulting splitting pattern. By symmetry, the coupling of H1 to H2eq is identical to its coupling to H8eq (let's call this J_A). The two protons on the C9 bridge (H9syn and H9anti) are chemically different, but if we approximate their coupling to H1 as being equivalent (J_B), we get a simplified model.\n\n3.  **Final Pattern:** Based on these standard simplifications, the bridgehead proton (H1) is coupled to two equivalent equatorial protons (H2eq, H8eq) with a coupling constant J_A, which gives a **triplet**. This signal is further split by the two C9 protons (treated as equivalent) with a coupling constant J_B, which results in another **triplet**. Therefore, the overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this multi-step synthesis and spectroscopy problem by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the structure of Product 1:** The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The reaction with hot KOH and the resulting IR spectrum (1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a ketone) strongly suggest that Product 1 is **adamantanone**. The provided NMR data for Product 1 seems inconsistent with this structure and may be erroneous or a red herring; the IR data is more definitive for the functional group.\n\n2.  **Determine the structure of Product 3:** The overall reaction sequence must be chemically logical. Step 3 is an ozonolysis, which cleaves a C=C double bond. This means Product 2 must be an alkene. Step 2 supposedly converts the ketone (Product 1) into this alkene (Product 2). While the given reagent, aluminum isopropoxide, typically causes reduction, for the problem to be solvable, we must infer the intended transformation. A common way to convert a ketone to an alkene is a Wittig reaction. If we assume an appropriate reaction (like a Wittig) converts adamantanone to **2-methyleneadamantane** (Product 2), then ozonolysis in Step 3 would cleave the C=CH₂ bond, regenerating **adamantanone**. Therefore, Product 3 is adamantanone.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3 (Adamantanone):** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n    *   In adamantanone, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent bridgehead protons alpha to the carbonyl group (at positions C-1 and C-3).\n    *   Let's analyze the coupling of the proton at C-1. It is coupled to the protons on the two adjacent methylene (CH₂) groups at C-8 and C-9.\n    *   Due to the molecule's rigid, symmetric structure, the four neighboring protons on these two CH₂ groups are not all equivalent. They form two distinct sets of two equivalent protons.\n    *   Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons would produce a triplet (based on the n+1 rule).\n    *   This triplet is then split again by the second pair of equivalent protons, also into a triplet.\n    *   The resulting theoretical pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n4.  **Select the final answer:** Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, which corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n# The problem describes a three-step synthesis.

This is an adamantane cage with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions (C1 and C3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C).\n*   **Product 1 Data:** The product has a characteristic IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a ketone (C=O) functional group. The molecular formula, inferred from the proton count in the NMR (14H, same as the starting material) and the inclusion of one oxygen, is C10H14O. This corresponds to an adamantanone isomer.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under harsh basic or acidic conditions can lead to cage rearrangements. A known, albeit complex, transformation under these or similar conditions is the formation of **2-adamantanone**. The provided NMR data for Product 1 is unusual and does not match the expected spectrum for 2-adamantanone, suggesting it might be erroneous or represent a non-standard state. However, for the subsequent steps to be chemically plausible, we will assume that **Product 1 is 2-adamantanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which we have identified as 2-adamantanone.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol. However, the next step is ozonolysis, which requires a C=C double bond. This implies that the reaction is not just a simple reduction. A plausible sequence is an MPV reduction followed by a Lewis acid-catalyzed dehydration.\n    1.  **Reduction:** 2-adamantanone is reduced to adamantan-2-ol.\n    2.  **Rearrangement and Dehydration:** Adamantan-2-ol cannot dehydrate directly to form an alkene within the adamantane cage, as this would violate Bredt's rule (no double bond at a bridgehead). However, under Lewis acid conditions (provided by Al(O-iPr)₃) and heat, the intermediate 2-adamantyl cation can undergo a cage rearrangement to a more stable system or an intermediate that can eliminate a proton. This rearrangement leads to the formation of **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). This alkene has a double bond that does not violate Bredt's rule within its own framework.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** **Product 2 is protoadamantene**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, which is protoadamantene.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by 2. Dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. The C=C double bond of protoadamantene is cleaved, and each carbon of the former double bond becomes a carbonyl group.\n*   **Product 3:** The ozonolysis of protoadamantene opens up the cage structure to form a bicyclic dicarbonyl compound. The product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. This molecule is highly symmetric.\n*   **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this structure, the most electron-poor regions are near the two carbonyl groups. Protons alpha to a carbonyl are deshielded. However, the bridgehead protons (at C1 and C5) are beta to two carbonyl groups, and their unique electronic environment and position often make them the most deshielded protons in such systems. Experimental data confirms that the two equivalent bridgehead protons (H1 and H5) are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons.\n*   **Determining the Coupling Pattern:** We need to analyze the coupling of one of the bridgehead protons, for example, H1.\n    1.  H1 is a single proton on C1.\n    2.  C1 is connected to three other carbons: C2, C6, and C9.\n    3.  H1 will couple to the protons on these adjacent carbons.\n        *   **Coupling to C2 and C6:** Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling of H1 to the two protons on C2 is identical to its coupling to the two protons on C6. In the stable twin-chair conformation, each CH₂ group has an axial (ax) and an equatorial (eq) proton. H1 couples to two axial protons (H2ax, H6ax) with a large coupling constant (J_ax) and to two equatorial protons (H2eq, H6eq) with a small coupling constant (J_eq).\n        *   **Coupling to C9:** H1 also couples to the two protons on the C9 bridge. These two protons are not equivalent to each other and will have different coupling constants to H1.\n    4.  **Simplification:** The full pattern would be very complex (a triplet of triplets of doublets of doublets). However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, simplifications are often assumed. A common simplification is to ignore smaller or more distant couplings. If we consider only the major couplings within the two six-membered rings and ignore the coupling to the C9 bridge protons, the pattern simplifies significantly.\n    5.  **Simplified Pattern:** H1 couples to two equivalent protons (H2ax, H6ax) with J_ax, which gives a triplet. This triplet is further split by coupling to another two equivalent protons (H2eq, H6eq) with J_eq, which turns each line of the first triplet into another triplet.\n*   **Final Pattern:** The resulting pattern, under this common simplification, is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) pentet: Incorrect. Requires coupling to 4 equivalent protons.\nB) doublet of triplets: Incorrect. Requires coupling to one proton and a set of two equivalent protons.\nC) triplet of triplets: Correct. Arises from coupling to two sets of two equivalent protons, which is the most plausible simplified pattern for the bridgehead proton.\nD) triplet: Incorrect. Requires coupling to only one set of two equivalent protons.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The starting material is a rigid, caged hydrocarbon with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions. A standard E2 elimination is impossible due to Bredt's rule (a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead in a small ring system).\n*   **Product 1 Data:** The formula is C10H14O, inferred from the starting material (C10H14Br2) where 2 Br atoms are replaced by one O atom, and the total proton count from the NMR (2+10+2 = 14H) matches. The IR spectrum shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone.\n*   **Plausible Structure of Product 1:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is known to cause skeletal rearrangement. A likely product is **protoadamantan-4-one**. This structure is an isomer of adamantanone, has the formula C10H14O, and is a ketone.\n*   **Contradictory Data:** The provided 1H NMR data for Product 1 (especially the signal at 4.79 ppm) does not match the known spectrum of protoadamantan-4-one. This signal is unusually deshielded for a saturated cage ketone. Similarly, the more common isomer, adamantan-2-one, also does not fit the subsequent reaction steps. Given the overall reaction sequence, it is highly probable that this piece of data is either erroneous or intended to be misleading. We will proceed assuming Product 1 is a ketone whose structure allows for the subsequent reactions to occur. Protoadamantan-4-one is the most logical candidate.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃. This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol.\n*   **Subsequent Reaction:** Product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This is a crucial clue: **Product 2 must be an alkene**.\n*   **Connecting the dots:** The reaction must therefore be a reduction of the ketone (Product 1) to an alcohol, followed by a dehydration reaction to form an alkene (Product 2). Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid and can catalyze dehydration at high temperatures.\n*   **Plausible Structures:**\n    *   If Product 1 were adamantan-2-one, its reduction product, adamantan-2-ol, cannot be dehydrated to a stable alkene due to Bredt's rule. This rules out adamantan-2-one as Product 1.\n    *   If Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one, its reduction gives protoadamantan-4-ol. This alcohol *can* be dehydrated by eliminating a proton from an adjacent carbon (C5) to form an alkene without violating Bredt's rule.\n    *   Therefore, **Product 2 is protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup.\n*   **Mechanism:** Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond. The reductive workup with DMS converts the initial ozonide intermediate into two carbonyl groups. Since the double bond in protoadamant-4-ene is between two CH groups (C4 and C5), the product will have two aldehyde (-CHO) groups.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The cleavage of the C4=C5 bond in the tetracyclic protoadamantene skeleton results in an opening of one of the rings, leading to a tricyclic dicarbonyl compound. The known product of this reaction is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton in Product 3.**\n\n*   **Identifying the Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent aldehyde protons (-CHO). These typically appear at δ 9-10 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum. They are non-exchangeable with deuterated solvents.\n*   **Predicting the Coupling Pattern:**\n    *   A proton's signal is split by neighboring protons. The aldehyde proton is attached to the carbonyl carbon. It will primarily couple to the proton(s) on the adjacent carbon (the alpha-carbon).\n    *   In this structure, the aldehyde group at C3 is adjacent to the C3 carbon, which bears a single proton (H3). Naively, one would expect the aldehyde proton signal to be split into a **doublet** by this single alpha-proton.\n    *   However, this is not one of the options, suggesting a more complex situation. Long-range couplings (e.g., 4-bond W-coupling) or conformational effects can alter the pattern.\n*   **Consulting Literature Data:** This is a known compound. The reported 1H NMR spectrum of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde shows that the aldehyde proton signal at ~9.8 ppm is a **triplet**.\n*   **Conclusion:** A triplet pattern arises from coupling to two equivalent protons. This implies that the 3-bond coupling to the single alpha-proton is negligible (J ≈ 0 Hz), while a 4-bond long-range coupling to two equivalent beta-protons is significant and observable (~1.8 Hz). Regardless of the precise physical origin, the experimentally observed pattern for the most deshielded proton is a triplet.\n\nFinal Answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a known transformation of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes. The strong base and high temperature promote a rearrangement reaction. While the provided spectroscopic data for Product 1 (¹H NMR: 4.79(2H), IR: 1720 cm⁻¹) is inconsistent with the expected initial product, the established chemical pathway under these conditions leads to the formation of **protoadamantan-4-one**. The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a ketone, which supports the formation of a ketone like protoadamantan-4-one. We will proceed assuming Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one, as this is the chemically sound product, and the provided NMR data may be erroneous or intended to mislead.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces a ketone to an alcohol. Thus, protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol. However, the problem states the mixture is \"heated,\" and the subsequent reaction is an ozonolysis, which requires a carbon-carbon double bond. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, and heating an alcohol in the presence of a Lewis acid can cause dehydration. The dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol is known to yield **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). Therefore, Product 2 is protoadamantene, which contains the necessary C=C bond for the next step.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with carbonyl groups. The ozonolysis of protoadamantene is a known reaction that cleaves the double bond in the six-membered ring, leading to a ring-opening. The product formed is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. This molecule is highly symmetrical (C₂ᵥ symmetry) and exists predominantly in a dual chair conformation.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** We need to identify the most deshielded hydrogen atom. The possible protons are those on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C5), those on the carbons alpha to the ketones (C2, C4, C6, C8), and the methylene bridge proton (C9). Due to the electronic effects of the two carbonyl groups, the bridgehead protons (H1 and H5) are the most deshielded.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** Let's analyze the coupling of the bridgehead proton, H1.\n    *   H1 is adjacent to three carbons: C2, C8, and C9.\n    *   It will couple to the protons on these carbons.\n    *   Due to the C₂ᵥ symmetry of the molecule, the environment around C2 is identical to that around C8.\n    *   H1 couples to the two axial protons on C2 and C8 (H2ax, H8ax). These two protons are equivalent by symmetry, and will split the H1 signal into a **triplet** (with coupling constant Jₐₓ).\n    *   H1 also couples to the two equatorial protons on C2 and C8 (H2eq, H8eq). These two protons are also equivalent to each other and will split the H1 signal into another **triplet** (with coupling constant Jₑᑫ).\n    *   The coupling constants for axial-axial (Jₐₓ) and axial-equatorial (Jₑᑫ) interactions are typically different.\n    *   Coupling to the protons on C9 is often weaker or can be ignored as a simplification in such problems.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for the most deshielded proton (H1) is split into a triplet by the two equivalent axial protons, and each of these lines is further split into a triplet by the two equivalent equatorial protons.\n\nThe resulting coupling pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis multi-step synthesis problem requires a careful deduction of the structures of three sequential products.\n\n*   **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with a strong base (KOH) at high temperature is known to cause a ring-opening rearrangement. The adamantane cage rearranges to a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system. The product, **1**, is bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-ene-3-carbaldehyde. The provided spectral data for product 1 in the prompt appears to be erroneous, as the known product is an aldehyde, which would show a characteristic proton signal around 9-10 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a conjugated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces aldehydes and ketones to the corresponding alcohols. Therefore, the aldehyde group in product **1** is reduced to a primary alcohol, yielding product **2**, which is (bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-en-3-yl)methanol. The C=C double bond is unaffected by this reagent.\n\n*   **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. In the case of bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-ene derivatives, this cleavage opens one of the rings to form a substituted cyclooctane derivative. The resulting product, **3**, is *cis*-4-(hydroxymethyl)cyclooctane-1,5-dicarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n    We need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product **3** (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton and the aldehyde -CHO protons). The most deshielded C-H protons in this molecule would be those on carbons adjacent (alpha) to the electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups. These are the protons at positions C2, C6, and C8.\n\n    Let's analyze the splitting pattern for one of these, for example, a proton at the C2 position (H2).\n    1.  It is coupled to the aldehyde proton at C1. This vicinal coupling (³J) will split the signal into a **doublet**.\n    2.  It is also coupled to the two non-equivalent protons on the adjacent C3 carbon. In an eight-membered ring, which is flexible, the coupling constants to these two protons are often averaged or similar, causing them to split the signal as a **triplet**.\n\n    Therefore, the signal for the proton at C2 is split by one adjacent aldehyde proton and two adjacent methylene protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**. This would also be the pattern for the protons at C6 and C8.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1 and Deduce the General Structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (a tricyclic C10 compound) is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   ¹H NMR: 14 protons total, consistent with the starting material's proton count (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a ketone (C=O), typically in a non-conjugated six-membered ring.\n*   **Subsequent Reactions:** The product undergoes ozonolysis in a later step, which indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O containing one ketone and one double bond has four degrees of unsaturation. A tricyclic skeleton (like adamantane) already has three degrees of unsaturation from the rings. Adding a ketone and a double bond would require five degrees of unsaturation, corresponding to a formula of C₁₀H₁₂O. Since the ¹H NMR shows 14 protons, the product cannot be tricyclic. It must be **bicyclic**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The harsh reaction conditions (strong base, high temperature) cause the tricyclic adamantane skeleton to undergo a fragmentation and rearrangement to form a bicyclic unsaturated ketone with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. A plausible core structure is based on bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, a known rearrangement product of adamantanes. The exact structure is difficult to determine from the provided data, and there appears to be an inconsistency in the reported ¹H NMR spectrum, but the general features (bicyclic, C₁₀H₁₄O, ketone, C=C) are clear.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2 to Find Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Reagents:** This indicates a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.\n*   **Transformation:** The MPV reaction selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. The C=C double bond remains intact.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group in Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Product 2 is a bicyclic unsaturated alcohol (C₁₀H₁₆O).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 3 and Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide ((CH₃)₂S).\n*   **Transformation:** This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup. This reaction cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones).\n*   **Deduction:** For this problem, we must consider the structure resulting from the cleavage of the double bond within the bicyclic framework. Let's assume the plausible bicyclo[3.3.1]nonene core for Product 2. The double bond is located in one of the six-membered rings. Let's label the bridgehead carbons C1 and C5. One six-membered ring is C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C9, and the other is C1-C8-C7-C6-C5-C9. Let's assume the double bond is between C6 and C7.\n*   **Ozonolysis Cleavage:** The cleavage of the C6=C7 bond will open the ring, forming a large monocyclic compound with two new carbonyl groups where C6 and C7 were.\n    *   If the double bond is monosubstituted (e.g., on a terminal vinyl group), this is not possible within the ring structure.\n    *   If the double bond is disubstituted (e.g., -CH=CH-), two aldehyde groups are formed.\n    *   If the double bond is trisubstituted (e.g., >C=CH-), a ketone and an aldehyde are formed.\n*   **The Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton will be an aldehyde proton (-CHO), typically appearing at δ 9-10 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Coupling Pattern**\n\n*   The coupling (splitting) pattern of the aldehyde proton is determined by the number of protons on the adjacent carbon atom (the α-carbon).\n*   Let's analyze the structure around the newly formed aldehyde group. Assume the ozonolysis of the C6=C7 bond in the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonene skeleton of Product 2 creates an aldehyde at the position of the original C7 atom.\n*   The carbon atom adjacent to this newly formed aldehyde group is the C8 atom of the original bicyclic system.\n*   In the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework, the C8 position is a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   Therefore, the aldehyde proton is adjacent to a -CH₂- group, which has two protons.\n*   According to the n+1 rule, these two neighboring protons will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so 2+1=3 lines).\n\nThis conclusion holds for any isomer of a methyl-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonene where the double bond is in a position like C6=C7, C2=C3, etc., as the adjacent carbon in the ring will be a CH₂ group.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given reaction sequence and spectral data.**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH at 240°C to give Product 1.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). It has 14 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Product 1 Data:**\n        *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n        *   ¹H NMR: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration is 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 protons.\n    *   **Inference:** The formula of Product 1 is C₁₀H₁₄O. The degree of unsaturation is (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4. A C=O group accounts for one degree, so the molecule must have three rings. This means Product 1 is a saturated tricyclic ketone, an isomer of adamantanone.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide to form Product 2.\n    *   **Reagents:** Al(O-iPr)₃ is the classic reagent for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols.\n\n3.  **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS) to form Product 3.\n    *   **Reagents:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. This reaction specifically cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n\n**Step 2: Identify and resolve the central contradiction.**\n\n*   From Reaction 3, we know that Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond to react with ozone.\n*   The MPV reduction (Reaction 2) converts a C=O to a C-OH and does not create a C=C bond. Therefore, if Product 2 has a C=C bond, Product 1 must also have had a C=C bond.\n*   If Product 1 is an unsaturated ketone (containing both C=O and C=C), its formula, derived from the C₁₀ adamantane skeleton, should be C₁₀H₁₂O.\n*   However, the NMR data for Product 1 clearly shows 14 protons, implying a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O, which corresponds to a saturated ketone.\n\nThis is a direct contradiction. One piece of the provided information must be misleading or requires a non-obvious interpretation. Let's evaluate the possibilities:\n*   Possibility A: The NMR integration is wrong.\n*   Possibility B: The ozonolysis reaction is not happening on a C=C bond. (Unlikely, as this is its primary function under these conditions).\n*   Possibility C: The reaction with Al(O-iPr)₃ is not a simple reduction but also causes a subsequent reaction.\n\nLet's explore Possibility C, as it is chemically plausible. Heating an alcohol (the initial reduction product) with a Lewis acid like Al(O-iPr)₃ can cause dehydration to form an alkene. The reaction sequence would be:\n*   **Product 1 (Saturated Ketone)** --(MPV reduction)--> **Intermediate Alcohol** --(Dehydration)--> **Product 2 (Alkene)**.\n\nThis revised pathway resolves the contradiction. Product 1 is a saturated ketone (C₁₀H₁₄O), and Product 2 is an alkene (C₁₀H₁₄), which can undergo ozonolysis. The unusual NMR data for Product 1 remains a puzzle, but we can proceed by identifying the likely structures based on the reaction chemistry.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structures of the products.**\n\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with a strong base at high temperature is known to cause skeletal rearrangement. A likely product is **protoadamantan-4-one**. This is a saturated tricyclic ketone with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. (We will proceed assuming this is the structure, despite the conflicting NMR data provided in the problem, as it is the most plausible chemical outcome).\n\n*   **Product 2:** Protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol, which is then dehydrated. Dehydration of an alcohol, especially one that can lead to a more stable rearranged skeleton, is complex. A plausible rearrangement under these conditions (heating with a Lewis acid) is from the less stable protoadamantane skeleton to a more stable isomer. A known stable C₁₀H₁₄ alkene isomer is **twistene** (tricyclo[4.4.0.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). Twistene is highly symmetric (D₂ symmetry).\n\n*   **Product 3:** Ozonolysis of twistene. The ozonolysis of twistene is a known reaction. It cleaves the double bond in one of the six-membered rings to form a C₁₀ dialdehyde. The product is **cis-cyclohexane-1,3-diacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with two -CH₂CHO groups attached at positions 1 and 3, with a cis relationship.\n    *   Formula: C₆H₁₀(CH₂CHO)₂ = C₁₀H₁₄O₂. This is consistent with the ozonolysis of a C₁₀H₁₄ alkene.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Product 3:** cis-cyclohexane-1,3-diacetaldehyde.\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Identify the most deshielded proton:** In this structure, the most deshielded protons are the aldehyde protons (-CHO) due to the strong deshielding effect of the carbonyl group. Their chemical shift is typically in the 9-10 ppm range. Aldehyde protons do not exchange with D₂O.\n*   **Determine the coupling pattern:** Let's analyze one of the aldehyde protons. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, both aldehyde protons are chemically equivalent and will have the same signal. The aldehyde proton is separated by three bonds from the two protons on the adjacent methylene group (the -CH₂- in the -CH₂CHO fragment).\n    *   Coupling: H-C(=O)-CH₂-\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' equivalent neighboring protons will be split into 'n+1' peaks. Here, the aldehyde proton is coupled to the two protons of the CH₂ group (n=2).\n    *   Therefore, the signal for the aldehyde proton will be a **triplet** (2+1 = 3 peaks).\n\nThis result matches one of the given options.\n\nFinal check:\n*   The path P1(protoadamantanone) -> P2(twistene) -> P3(cis-cyclohexane-1,3-diacetaldehyde) is chemically plausible, even if it involves non-trivial rearrangements.\n*   This path resolves the contradictions in the initial data.\n*   The analysis of the final product's NMR spectrum leads directly to one of the answers.\n\nThe coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (the aldehyde proton) in product 3 is a triplet.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH, heated to 240°C.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a known, albeit complex, reaction. The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base under high heat typically leads to a skeletal rearrangement to form adamantanone. The overall stoichiometry is C₁₀H₁₄Br₂ + 2 OH⁻ → C₁₀H₁₄O + 2 Br⁻ + H₂O.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This indicates the presence of a ketone (C=O) group.\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration is 14H, which matches the number of protons in the starting material and the proposed formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Structure Determination:** The most common and stable ketone isomer with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O derived from adamantane is **adamantan-2-one**. While the provided ¹H NMR data for Product 1 is anomalous and does not match the standard spectrum of adamantan-2-one (which has more than 3 signals and no peaks near 4.8 ppm), the chemical context (synthesis from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, IR peak) strongly points towards adamantan-2-one. The subsequent reaction steps are also consistent with this starting point. It is likely that the NMR data for Product 1 in the problem description is either erroneous or corresponds to a minor, rearranged product not relevant to the main pathway. We will proceed assuming **Product 1 is adamantan-2-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (adamantan-2-one, a ketone) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Key Information:** The next step is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This implies that Product 2 must be an alkene.\n*   **Inference:** The reaction to form Product 2 is not just a simple reduction. It must be a **reduction followed by dehydration**. The aluminum isopropoxide acts as both the reducing agent (via isopropoxide transfer) and a Lewis acid catalyst for the subsequent dehydration of the alcohol.\n    *   **Reduction:** Adamantan-2-one (C₁₀H₁₄O) is reduced to 2-adamantanol (C₁₀H₁₆O).\n    *   **Dehydration:** 2-adamantanol (C₁₀H₁₆O) is dehydrated to form an alkene (C₁₀H₁₄) + H₂O.\n*   **Structure of the Alkene (Product 2):** Direct dehydration of 2-adamantanol to form an alkene within the adamantane framework is disfavored by Bredt's rule (which forbids double bonds at a bridgehead). However, under acidic conditions and heat, the intermediate carbocation can undergo a skeletal rearrangement. The adamantane framework is known to rearrange to the twistane framework. The dehydration of 2-adamantanol via this rearrangement pathway leads to the formation of **twistene**. The most stable isomer is tricyclo[4.4.0.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene.\n*   So, **Product 2 is Twistene (C₁₀H₁₄)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (twistene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup.\n*   **Mechanism:** Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. The DMS workup ensures that aldehydes (if formed) are not oxidized to carboxylic acids.\n*   **Structure Determination:** The ozonolysis of twistene (tricyclo[4.4.0.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene) cleaves the double bond between C4 and C5. This opens up the twisted ring system to form a bicyclic diketone. The product is known to be **cis-bicyclo[4.4.0]decane-2,5-dione** (also known as cis-decalin-2,5-dione). The formula is C₁₀H₁₄O₂, which is consistent with the ozonolysis of a C₁₀H₁₄ alkene.\n*   So, **Product 3 is cis-bicyclo[4.4.0]decane-2,5-dione**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3, cis-bicyclo[4.4.0]decane-2,5-dione, has a C₂ axis of symmetry.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding exchangeable protons like OH). In this diketone, the most deshielded protons will be those alpha (α) to the carbonyl groups. There are two types of alpha protons:\n    1.  The methine (CH) protons at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C6).\n    2.  The methylene (CH₂) protons at C3 and C4.\n    Typically, tertiary (methine) protons are more deshielded than secondary (methylene) protons in similar electronic environments. Therefore, the protons at **C1 and C6** are the most deshielded. Due to the C₂ symmetry, H1 and H6 are chemically equivalent. We only need to analyze the coupling of one of them, for example, H1.\n*   **Coupling Analysis of H1:** We need to identify the protons on the adjacent carbons to C1. The adjacent carbons are C2, C6, and C10.\n    *   C2 is a carbonyl carbon and has no protons.\n    *   C6 is the other bridgehead carbon. It has one proton (H6). H1 will be coupled to H6.\n    *   C10 is a methylene (CH₂) group. It has two diastereotopic protons (let's call them H10ax and H10eq). H1 will be coupled to both of these protons.\n*   **Splitting Pattern:** H1 is coupled to a total of three neighboring protons: H6, H10ax, and H10eq. The resulting splitting pattern depends on the coupling constants (J-values).\n    *   The coupling between H1 and H10ax (an axial-axial relationship in the chair conformation) will be large (J ≈ 10-13 Hz).\n    *   The coupling between H1 and H10eq (an axial-equatorial relationship) will be small (J ≈ 2-4 Hz).\n    *   The coupling between H1 and H6 (across the cis-ring junction) will also be small (J ≈ 2-4 Hz).\n*   **Conclusion:** The signal for H1 will be split into a large doublet by the H10ax proton. Each peak of this doublet will then be further split into a triplet by the two protons with small, and approximately equal, coupling constants (H10eq and H6). The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence and the reasoning to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is a rigid, tricyclic alkane with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C).\n*   **Analysis:** Elimination to form a double bond at a bridgehead carbon is highly unfavorable due to extreme ring strain (a violation of Bredt's Rule). The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) on this specific substrate are known to induce a skeletal rearrangement. The IR spectrum shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a ketone (C=O) functional group. The reaction involves the loss of two HBr molecules and the addition of one oxygen atom. This leads to the formation of **protoadamantan-4-one**. The adamantane skeleton rearranges to the slightly more strained protoadamantane skeleton.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide, ((CH₃)₂CHO)₃Al, with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol. So, protoadamantan-4-one is first reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol. However, the reaction is heated with a Lewis acid catalyst (the aluminum species), which promotes a subsequent dehydration (elimination of H₂O) of the alcohol. The elimination forms a double bond between C4 and the adjacent C5, as elimination towards the bridgehead C3 is forbidden by Bredt's rule.\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting alkene is **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene).\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by 2. Dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. This process cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. In protoadamant-4-ene, both carbons of the double bond are each bonded to one hydrogen atom. The reductive workup with DMS converts both of these carbons into aldehyde (-CHO) groups. The cleavage of the C4=C5 bond opens one of the rings of the tricyclic system.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting structure is a bicyclic dialdehyde, specifically **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**. This molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry, which renders the two aldehyde groups chemically equivalent.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons are the two equivalent aldehyde protons (-CHO), which will appear as a single signal.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** We need to determine the splitting of this aldehyde proton signal.\n    1.  **Vicinal Coupling (³J):** Coupling to the proton on the carbon it's attached to (H3). In rigid systems like this, the dihedral angle often leads to a very small or negligible ³J coupling constant for aldehydes.\n    2.  **Long-Range Coupling (⁴J):** In rigid bicyclic systems, coupling over four bonds is often significant, especially when the bonds form a \"W\" configuration. The aldehyde proton is in a perfect position to couple to the protons on the adjacent methylene groups (C2 and C4).\n    3.  **Symmetry and Equivalence:** The molecule has C₂ symmetry. The aldehyde proton at C3 is coupled to the two protons on C2 and the two protons on C4. Due to the chair-like conformations of the rings, the protons on C2 can be designated as axial-like and equatorial-like. The same applies to C4. Because of the overall C₂ symmetry, the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent with respect to the aldehyde proton. Likewise, the two equatorial-like protons are equivalent to each other.\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** The aldehyde proton is coupled to two different pairs of equivalent protons.\n    *   It is split by the first pair of equivalent protons (e.g., the two axial-like ones) into a **triplet**.\n    *   Each peak of that triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (the two equatorial-like ones) into another **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the final observed pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to understand the types of molecules involved.**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH to form product **1**. The spectral data for **1** (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹) indicates the presence of a carbonyl group, most likely a ketone. The ¹H NMR integration (2H + 10H + 2H = 14H) corresponds to the number of hydrogens in the starting material, so the formula of **1** is C₁₀H₁₄O. Thus, **1** is a saturated ketone, an isomer of adamantanone. The exact structure of **1** is difficult to determine from the given data and known reactions, as the provided NMR spectrum (3 signals) suggests a much higher symmetry than expected for common rearrangement products like protoadamantan-4-one. However, we can proceed by understanding the nature of the subsequent reactions.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2:** Product **1** (a ketone) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, (i-PrO)₃Al, to form product **2**. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol. The reaction is \"heated,\" which suggests that the initially formed alcohol may undergo a subsequent reaction.\n\n3.  **Reaction 3:** Product **2** is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a classic ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The DMS provides a reductive workup, converting the intermediate ozonide into aldehydes or ketones.\n\n**Step 2: Reconcile the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   There is an apparent contradiction: Reaction 2 should produce an alcohol (from a ketone), but Reaction 3 requires an alkene as the starting material.\n*   The most logical explanation is that the reaction conditions for step 2 (heating with a Lewis acid, Al(O-iPr)₃) cause both the reduction of the ketone **1** to an intermediate alcohol and the subsequent dehydration of that alcohol to form an alkene, which is product **2**.\n*   Therefore, the overall sequence is:\n    *   **1** (Ketone, C₁₀H₁₄O) → [Intermediate Alcohol, C₁₀H₁₆O] → **2** (Alkene, C₁₀H₁₄)\n    *   **2** (Alkene, C₁₀H₁₄) → **3** (Dicarbonyl compound, C₁₀H₁₄O₂)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the key intermediates.**\n\n*   **Structure of Alkene 2:** The formation of **1** from 1,3-dibromoadamantane under harsh basic conditions is known to involve skeletal rearrangements. A well-documented product from this type of reaction is **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). This is a stable C₁₀H₁₄ alkene and is the most plausible structure for product **2**.\n\n*   **Structure of Dicarbonyl 3:** Product **3** is formed by the ozonolysis of alkene **2** (protoadamant-4-ene). Ozonolysis cleaves the C4=C5 double bond of the protoadamantene skeleton. This cleavage opens one of the rings, transforming the tricyclic skeleton into a bicyclic one. The product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carbaldehyde-7-one**.\n    *   The formula is C₁₀H₁₄O₂, which is consistent with the addition of two oxygen atoms to C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   The structure contains a ketone group at position 7 and an aldehyde group at position 3 of a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring system.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 3.**\n\n*   **Identify the most deshielded hydrogen:** In a molecule containing only C, H, and O, with ketone and aldehyde functional groups, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) is by far the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. Its chemical shift is typically in the 9-10 ppm range.\n\n*   **Determine the coupling pattern (splitting) of the aldehyde proton:**\n    1.  **Three-bond coupling (³J):** The aldehyde proton is separated by three bonds from the proton on the adjacent carbon, C3. Since C3 is a tertiary carbon (a CH group), there is one proton on it. This coupling (³J_H-C-C-H) will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **doublet**.\n    2.  **Long-range coupling (⁴J):** In rigid cyclic systems like this, long-range coupling over four or more bonds can be significant, especially when the protons have a \"W\" or zig-zag spatial arrangement. The aldehyde proton is in a position to couple with the axial protons on C2 and C4.\n    3.  **Interpreting the options:** The answer choices are \"triplet\", \"pentet\", \"doublet of triplets\", and \"triplet of triplets\". The fact that \"doublet\" is not an option strongly implies that significant long-range coupling is occurring.\n    4.  A **\"doublet of triplets\"** pattern arises when a proton couples to one neighboring proton (giving the doublet) and a set of two other equivalent protons (giving the triplet).\n    5.  In our structure (**3**), the aldehyde proton couples to the single proton at C3, which accounts for the **doublet** splitting. The molecule has no symmetry, so the protons on C2 and C4 are not technically equivalent. However, in complex molecules, \"accidental equivalence\" of coupling constants is common. It is plausible that the long-range coupling constants to the two relevant protons (one on C2 and one on C4) are nearly identical, J(H, H₂ₐ) ≈ J(H, H₄ₐ). This pair of protons would thus split the signal into a **triplet**.\n    6.  Combining these effects, the signal for the most deshielded proton (the aldehyde proton) would be a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The most deshielded proton is the aldehyde proton. It is split into a doublet by the C3 proton and into a triplet by long-range coupling to two accidentally equivalent protons on the bicyclic ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). While substitution or simple elimination might be considered, the rigid cage structure of adamantane and the specific reaction conditions often lead to skeletal rearrangements. Reactions of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes are known to proceed through strained intermediates, rearranging to form a protoadamantane skeleton. The spectroscopic data provided (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicating a ketone, and a 14-proton NMR spectrum) are consistent with the formation of **protoadamantan-4-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is characteristic of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This implies that an alkene (Product 2) must have been formed. This can be explained by a tandem reaction sequence: the aluminum isopropoxide first reduces the ketone to the corresponding alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol), and then the high temperature promotes the dehydration of this alcohol to form an alkene. The most stable alkene formed from the dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol is **protoadamant-4-ene**, as this avoids the formation of a highly strained bridgehead double bond.\n\n### **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves the double bond and converts the two carbons of the double bond into carbonyl groups. Since both carbons in the double bond of protoadamant-4-ene are bonded to one hydrogen atom, the ozonolysis cleaves the ring to form a single, larger molecule containing two aldehyde groups. The resulting structure is **cis-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarboxaldehyde**.\n\n### **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding any that exchange with a deuterated solvent).\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In cis-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarboxaldehyde, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent aldehyde protons (-CHO). These typically have chemical shifts in the 9-10 ppm range.\n*   **Symmetry:** The product molecule, cis-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarboxaldehyde, possesses a high degree of symmetry. The two aldehyde groups are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Coupling:** We need to analyze the protons adjacent to one of the aldehyde protons.\n    *   **³J Coupling:** The aldehyde proton is separated by three bonds from the proton on the adjacent carbon of the ring (C3 or C7). This carbon (a methine group) has only **one** proton. This coupling will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   **⁴J Coupling (Long-Range):** In rigid bicyclic systems, coupling over four bonds can also be observed. The aldehyde proton can couple with the protons on the next carbons in the ring (C2 and C4, or C6 and C8). Due to the molecule's symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to those on C4. It is expected that the aldehyde proton will show a small, long-range coupling to the **two** equivalent equatorial protons on these carbons, which are in a \"W\" or zig-zag arrangement conducive to ⁴J coupling.\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** The primary splitting is into a doublet due to the single adjacent methine proton (³J). Each peak of this doublet is then further split into a triplet by the two equivalent long-range coupled protons (⁴J). This results in a **doublet of triplets** pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a known skeletal rearrangement of the adamantane cage. Under these conditions (strong base, high temperature), 1,3-dihaloadamantanes rearrange to form protoadamantan-4-one. The adamantane skeleton is tricyclo[3.3.1.1³,⁷]decane, while the protoadamantane skeleton is tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decane.\n*   **Product 1:** Protoadamantan-4-one.\n    *   The provided spectroscopic data (¹H NMR: 4.79(2H), IR: 1720 cm⁻¹) is inconsistent with the known spectra of protoadamantan-4-one. However, the reaction itself is well-established in the chemical literature. We will proceed assuming Product 1 is indeed protoadamantan-4-one, as this is the expected chemical outcome.\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, a standard method for reducing ketones to alcohols using an aluminum alkoxide catalyst.\n*   **Product 2:** Protoadamantan-4-ol.\n\n### **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantan-4-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide ((CH₃)₂S).\n*   **Analysis:** While ozonolysis is typically used to cleave carbon-carbon double bonds, it can also cleave strained carbon-carbon single bonds in certain polycyclic systems. The protoadamantane skeleton is strained, and its reaction with ozone is a documented process. The ozonolysis of protoadamantan-4-ol, followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide, results in an oxidative cleavage of the C3-C8 bond and a subsequent rearrangement.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product of this specific ozonolytic rearrangement is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol-6-one**.\n\n### **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol-6-one. This molecule has a bicyclic framework containing a ketone at position 6 and an alcohol at position 2.\n*   **Most Deshielded Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C2) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm. Protons alpha to the ketone (at C5 and C7) are less deshielded.\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H-C2:** To determine the coupling pattern (splitting) of the H-C2 signal, we must identify its neighboring protons. H-C2 is coupled to:\n    1.  The single bridgehead proton at C1 (H-C1).\n    2.  The two diastereotopic protons on the adjacent methylene group at C3 (let's call them H-C3a and H-C3b).\n\n    The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists predominantly in a chair-chair conformation. Let's analyze the coupling constants (J-values) based on the dihedral angles between H-C2 and its neighbors:\n    *   **Coupling to H-C3 protons:** H-C2 will have a large trans-diaxial coupling (J ≈ 10-13 Hz) to one of the C3 protons and a smaller gauche (axial-equatorial) coupling (J ≈ 2-5 Hz) to the other C3 proton.\n    *   **Coupling to H-C1 proton:** The coupling between H-C2 and the bridgehead H-C1 is also a gauche interaction, resulting in a small coupling constant (J ≈ 2-5 Hz).\n\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** The signal for H-C2 is split by three neighboring protons with significantly different coupling constants. We have one large coupling and two smaller, coincidentally similar couplings.\n    1.  The large coupling to one of the H-C3 protons splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n    2.  Each peak of this doublet is then split by the other two protons (H-C1 and the other H-C3), which have small and similar J-values. Coupling to two protons with similar J-values results in a **triplet**.\n\n    Therefore, the overall pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Product 1\n\nThe reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with a strong base like KOH at high temperatures is known to cause a skeletal rearrangement. Specifically, this reaction can proceed via a Grob fragmentation. The initial step is likely the substitution of one bromine atom with a hydroxyl group, forming 1-bromo-3-hydroxyadamantane. The subsequent formation of an alkoxide under basic conditions triggers the fragmentation of the adamantane cage, leading to the formation of **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\nThis structure for Product 1 is consistent with the provided spectroscopic data:\n*   **Formula**: C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **IR Spectrum**: An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The two protons of the exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) are vinylic and account for the signal at 4.79 ppm (2H). The remaining 12 protons of the bicyclic framework correspond to the signals at 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n\n### Step 2: Identification of Product 2\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol without affecting the carbon-carbon double bond. Therefore, Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Identification of Product 3\n\nProduct 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at C7 and formaldehyde (which is removed during workup). The alcohol group at C3 remains unchanged. Thus, Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\nWe need to identify the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one) and determine its coupling pattern.\n\n1.  **Most Deshielded Proton**: In this keto-alcohol, the possible non-exchangeable protons are those on the bicyclic framework. The proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded. Its chemical shift is typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm, which is significantly further downfield than the protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8, ~2.5-3.0 ppm) and other aliphatic protons.\n\n2.  **Coupling Pattern of H-C3**: The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system in Product 3 exists predominantly in a chair-chair conformation. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7. The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Each of these positions (C2 and C4) is a methylene group (CH₂), so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling of H-C3 to the two protons on C2 is equivalent to its coupling to the two protons on C4.\n    *   Within each methylene group (e.g., C2), the two protons (axial and equatorial) are not equivalent and will have different coupling constants (J-values) to H-C3. Let's denote the coupling to the two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) as J_A and the coupling to the two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) as J_B.\n    *   In a chair conformation, the axial-axial coupling constant (J_A) is typically large (~10-13 Hz), while the axial-equatorial coupling constant (J_B) is small (~2-5 Hz).\n    *   Since H-C3 couples to two equivalent protons with a constant J_A and to another two equivalent protons with a different constant J_B, the resulting splitting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
