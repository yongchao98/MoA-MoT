The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can know both the energy of a particle and the time for which it has that energy.\n\nThe relationship is given by:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also known as the natural linewidth or energy width of the state).\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which we can take as the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor an energy level to be well-defined, its uncertainty (ΔE) must be small. A finite lifetime (τ) leads to a non-zero energy uncertainty.\n\nLet's calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, their energy difference, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV), and this width is the primary factor limiting our ability to resolve the levels.\n\nTherefore, the required energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two widths:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\nA) 10⁻⁴ eV\nB) 10⁻⁹ eV\nC) 10⁻⁸ eV\nD) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n\nComparing these options to our required condition (|E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV):\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is large enough to be resolved.\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is not resolvable.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is not resolvable.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is not resolvable.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy separation large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, as it is significantly larger than the natural energy broadening caused by their finite lifetimes.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo clearly distinguish between two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as it applies to energy and time.\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time is given by the relation: ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π). This principle implies that a state with a finite lifetime cannot have a perfectly defined energy. The shorter the lifetime of a state, the larger the uncertainty in its energy.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE) for each quantum state. We can approximate the minimum uncertainty using ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\nThe value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in electron-volts seconds (eV·s) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFor the first state (State 1):\n*   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nFor the second state (State 2):\n*   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference (ΔE_diff) must be significantly larger than the individual energy uncertainties. A common criterion for resolvability is that the energy difference should be at least the sum of the individual energy uncertainties:\n\nΔE_diff > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\nΔE_diff > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\nΔE_diff > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV + 0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\nΔE_diff > 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow, let's examine the given options to see which one satisfies this condition:\n\nA) 10⁻¹¹ eV\nB) 10⁻⁸ eV\nC) 10⁻⁹ eV\nD) 10⁻⁴ eV\n\nComparing our calculated minimum energy difference with the options:\n*   10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nTherefore, an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV would be sufficient to clearly distinguish these two energy levels.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a quantum state (Δt or τ) to the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is given by ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ, where ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant. This means a state with a shorter lifetime has a larger \"spread\" or uncertainty in its energy.\n\n2.  **Establish the Condition for Resolution:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (or \"widths\"). So, the condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.\n\n3.  **Calculate Energy Uncertainties:**\n    *   I will use the value of the reduced Planck constant in electron-volt-seconds (eV·s), which is approximately ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s. This avoids an extra conversion step from Joules.\n    *   I will calculate the energy uncertainty for the first state (ΔE1) using its lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    *   I will calculate the energy uncertainty for the second state (ΔE2) using its lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s.\n\n4.  **Determine Minimum Energy Difference:**\n    *   I will sum the two energy uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2) to find the minimum energy difference required to resolve the two levels.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   I will compare this calculated minimum energy difference with the four given options (A, B, C, D).\n    *   The correct option will be the one that is significantly larger than the calculated minimum required separation.\n\n6.  **Final Output:** The code will print the step-by-step calculations and then identify the correct choice from the list.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given values\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582e-16  \n# Lifetime of the first state in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9  \n# Lifetime of the second state in seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  \n\n# The options for the energy difference in eV\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-8,\n    \"C\": 1e-4,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\n\nprint(\"This problem uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\")\nprint(\"The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the lifetime of a state (τ) are related by ΔE * τ ≈ ħ.\")\nprint(\"To clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (widths).\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state\n# ΔE = ħ / τ\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 1 (τ1): {tau1:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 2 (τ2): {tau2:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the minimum required energy difference for resolution\n# The condition is |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\nmin_energy_diff = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(\"The minimum energy difference required to resolve the two states is the sum of their uncertainties:\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required difference = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = {min_energy_diff:.3e} eV\\n\")\n\n# Step 4: Compare the minimum required difference with the given options\nprint(\"Now, we check which option is greater than this minimum required difference:\")\ncorrect_option = None\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    is_resolvable = value > min_energy_diff\n    print(f\"Option {option}) {value:.1e} eV: Is it > {min_energy_diff:.3e} eV? -> {is_resolvable}\")\n    if is_resolvable:\n        correct_option = option\n\nprint(f\"\\nBased on the calculations, the only energy difference large enough to resolve the two states is option {correct_option}.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer Choice: {correct_option}\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: This problem uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the lifetime of a state (τ) are related by ΔE * τ ≈ ħ.\nTo clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (widths).\n\nLifetime of state 1 (τ1): 1.0e-09 s\nEnergy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\n\nLifetime of state 2 (τ2): 1.0e-08 s\nEnergy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\n\nThe minimum energy difference required to resolve the two states is the sum of their uncertainties:\nMinimum required difference = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 7.240e-07 eV\n\nNow, we check which option is greater than this minimum required difference:\nOption A) 1.0e-11 eV: Is it > 7.240e-07 eV? -> False\nOption B) 1.0e-08 eV: Is it > 7.240e-07 eV? -> False\nOption C) 1.0e-04 eV: Is it > 7.240e-07 eV? -> True\nOption D) 1.0e-09 eV: Is it > 7.240e-07 eV? -> False\n\nBased on the calculations, the only energy difference large enough to resolve the two states is option C.\nFinal Answer Choice: C\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the required energy difference to resolve the two quantum states.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The problem involves the lifetime of quantum states and the ability to distinguish their energies. This directly relates to the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n2.  **State the Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The formula is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the natural linewidth.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n3.  **Understand the Concept of \"Resolving\" Energy Levels:** For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or \"distinguished,\" the difference in their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths (ΔE1 and ΔE2). If the energy difference is smaller than or comparable to the energy widths, the levels will overlap and appear as a single, broad peak. The level with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this width is the primary limiting factor for resolution.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime, Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ sec\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime, Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ sec\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\n    *   We have two energy widths: ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE2 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   State 1 has a shorter lifetime, so it has a larger energy uncertainty (it is \"broader\"). This broader width is the main obstacle to resolving the two levels.\n    *   To clearly distinguish the two levels, their energy separation |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger of the two widths. A good rule of thumb is that the separation should be at least as large as the sum of the widths, but as a minimum condition, it must be larger than the broadest level.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is: **|E1 - E2| > ΔE1**\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Given Options:** We need to find the option that satisfies the condition |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would completely overlap. Not resolvable.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would still overlap significantly. Not clearly resolvable.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is even smaller and thus not resolvable.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is much larger than the required minimum separation (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV). With this energy difference, the two levels would be very clearly separated, as their natural widths would be negligible in comparison to their separation.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Uncertainty Principle:** The core of the problem is the inverse relationship between lifetime and energy uncertainty. A shorter lifetime implies a larger, more uncertain energy.\n*   **Limiting Factor:** The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width and is therefore the limiting factor in resolving the two levels.\n*   **\"Clearly Resolved\" Condition:** This means the separation must be significantly greater than the energy widths, not just equal to or slightly larger.\n*   **Units:** Ensure consistent units. The Planck constant was used in eV·s to directly obtain the energy uncertainty in eV, which matches the units of the options.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe energy width of the broader state is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. To clearly resolve the two states, their energy difference must be significantly larger than this value. Among the given options, only 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty in its energy.\n\n**1.

A common form of this relationship is ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).

A common criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the broader of the two linewidths. In this case, the first state has a shorter lifetime, which results in a larger energy width (ΔE1 > ΔE2).\n    *   The condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options**: We compare the given options with this condition:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly greater than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved, as it is much larger than the natural linewidth of the broader state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

This directly relates to the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n2.  **State the Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The formula is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the natural linewidth.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n3.  **Understand the Concept of \"Resolving\" Energy Levels:** For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or \"distinguished,\" the difference in their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths (ΔE1 and ΔE2). If the energy difference is smaller than or comparable to the energy widths, the levels will overlap and appear as a single, broad peak. The level with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this width is the primary limiting factor for resolution.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime, Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ sec\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime, Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ sec\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\n    *   We have two energy widths: ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE2 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   State 1 has a shorter lifetime, so it has a larger energy uncertainty (it is \"broader\"). This broader width is the main obstacle to resolving the two levels.\n    *   To clearly distinguish the two levels, their energy separation |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger of the two widths. A good rule of thumb is that the separation should be at least as large as the sum of the widths, but as a minimum condition, it must be larger than the broadest level.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is: **|E1 - E2| > ΔE1**\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Given Options:** We need to find the option that satisfies the condition |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would completely overlap. Not resolvable.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would still overlap significantly. Not clearly resolvable.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is even smaller and thus not resolvable.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is much larger than the required minimum separation (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV). With this energy difference, the two levels would be very clearly separated, as their natural widths would be negligible in comparison to their separation.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Uncertainty Principle:** The core of the problem is the inverse relationship between lifetime and energy uncertainty. A shorter lifetime implies a larger, more uncertain energy.\n*   **Limiting Factor:** The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width and is therefore the limiting factor in resolving the two levels.\n*   **\"Clearly Resolved\" Condition:** This means the separation must be significantly greater than the energy widths, not just equal to or slightly larger.\n*   **Units:** Ensure consistent units. The Planck constant was used in eV·s to directly obtain the energy uncertainty in eV, which matches the units of the options.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe energy width of the broader state is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. To clearly resolve the two states, their energy difference must be significantly larger than this value. Among the given options, only 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty in its energy.\n\n**1.

This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle is given by the relation:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy (the natural linewidth of the energy level).\n*   **Δt** is the lifetime of the quantum state.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nA quantum state that exists for only a short time cannot have a definite energy. The lifetime of the state (τ) can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, we can calculate the energy uncertainty for each level using a simplified form of the relation, ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\n**1. Calculate the energy uncertainty for the first state (E1):**\n*   Lifetime (τ₁): 10⁻⁹ s\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**2. Calculate the energy uncertainty for the second state (E2):**\n*   Lifetime (τ₂): 10⁻⁸ s\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them, |E1 - E2|, must be significantly larger than the broader of the two linewidths. The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than this value.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two levels, as it is several orders of magnitude greater than the energy uncertainty of the broader state.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo clearly distinguish between two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties, a concept rooted in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of a quantum state is inversely related to its lifetime (Δt or τ).\n\nThe time-energy uncertainty principle can be expressed as:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor practical purposes, the energy width or uncertainty (ΔE) of a state with lifetime τ can be approximated as:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n**For the first state (E1):**\n*   Lifetime (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**For the second state (E2):**\n*   Lifetime (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference between the two levels (|E₁ - E₂|) must be significantly larger than the sum of their energy uncertainties (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂). The state with the shorter lifetime has a broader energy level, which is the primary factor limiting resolution.\n\nThe total energy uncertainty is approximately the uncertainty of the broader level, which is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, the energy difference must be substantially greater than this value.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) 10⁻⁸ eV (Smaller than the uncertainty of either state)\nB) 10⁻⁴ eV (Significantly larger than the calculated total uncertainty)\nC) 10⁻¹¹ eV (Much smaller than the uncertainty of either state)\nD) 10⁻⁹ eV (Smaller than the uncertainty of the first state)\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference that is several orders of magnitude larger than the inherent energy width of the states, ensuring they can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the natural energy width (also called linewidth) of each level. This requirement stems from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: The energy-time uncertainty principle states that the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) are related. A common form of this relationship is ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This means a state with a finite lifetime cannot have a perfectly defined energy; there is an inherent \"smearing\" or width to its energy level.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Width of Each State**: The lifetime (τ) of the state can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, the minimum energy uncertainty, or the natural linewidth (ΔE), can be estimated as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n    *   **For the first state (E1)**:\n        *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For the second state (E2)**:\n        *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolution**: To clearly distinguish two energy levels, their energy separation must be larger than their energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the broader of the two linewidths. In this case, the first state has a shorter lifetime, which results in a larger energy width (ΔE1 > ΔE2).\n    *   The condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options**: We compare the given options with this condition:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly greater than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved, as it is much larger than the natural linewidth of the broader state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
