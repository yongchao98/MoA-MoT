    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be Y_mF_n. The mass fraction is given by:\n\nɷF = (n * M_F) / (m * M_Y + n * M_F) = 0.3196\n\nWhere M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M_Y is the molar mass of element Y.\nAssuming the simplest case where m=1, the formula is YF_n.\n\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n\nRearranging for M_Y:\n0.3196 * (M_Y + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n0.3196 * M_Y = 19.00n - (0.3196 * 19.00n)\n0.3196 * M_Y = 19.00n * (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 * M_Y = 12.9276n\nM_Y = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\nM_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe now test integer values of n to find a plausible element Y from the periodic table.\n*   If n = 1, M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, Ca = 40.08 g/mol).\n*   If n = 2, M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Bromine, Br = 79.90 g/mol).\n*   If n = 3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb = 121.76 g/mol).\n*   If n = 4, M_Y ≈ 161.80 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, Dy = 162.50 g/mol).\n*   If n = 5, M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Mercury, Hg = 200.59 g/mol, or Bismuth, Bi = 208.98 g/mol).\n*   If n = 6, M_Y ≈ 242.70 g/mol (very close to Plutonium, Pu = 244 g/mol).\n\nLet's verify the most likely candidates by calculating the exact mass fraction.\n*   For Y=Sb and A2=SbF3: ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (31.88%). This is a very close match to 31.96%.\n*   For Y=Pu and A2=PuF6: ɷF = (6 * 19.00) / (244 + 6 * 19.00) = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 (31.84%). This is also a very close match.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Candidates using Other Information**\n\nLet's evaluate both Sb and Pu based on the other clues.\n\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y and interacts with xenon.**\n    *   For Y=Sb: Sb is fluorinated to SbF5. So, A3 = SbF5. SbF5 is a powerful Lewis acid and a strong oxidizing agent known to react with xenon (e.g., Xe + 2SbF5 → [XeF]+[Sb2F11]−). This fits.\n    *   For Y=Pu: Pu is fluorinated to PuF6. So, A3 = PuF6. PuF6 is a very strong oxidizing agent and is expected to react with xenon. This also fits.\n\n*   **A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine (A1 → A2 + F2).**\n    *   For Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. The reaction would be A1 → SbF3 + F2. By conservation of atoms, A1 must be SbF5. However, SbF5 is very stable and does not decompose this way; in fact, the reverse reaction (SbF3 + F2 → SbF5) is favored. This presents a contradiction.\n    *   For Y=Pu, A2=PuF6. The reaction would be A1 → PuF6 + F2. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of plutonium (e.g., PuF8), which is not known to exist. This also presents a contradiction.\n\nGiven that chemical puzzles can sometimes contain simplified or slightly inaccurate descriptions, the strong quantitative match for Y=Sb and A2=SbF3 is the most compelling piece of evidence. Let's proceed with Y=Sb, assuming there's an issue with the description of A1's reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance A4**\n\nWe have concluded that Y is Antimony (Sb). The problem mentions five binary compounds of fluorine with Y. The two most common are Antimony Trifluoride (SbF3) and Antimony Pentafluoride (SbF5). Substance A4 must be one of these compounds.\n\nWe need to determine if A4 is SbF3 or SbF5. The question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of A4 falls. Let's calculate the molecular weights of our two candidates.\n\n*   **Molecular Weight of SbF3:**\n    MW(SbF3) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n\n*   **Molecular Weight of SbF5:**\n    MW(SbF5) = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's check which of the calculated molecular weights falls into the given ranges.\n\n*   A) 160-180\n*   B) 110-130\n*   C) 220-240\n*   D) 140-160\n\n*   The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls squarely within range **A) 160-180**.\n*   The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the ranges. It is close to range C, but it is less than 220.\n\nBased on this, substance A4 must be SbF3. The other information (about the formation of A5 and its decomposition) is consistent with this choice. For instance, the reaction SbF3 + Sb → Sb2F3 (A5) is a 1:1 molar reaction. The product, a subfluoride with an average oxidation state of +1.5, would decompose in water via disproportionation to Sb(0) and Sb(III), forming two substances, which matches the description.\n\n```python\nM_F = 18.9984\nM_Sb = 121.760\n\n# Calculate the molecular weight of the two main antimony fluorides\nMW_SbF3 = M_Sb + 3 * M_F\nMW_SbF5 = M_Sb + 5 * M_F\n\nprint(f\"Molecular Weight of SbF3: {MW_SbF3:.2f} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Molecular Weight of SbF5: {MW_SbF5:.2f} g/mol\")\n\n# Given ranges:\n# A) 160-180\n# B) 110-130\n# C) 220-240\n# D) 140-160\n\n# Check which range MW_SbF3 falls into\nif 160 <= MW_SbF3 <= 180:\n    print(\"MW of SbF3 is in range A.\")\nelif 110 <= MW_SbF3 <= 130:\n    print(\"MW of SbF3 is in range B.\")\nelif 220 <= MW_SbF3 <= 240:\n    print(\"MW of SbF3 is in range C.\")\nelif 140 <= MW_SbF3 <= 160:\n    print(\"MW of SbF3 is in range D.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"MW of SbF3 is not in any range.\")\n\n# Check which range MW_SbF5 falls into\nif 160 <= MW_SbF5 <= 180:\n    print(\"MW of SbF5 is in range A.\")\nelif 110 <= MW_SbF5 <= 130:\n    print(\"MW of SbF5 is in range B.\")\nelif 220 <= MW_SbF5 <= 240:\n    print(\"MW of SbF5 is in range C.\")\nelif 140 <= MW_SbF5 <= 160:\n    print(\"MW of SbF5 is in range D.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"MW of SbF5 is not in any range.\")\n```\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 is 178.76 g/mol, which falls in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a multi-step chemistry problem that requires identifying an unknown element and its compounds based on chemical properties and quantitative data.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\nThe first crucial piece of information is the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2 (ɷF = 31.96%). Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nThe formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is:\nɷF = (n × M_F) / (M_Y + n × M_F)\n\nWhere:\n*   M_F is the molar mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol)\n*   M_Y is the molar mass of element Y.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for M_Y:\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M_Y + n × 19.00)\n0.3196 × (M_Y + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n0.3196 × M_Y + 6.0724n = 19.00n\n0.3196 × M_Y = 12.9276n\nM_Y = (12.9276 / 0.3196) × n\nM_Y ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nNow, we test integer values for n to find a corresponding element from the periodic table:\n*   If n = 1, M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, Ca)\n*   If n = 2, M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Bromine, Br)\n*   If n = 3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to **Antimony, Sb**, with M = 121.76 g/mol)\n*   If n = 4, M_Y ≈ 161.80 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, Dy)\n*   If n = 5, M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Mercury, Hg)\n\nLet's check the mass fraction for SbF3 (n=3):\nɷF = (3 × 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 × 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is a very close match to the given 31.96%.\n\nThe other clues support Antimony (Sb) as element Y:\n*   \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is a known very strong oxidizing agent and Lewis acid that reacts with xenon to form compounds like [XeF]+[Sb2F11]−. This makes SbF5 a candidate for A1 or A3.\n*   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\" The reaction Sb + F2 → SbF5 is a standard synthesis. This points to A3 being SbF5.\n\nThus, we can confidently identify **Y as Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 as SbF3**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4**\n\nThe problem asks for the range of the molecular weight of substance A4. The most common binary fluorides of antimony are Antimony Trifluoride (SbF3) and Antimony Pentafluoride (SbF5). A4 must be one of these.\n\nWe need to calculate their molecular weights:\n*   **Molecular Weight of SbF3:**\n    MW(SbF3) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n*   **Molecular Weight of SbF5:**\n    MW(SbF5) = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F) = 121.76 + 5 × 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**\n\n**Step 3: Compare with the Answer Choices**\n\nNow we check which of these molecular weights fits into the given ranges:\nA) 160-180\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\n*   The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls within the range of **160-180**.\n*   The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the given ranges.\n\nTherefore, substance A4 must be SbF3.\n\nThe final piece of information confirms this: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 (SbF3), A5 can be obtained.\" This describes the formation of an antimony sub-fluoride, which is consistent with known antimony chemistry.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is approximately 178.76 g/mol, which falls in the range 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>"
