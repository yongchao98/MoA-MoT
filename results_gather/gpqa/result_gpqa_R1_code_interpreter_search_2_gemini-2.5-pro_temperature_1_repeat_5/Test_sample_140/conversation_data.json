    "This problem involves an elimination-addition reaction mechanism, specifically proceeding through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the active species is the amide ion, NH₂⁻).\n\n**2. Mechanism: Elimination to form Benzyne**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and removes a hydrogen (or deuterium) from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** Has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** Has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is generally faster than removing a deuteron because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 induces the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains untouched at the C2 position. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This process is slower than proton abstraction but still occurs.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 induces the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is now part of a deuterated ammonia molecule (NH₂D) in the solvent. The benzyne intermediate itself is **unlabeled benzyne**.\n\nSo, we have two different benzyne intermediates forming simultaneously: **3-deuteriobenzyne** and **unlabeled benzyne**.\n\n**3. Mechanism: Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (which contains both NH₃ and some NH₂D).\n\n*   **Reactions of 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond. The subsequent carbanion is protonated by the abundant solvent, NH₃.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** NH₂ adds to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH₃ yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the amino group is at C1, and the deuterium is at C2).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** NH₂ adds to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH₃ yields a product with NH₂ at C6 and D at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the amino group the #1 position, the deuterium is at position C3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Reactions of unlabeled benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The nucleophile NH₂⁻ attacks the symmetrical C1-C2 triple bond. Let's say it attacks C1, forming a carbanion at C2. This carbanion is then quenched by a molecule from the solvent pool, which contains both NH₃ and NH₂D (formed in Pathway B).\n    *   **Quenched by NH₃:** A proton (H⁺) is transferred from NH₃ to the carbanion. The final product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n    *   **Quenched by NH₂D:** A deuteron (D⁺) is transferred from NH₂D to the carbanion. The final product has an NH₂ group at C1 and a D at C2, which is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\n**4. Summary of all Possible Products**\nBy combining the products from all possible reaction pathways, we identify the unique organic products formed:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A and Pathway B)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of three possible distinct organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
