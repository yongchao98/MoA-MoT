    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of the given organic molecule. The standard formula for calculating ΔHf using bond energies is:\nΔHf = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of constituent elements in standard state) - (Sum of bond energies of the compound)\n\n**2. Analyze the Molecule**\nThe molecule is given by the condensed structural formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Step 2a: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n    We need to count the number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n    - C atoms: (1 C + 2 C in (CH3)2) + (1 C in CH) + (1 C in CH2) + (1 C + 1 C in CH(CH3)) + (1 C in CH2) + (1 C in CH) + (1 C + 2 C in C(CH3)2) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 C atoms**.\n    - H atoms: (2 * 3 H in (CH3)2) + (1 H in CH) + (2 H in CH2) + (1 H + 3 H in CH(CH3)) + (2 H in CH2) + (1 H in CH) + (2 * 3 H in C(CH3)2) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H atoms**.\n    - The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n    We need to count the C-H, C-C (single), and C=C (double) bonds by examining the structure.\n    - **C-H bonds**: The count is simply the total number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    - **C=C bonds**: The structure shows two double bonds (`=`). So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n    - **C-C bonds**: These are all the single bonds between carbon atoms. Let's count them systematically:\n        - In the (CH3)2C= group, the central carbon is bonded to two CH3 groups: **2** C-C bonds.\n        - The bond between the `=CH-` group and the `-CH2-` group: **1** C-C bond.\n        - The bond between the `-CH2-` group and the `-CH(CH3)-` group: **1** C-C bond.\n        - In the `-CH(CH3)-` group, the backbone carbon is bonded to a CH3 group: **1** C-C bond.\n        - The bond between the `-CH(CH3)-` group and the next `-CH2-` group: **1** C-C bond.\n        - The bond between the `-CH2-` group and the `-CH=` group: **1** C-C bond.\n        - In the `=C(CH3)2` group, the central carbon is bonded to two CH3 groups: **2** C-C bonds.\n        - Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9** C-C bonds.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\nΔHa(compound) = (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C))\nGiven bond energies (BE):\nBE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\nBE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\nBE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n\nΔHa(compound) = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nΔHa(compound) = 8800 + 1800 + 600\nΔHa(compound) = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\nThis is the energy required to convert the constituent elements from their standard states (C as solid graphite, H as H2 gas) to gaseous atoms. The formation reaction is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nWe need to form 12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g).\n\nΔHa(elements) = (No. of C atoms × ΔHa(C)) + (No. of H2 moles × BE(H-H))\nΔHa(elements) = (12 × ΔHa(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\nGiven:\nΔHa(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\nBE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔHa(elements) = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΔHa(elements) = 12000 + 1100\nΔHa(elements) = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\nΔHf = ΔHa(elements) - ΔHa(compound)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert to Required Units (kJ/g)**\nThe options include answers in kJ/g. We need to convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass (M) ≈ (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\nΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.4457... kJ/g**\n\n**7.
