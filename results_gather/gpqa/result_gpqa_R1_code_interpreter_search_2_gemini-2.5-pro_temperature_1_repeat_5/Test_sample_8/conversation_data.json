    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### 1. Understanding C3h Symmetry\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has the following symmetry elements:\n*   A **C3 axis**: A three-fold axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n*   A **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n*   The presence of C3 and σh implies the existence of an **S3 improper rotation axis**.\n*   Crucially, a C3h molecule **lacks** any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and any vertical (σv) or dihedral (σd) mirror planes. The presence of these additional elements would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h or D3d.\n\n### 2. Analyzing Each Molecule\n\nLet's examine the structure and symmetry of each option:\n\n**A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring with three maleic anhydride-like groups fused to it.\n*   **Symmetry**: The molecule is planar.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   It also has three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the midpoints of the bonds of the central benzene ring.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes means the point group is D3. The addition of the σh plane makes the point group **D3h**. This is not C3h.\n\n**B) Quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure**: This is a bicyclic amine with the systematic name 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry**:\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (and its attached hydrogen).\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the three ethyl-like bridges.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes gives the point group **C3v**. This is not C3h.\n\n**C) Triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-iPr)3, or B(OCH(CH3)2)3. The central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is bonded to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Symmetry**: We need to consider its three-dimensional conformation. By analogy with boric acid (B(OH)3), which has C3h symmetry, the B and three O atoms are expected to be coplanar.\n    *   Let's assume a conformation where the central BO3 unit is planar. This plane can act as a potential σh.\n    *   For this to be a true σh plane, for each isopropyl group, the atoms must be arranged symmetrically with respect to this plane. A possible arrangement is where the C-H bond of the isopropyl group lies *in* the plane, with one methyl group (CH3) positioned above the plane and the other methyl group below it.\n    *   If all three isopropyl groups adopt this conformation and are arranged symmetrically around the boron atom, the molecule will have:\n        *   A **C3 axis** perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n        *   A **σh plane** (the BO3 plane itself), as it reflects the \"upper\" methyl group of each isopropyl unit onto the \"lower\" one.\n        *   No C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and no σv planes.\n    *   This conformation perfectly fits the requirements for the **C3h** point group. While other conformations with lower symmetry may exist due to free rotation, the molecule can readily adopt a C3h structure.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a large, polycyclic aromatic molecule. It has a triphenylene core with three furan-dione rings fused to its outer edges.\n*   **Symmetry**: The molecule is planar and highly symmetrical, resembling a three-bladed propeller.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The molecular plane is a σh plane.\n    *   It also has three C2 axes lying within the plane.\n    *   Like molecule A, the presence of C3, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane places it in the **D3h** point group. This is not C3h.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing all four molecules:\n*   Molecule A is D3h.\n*   Molecule B is C3v.\n*   Molecule C can adopt a stable conformation with C3h symmetry.\n*   Molecule D is D3h.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
