    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho, para-directing activating group. The nitration will yield a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance, the para-isomer is the major product. We will assume the reaction proceeds to form the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** para-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a methyl group (-CH₃) and a nitro group (-NO₂) in positions 1 and 4, respectively.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (4-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation reaction of the benzylic methyl group. While strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ would typically oxidize the methyl group to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), MnO₂ is often used as a milder oxidizing agent that can selectively oxidize benzylic positions to the aldehyde stage (-CHO) without further oxidation. Given the context of the subsequent reaction, it is most plausible that the oxidation stops at the aldehyde.\n*   **Product 2:** 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a formyl group (-CHO) and a nitro group (-NO₂) at positions 1 and 4, respectively.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (4-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂CO) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents corresponds to a base-catalyzed aldol condensation between an aldehyde that lacks α-hydrogens (4-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone that has α-hydrogens (acetone). This specific type of crossed aldol condensation is known as the **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) acts as a base, deprotonating the α-carbon of acetone to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion (⁻CH₂COCH₃).\n    2.  The acetone enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    3.  This addition reaction forms an alkoxide intermediate, which is then protonated by water to yield a β-hydroxy ketone (the aldol addition product).\n    4.  Under the reaction conditions (especially with base), this aldol product readily undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The final product is the condensation product.\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one.\n    *   Structure: NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃. The trans (E) isomer is sterically favored and more stable.\n\n**Step 4: Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n*   **Molecule:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one.\n*   **Analysis of Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   The molecule has an extended conjugated system (phenyl ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). To maximize orbital overlap, the molecule will adopt a conformation that is as planar as possible.\n    *   Let's assume the heavy atoms of the molecule (all C, N, O atoms) and the vinylic hydrogens (-CH=CH-) lie in a single plane.\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The plane containing the planar framework of the molecule (the nitrophenyl ring, the -CH=CH-C=O- chain) is a plane of symmetry. The methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the carbonyl has one hydrogen that can lie in this plane, with the other two positioned symmetrically above and below the plane. Therefore, the molecule possesses a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Rotational Axis (Cₙ, n>1):** There is no C₂ axis or any other rotational axis. Rotating the molecule 180° around any axis does not leave it unchanged.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nFinal Answer determination: The molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
