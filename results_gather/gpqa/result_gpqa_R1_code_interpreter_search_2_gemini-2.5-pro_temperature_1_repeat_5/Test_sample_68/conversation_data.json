    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Relativistic Decay**\n    The problem involves a relativistic particle ($X^0$) that decays. Due to time dilation, its lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). Consequently, the distance it travels before decaying (the decay length) is also longer. The decay process is probabilistic and follows an exponential decay law.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information**\n    *   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   Total energy of $X^0$ in the lab frame: $E = 27$ GeV.\n    *   Rest mass of $X^0$: $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n    *   Observation condition: We need to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Observation Condition**\n    A decay is \"observed\" in a detector like a bubble chamber if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution before it decays. Let the resolution be $L$. This means we can distinguish the creation point of $X^0$ from its decay point only if the decay length is greater than $L$.\n    The fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by the survival probability $P(\\text{distance} > x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n    The condition \"observe at least 30% of the decays\" translates to finding the resolution $L$ such that the fraction of particles decaying beyond this distance is at least 30%:\n    $e^{-L/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n    To find the required resolution, we consider the boundary case:\n    $e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-L/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n    The mean decay length is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$).\n    $\\lambda = v \\tau$\n    The lifetime in the lab frame is dilated: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    The Lorentz factor can be calculated from the total energy and rest mass energy:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n    The mean decay length can be expressed conveniently using $\\gamma$ and $\\tau_0$:\n    The particle's velocity is $v = c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n    So, $\\lambda = v \\tau = (c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2})(\\gamma \\tau_0) = c\\tau_0\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation**\n    Now, we substitute the given values into the formulas. A Python script can be used for precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given constants\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\ntau0 = 8e-16    # Proper lifetime in s\nE = 27          # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41     # Rest mass energy in GeV\n\n# 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# 2. Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame\n# lambda = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nmean_decay_length = c * tau0 * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# 3. Calculate the required resolution (L)\n# We need to find L such that exp(-L / mean_decay_length) = 0.30\n# L = -mean_decay_length * ln(0.30)\nL = -mean_decay_length * np.log(0.30)\n\nprint(f\"{L}\")\n```\nThe execution of the code will yield the numerical value for the minimum resolution $L$.\n\n2.268200655554359e-06\n\nThe calculated minimum resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**\n    The calculated value is $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    Let's look at the given options:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\n    Our calculated value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest to option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy (about 9%) is likely due to a minor inaccuracy in the values provided in the problem statement or the options. Based on the correct physical principles and calculations, option B is the most plausible answer.\n\n    Note on the wording: The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". A smaller resolution value (e.g., option A) would allow observing an even larger fraction of decays. The question likely means \"What is the largest resolution value (i.e., worst resolution) that allows observing at least 30% of decays?\". This boundary value is what we calculated ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). Any resolution $L_{res} \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m would satisfy the condition. Option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) satisfies this condition, and it is the closest value among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution before decaying.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Observation Probability to Decay Length:**\n    The decay of particles follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by the survival function:\n    $P(\\text{distance} > x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n    We need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means we are looking for a resolution, let's call it $L$, such that the probability of the decay length being greater than $L$ is at least 0.30.\n    $P(\\text{distance} > L) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-L/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n    The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". This usually refers to the boundary case, which represents the largest possible resolution (i.e., the worst detector) that still satisfies the condition. So, we solve for the equality:\n    $e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-L/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    The mean decay length in the lab frame is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$).\n    $\\lambda = v \\tau$\n\n    Due to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$):\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n    The Lorentz factor can be calculated from the particle's total energy ($E$) and its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$):\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n\n    The particle's velocity is given by $v = c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n\n    Combining these, we can express the mean decay length as:\n    $\\lambda = v \\tau = (c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}) (\\gamma \\tau_0) = c\\tau_0\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n3.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    First, let's calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.91788$\n\n    Next, we use this to find the required resolution $L$. The calculation involves several steps and is best done with a script for precision. The Python code generated in the thinking process performed exactly this calculation.\n\n    *   **Input values:**\n        *   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   Speed of light $c = 2.9979 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n        *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma \\approx 7.91788$\n    *   **Calculation from the code output:**\n        The code computed the mean decay length $\\lambda$ and then the resolution $L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$.\n        The result was $L \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated resolution is $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this to the given options:\n    A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\n    The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close to option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's given values or options. Based on the correct physical principles, option B is the most plausible answer. Any resolution smaller than our calculated value would also work (and would observe an even greater percentage of decays), but B is the closest available option that fulfills the condition.\n\n<<<B>>>"
