    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species:**\n    In a solution containing `Co(II)` ions and thiocyanate (`SCN-`), a series of complexation equilibria will be established. The cobalt-containing species are the free aquated ion `Co^2+` and the thiocyanato complexes: `[Co(SCN)]+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]2-`.\n\n2.  **Define the overall stability constants (β):**\n    The formation of these complexes from the free metal ion and ligand is described by the overall stability constants (βn):\n    *   `Co^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]+` ; `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]) = 9`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 2SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2]` ; `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) = 40`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 3SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]-` ; `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3) = 63`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 4SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]2-` ; `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]2-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\n3.  **Express concentrations in terms of free Co^2+:**\n    We can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co^2+]`, and the free ligand concentration, `[SCN-]`:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n4.  **Set up the mass balance for cobalt:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]`\n\n    Substituting the expressions from step 3:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the fraction (α) of the desired species:**\n    The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`. The fraction of this species, `α2`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Approximate the free ligand concentration:**\n    The total concentration of thiocyanate is `[SCN-]total = 0.1 M`, and the total concentration of cobalt is `c(Co) = 10^-2 M = 0.01 M`. Since the ligand concentration is ten times the metal ion concentration, the amount of ligand bound in complexes will be relatively small compared to the total ligand concentration. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]` as being equal to the total ligand concentration.\n    `[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n7.  **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    Now, we plug the given values into the equation for `α2`:\n    *   `[SCN-] = 0.1`\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n    Let's calculate the denominator (often denoted as Φ or P):\n    *   `Φ = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1^2) + (63 * 0.1^3) + (16 * 0.1^4)`\n    *   `Φ = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n    *   `Φ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    *   `Φ = 2.3646`\n\n    Now calculate the numerator for `α2`:\n    *   `Numerator = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n\n    Calculate `α2`:\n    *   `α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n8.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    Percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]` = `α2 * 100%`\n    Percentage = `0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\n    This value is very close to 16.9%.\n\nI will now use a Python script to verify the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Given ligand concentration\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-]\n\n# The term for the dithiocyanato complex in the distribution formula\nnumerator = beta2 * L**2\n\n# The sum of all terms in the distribution formula (denominator)\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * L + beta2 * L**2 + beta3 * L**3 + beta4 * L**4\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<execute_result>\n16.916180326482276\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species and equilibria:** The solution contains Co²⁺ and SCN⁻ ions. They form a series of complexes: [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species is `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`.\n\n2.  **Define the overall stability constants (βn):**\n    The formation reactions and their stability constants are:\n    *   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺`, `β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]`, `β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, `β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`, `β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n\n3.  **Formulate the mass balance for cobalt:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n4.  **Express all species in terms of [Co²⁺]:**\n    Using the stability constant expressions, we can write the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, and the free ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factoring out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the fraction (α₂) of the desired complex:**\n    We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`. The fraction of this species, `α₂`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n    Substituting the expressions from the steps above:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Approximate the free ligand concentration:**\n    The total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times the total metal concentration (0.01 M). In such cases, where the ligand is in significant excess, we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as being equal to the total ligand concentration.\n    So, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    Now we plug in the known values into the equation for `α₂`:\n    *   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1`\n    *   `β₁ = 9`, `β₂ = 40`, `β₃ = 63`, `β₄ = 16`\n\n    Let's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    The denominator is `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`.\n    The numerator is `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`.\n\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n8.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    Percentage = `α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`.\n\nThis result matches the value from the code execution (`16.91618...%`). Comparing this to the given options, the closest answer is 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
