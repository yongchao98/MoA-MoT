    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   The remaining degree of unsaturation is typically from a carbonyl group (C=O) or a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a **primary amine (-NH2)** group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of an **ester C=O stretch**. Amide carbonyls typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, appearing as a triplet. This is indicative of a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, appearing as a quartet. This indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). The high chemical shift (downfield) at 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom.\n    *   Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are a classic signature of an **ethyl group attached to an oxygen (-O-CH2CH3)**, which is consistent with an ethyl ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. This is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH2)** group, confirming the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group, and the protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to an electron-donating group.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group, and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n    *   The structure must be **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   Let's check this against the NMR aromatic signals. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group will be deshielded (appear at higher ppm), which corresponds to the 8.0 ppm doublet. The protons ortho to the electron-donating amino group will be shielded (appear at lower ppm), which corresponds to the 7.0 ppm doublet. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data (Formula, IR, and NMR).\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but it contains a propionate group (-O-CO-CH2CH3). The -CH2- next to the carbonyl would appear around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR (would show one N-H band) and NMR (would show one N-H proton, plus a formyl proton H-C=O). This is incorrect.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has a primary amide group (C=O stretch at ~1650 cm-1) and is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only compound that fits all the spectral data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
