    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the structure of the starting materials and the final product.**\n    The product in both reactions is a lactone: (R)- or (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. A lactone is a cyclic ester. \"Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" signifies a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (part of the ester) and a carbonyl group at position 2. The ring structure is O(1)-C(2)(=O)-C(3)H2-C(4)H(Et)-C(5)H2-C(6)H2. The chiral center is at C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\n    This six-membered lactone (a δ-lactone) is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. Specifically, it comes from 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-C(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH). The chiral center in this precursor acid is at C3, which becomes C4 in the lactone.\n\n    The proposed starting materials in the options are all stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This name describes a molecule that has both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. It is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n    The structure is: iBu-O-C(=O)-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH.\n    This molecule has two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). The chiral center is at C3, which corresponds to the C4 chiral center in the final lactone product.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1.**\n    *   Starting Material: A\n    *   Reagents: LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride), followed by H+ (acid workup).\n    *   Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n    We need to determine the selectivity of LiBH4 towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester. LiBH4 is a hydride reducing agent. When mixed with a carboxylic acid, an acid-base reaction occurs first, deprotonating the carboxylic acid to form a lithium carboxylate salt (R-COO- Li+). Carboxylate salts are very resistant to reduction by LiBH4. The ester group, however, is not acidic and will be reduced by the remaining LiBH4 to a primary alcohol.\n\n    The reaction sequence is as follows:\n    1.  A (iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH) + LiBH4 → Li+ -OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH + iBuOH\n        (The carboxylic acid is deprotonated, and the ester is reduced to a primary alcohol).\n    2.  H+ workup → HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n        (The carboxylate salt is protonated to give the 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n    3.  Lactonization (under acidic conditions from the workup) → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n    Throughout this reaction sequence, the reactions occur at the carboxylic acid and ester functional groups (C1 and C5 of the pentanedioic acid chain), not at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n    Since the final product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2.**\n    *   Starting Material: B\n    *   Reagents: BH3 (Borane), followed by H+.\n    *   Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n    We need to determine the selectivity of BH3. Borane is known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, being much faster at this than reducing esters.\n    The reaction sequence is as follows:\n    1.  B (iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH) + BH3 → iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n        (The carboxylic acid is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group intact. The product is a hydroxy-ester).\n    2.  H+ workup → The hydroxy-ester undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the cyclic ester (lactone).\n        iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH --(H+)--> (S)-lactone + iBuOH.\n\n    Again, the reactions occur at the carboxylic acid (C1) and ester (C5) positions, remote from the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n    Since the final product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Combine the results and select the correct option.**\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n    This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
