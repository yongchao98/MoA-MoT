    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information about the compound's structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents attached. The possible arrangements are ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** A benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n    *   **FTIR shows an aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) bonded directly to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the molecular structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents: a halogen (-X) and another group.\n    *   The total number of carbons in the substituents is 2.\n    *   The halogen substituent (-X) has 0 carbons.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A substituent with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   So, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n3.  **Consider the possible isomers:**\n    *   The two substituents (-X and -COCH3) can be arranged in ortho, meta, or para positions on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Ortho-haloacetophenone (1,2-):** Would have 4 distinct protons on the aromatic ring, leading to a complex spectrum with 4 signals.\n    *   **Meta-haloacetophenone (1,3-):** Would also have 4 distinct protons on the aromatic ring, leading to a complex spectrum with 4 signals.\n    *   **Para-haloacetophenone (1,4-):** This isomer has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):**\n        *   There are two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n        *   The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be deshielded (shifted downfield) and appear as one signal.\n        *   The two protons ortho to the halogen group will be slightly less deshielded and appear as a second signal.\n        *   Each proton is coupled only to its ortho neighbor (from the other set). This results in a splitting pattern of two doublets.\n        *   So, we expect to see two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent.\n        *   They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will not be split.\n        *   We expect to see a singlet integrating to 3H. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone attached to an aromatic ring is around 2.5 ppm.\n\n5.  **Analyze the given 1H NMR data options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integration of the upfield singlet is 2H, not 3H as required for a -CH3 group. The chemical shifts at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not typical for aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone. An aldehyde would mean the substituents are -CHO and -CH3 to get 2 carbons, but this contradicts the \"aromatic-halogen bond\" information. It would also be a tri-substituted ring (halo, methyl, formyl), which contradicts the \"di-substituted\" information. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct answer for an aromatic compound.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4- (para) disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   **Aliphatic region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a singlet for 3 protons, which perfectly matches the methyl group of an acetyl substituent (-COCH3). The chemical shift is reasonable.\n        *   **Total Protons:** 2 + 2 + 3 = 7H, which matches the expected number of protons in C8H7XO.\n        *   This option perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option D is fully consistent with this structure, showing the characteristic pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region for para-substitution and a singlet for the acetyl methyl group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
