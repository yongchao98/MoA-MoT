    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System and the Partition Function**\n    The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n    The total number of possible configurations (microstates) is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n    The energy of the system for a given configuration is given by the Hamiltonian:\n    E = -J [S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n    The partition function (Z) is a fundamental quantity in statistical mechanics that describes the statistical properties of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. It is defined as the sum of the Boltzmann factors over all possible microstates of the system:\n    Z = Σ_states exp(-βE)\n    where β = 1/(kT), k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Enumerate All Possible States and Calculate Their Energies**\n    We need to list all 8 possible configurations of (S1, S2, S3) and calculate the energy E for each one.\n\n    *   **State 1: All spins up (+1, +1, +1)**\n        E1 = -J [(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n    *   **State 2: All spins down (-1, -1, -1)**\n        E2 = -J [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n    *   **State 3: Two spins up, one spin down (+1, +1, -1)**\n        E3 = -J [(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        By symmetry, the other two configurations with two spins up and one spin down will have the same energy:\n        *   (+1, -1, +1): E = -J [(-1) + (+1) + (-1)] = J\n        *   (-1, +1, +1): E = -J [(-1) + (-1) + (+1)] = J\n\n    *   **State 4: One spin up, two spins down (+1, -1, -1)**\n        E4 = -J [(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        By symmetry, the other two configurations with one spin up and two spins down will also have the same energy:\n        *   (-1, +1, -1): E = -J [(-1) + (+1) + (-1)] = J\n        *   (-1, -1, +1): E = -J [(+1) + (-1) + (-1)] = J\n\n3.  **Group by Energy Levels and Find Degeneracies**\n    Now, we group the states that have the same energy level and count how many states belong to each level. This count is called the degeneracy (g).\n\n    *   **Energy Level E = -3J:**\n        This energy level corresponds to two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n        The degeneracy is g(-3J) = 2.\n\n    *   **Energy Level E = J:**\n        This energy level corresponds to the remaining six states (three states with two spins up and one down, and three states with one spin up and two down).\n        The degeneracy is g(J) = 6.\n\n    The sum of degeneracies is 2 + 6 = 8, which is the total number of states, so our counting is correct.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Partition Function**\n    The partition function Z is the sum of the degeneracies multiplied by their respective Boltzmann factors:\n    Z = g(-3J) * exp(-β * (-3J)) + g(J) * exp(-β * J)\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    Let's compare our result with the given choices:\n    A) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n    B) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    C) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n    D) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\n    Our calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
