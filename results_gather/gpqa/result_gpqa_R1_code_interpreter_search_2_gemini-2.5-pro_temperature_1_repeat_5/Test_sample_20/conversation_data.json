    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n    2.  Let's examine **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons.\n        *   Each of these alpha-carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning they each have two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   Because it has alpha-hydrogens, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it tautomerizes to form phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and very stable compound. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n    3.  Now, let's examine **benzoquinone** (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone).\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds: O=C-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH=CH-.\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds.\n        *   These alpha-carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.\n        *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone *cannot* undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    2.  Let's examine **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's look at the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group.\n        *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n            1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n            2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n            3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n        *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n        *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and *will show* optical isomerism.\n\n    3.  Now, let's examine **dimethyl fumarate**.\n        *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (this is the *trans* isomer).\n        *   The molecule contains a C=C double bond. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there is no chiral center.\n        *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate *will not show* optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer**\n\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
