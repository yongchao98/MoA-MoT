    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in 2D polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation more easily, we should express the potential in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    x = r cos(θ)\n    y = r sin(θ)\n    r² = x² + y²\n\n    From these relationships, we can see that:\n    r² cos²(θ) = (r cos(θ))² = x²\n\n    Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k (x² + y²) + 3/2 k (x²)\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Combine the terms with x² and y²:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 kx² + 3/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²\n    V(x, y) = (4/2) kx² + 1/2 ky²\n    V(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n4.  **Identify the Form of the Potential:**\n    The simplified potential V(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky² is the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where:\n    V_x(x) = 2kx²\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\n5.  **Solve the Separable Schrödinger Equation:**\n    Since the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent 1D equations, one for x and one for y. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from each dimension, E = E_x + E_y.\n\n6.  **Find the Energy for the x-direction (E_x):**\n    The potential for the x-direction is V_x(x) = 2kx². The standard form for a 1D harmonic oscillator potential is 1/2 mω²x².\n    Comparing the two forms:\n    1/2 mω_x²x² = 2kx²\n    mω_x² = 4k\n    ω_x² = 4k/m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω. For the x-direction, with quantum number n_x:\n    E_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n7.  **Find the Energy for the y-direction (E_y):**\n    The potential for the y-direction is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky². This is already in the standard form 1/2 mω²y².\n    Comparing the two forms:\n    1/2 mω_y²y² = 1/2 ky²\n    mω_y² = k\n    ω_y² = k/m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-direction, with quantum number n_y:\n    E_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum (E):**\n    The total energy is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Now, factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The quantum numbers n_x and n_y can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n9.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m).\n    This matches option C.\n\n    A) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    D) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
