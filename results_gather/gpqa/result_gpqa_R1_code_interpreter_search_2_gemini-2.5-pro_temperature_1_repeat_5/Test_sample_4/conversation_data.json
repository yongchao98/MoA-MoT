    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ along a specific direction $\\vec{n}$, corresponding to a given eigenvalue.\n\n2.  **Define the Operator and its Components:** The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ in terms of the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$) and Planck's constant $\\hbar$.\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    This operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, usually denoted as $\\vec{S}$.\n\n3.  **Define the Direction Vector:** The direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary direction lying in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, any vector in the x-z plane has an azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$. Let $\\theta$ be the polar angle (the angle with the z-axis). The unit vector $\\vec{n}$ can be written in Cartesian coordinates as:\n    *   $n_x = \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi = \\sin\\theta \\cos(0) = \\sin\\theta$\n    *   $n_y = \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = \\sin\\theta \\sin(0) = 0$\n    *   $n_z = \\cos\\theta$\n    So, the direction vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n4.  **Construct the Operator Along Direction $\\vec{n}$:** The operator for the component of $\\vec{P}$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    *   $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    *   $P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y) (0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$\n    *   $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, substitute the matrix representations:\n    *   $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    *   $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta) & (1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta) \\\\ (1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta) & (0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta - 1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:** We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$, where the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is given as $+\\hbar/2$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Eigenvector:** We can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides of the equation.\n    *   $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n    1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    From equation (1):\n    *   $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    *   $b = a \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    To simplify this expression, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    *   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    *   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b$:\n    *   $b = a \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    So, the unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n7.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:** The eigenvector must be normalized, meaning its norm (length) is 1. The condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n    *   $|a|^2 + |a \\tan(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n    *   $|a|^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n    *   $|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    *   $|a|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n    By convention, we can choose $a$ to be real and positive, so $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n\n    Now we find $b$:\n    *   $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    *   $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n8.  **Final Answer:** The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds to option A.\n\nWe can quickly verify the result. For $\\theta=0$, $\\vec{n}$ is along the z-axis, $P_n=P_z$. The eigenvector should be the spin-up state along z, which is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Our formula gives $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(0) \\\\ \\sin(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is correct.\nFor $\\theta=\\pi/2$, $\\vec{n}$ is along the x-axis, $P_n=P_x$. The eigenvector should be the spin-up state along x, which is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Our formula gives $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\pi/4) \\\\ \\sin(\\pi/4) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix}$. This is also correct.\n\nThe calculation is robust.\n\n<<<A>>>"
