    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the reactants and their nature:**\n*   `CH3COOH` (Acetic Acid): This is a weak acid.\n*   `HCl` (Hydrochloric Acid): This is a strong acid.\n*   `Ba(OH)2` (Barium Hydroxide): This is a strong base.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial moles of acids and bases:**\nWe use the formula: Moles = Molarity (M) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen ions from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: `HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻`.\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of Hydroxide ions from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates completely and produces two hydroxide ions per formula unit: `Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻`.\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n**3. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with the acids. It will first neutralize the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) completely, as this reaction goes to completion.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid vs. Strong Base**\n    *   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   The strong acid (H⁺) is the limiting reactant. It will be entirely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after reacting with HCl = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid vs. Remaining Strong Base**\n    *   Now, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The weak acid (CH₃COOH) is the limiting reactant in this step.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**4.

The contribution from the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) is negligible in comparison.\n\n**5. Calculate the final pH:**\nFirst, we need to find the total volume of the solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\nNext, calculate the final concentration of the excess hydroxide ions.\n*   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n*   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\nNow, calculate the pOH.\n*   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n*   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\nFinally, calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14.\n*   pH = 14 - pOH\n*   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe calculation was confirmed by the python code execution, which yielded a result of 12.62.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 8.68\nB) 12.62\nC) 8.92\nD) 1.38 (This is the pOH, not the pH)\n\nThe calculated pH is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
