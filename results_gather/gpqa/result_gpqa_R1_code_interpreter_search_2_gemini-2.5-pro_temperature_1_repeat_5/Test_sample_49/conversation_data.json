    "This problem requires interpreting a \"size estimate\" for a Feynman diagram calculation in quantum field theory. The key is to understand how different parts of the expression relate to the structure of the diagram, particularly the number of loops.\n\nHere is the expression from the note:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nLet's break down the components:\n1.  **Coupling Constants (`alpha`, `g`)**: `alpha` (the fine-structure constant) and `g` are coupling constants that determine the strength of interactions. The powers (`alpha^3`, `g^2`) relate to the number and type of vertices in the diagram. For example, `alpha` is proportional to the square of the electric charge `e` (`alpha ~ e^2`), so `alpha^3` implies a factor of `e^6`. This suggests the diagram involves six vertices of the type governed by `e` and two vertices of the type governed by `g`. This part of the expression tells us about the vertices, not directly the loops.\n\n2.  **Numerical and Kinematic Factors (`sqrt(2)`, `8`, `(Q/M)^2`)**: These factors arise from the specific details of the calculation. `sqrt(2)` and `8` are numerical constants that can come from symmetry factors, group theory factors, or traces over gamma matrices. `(Q/M)^2` is a ratio of energy scales (e.g., momentum transfer `Q` to a particle mass `M`), which typically appears as the argument of logarithms or as a power after the loop integrals are evaluated. These factors are consequences of the calculation, not direct indicators of the loop number itself.\n\n3.  **The Loop Factor (`1/(4pi)^6`)**: This is the crucial term for determining the number of loops. In quantum field theory, calculations involving loops require integrating over the momenta of the virtual particles running in the loops. In dimensional regularization (a common technique), an integral over a `D`-dimensional momentum space is performed for each loop.\n\n    *   For each loop, we have an integral of the form `∫ d^D k / (2π)^D`.\n    *   After performing the angular part of this integration in `D` dimensions and using standard techniques like Feynman parameterization, each loop integral contributes a characteristic geometric factor of `1 / (4π)^(D/2)`.\n    *   The problem states the theory is on **four-dimensional spacetime**, so we set the dimension `D = 4`.\n    *   Substituting `D = 4` into the formula, the factor for a single loop (`L=1`) is `1 / (4π)^(4/2) = 1 / (4π)^2`.\n    *   For a diagram with `L` loops, these factors multiply, resulting in a total factor of `(1 / (4π)^2)^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`.\n\nNow, we can compare this general formula to the factor found in the colleague's note, which is `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\n`1 / (4π)^(2L) = 1 / (4π)^6`\n\nBy equating the exponents, we get:\n`2L = 6`\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
