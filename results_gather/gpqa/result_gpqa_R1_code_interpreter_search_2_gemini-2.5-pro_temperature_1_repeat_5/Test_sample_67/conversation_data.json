    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, so its spin is described by the spin operators `S_x`, `S_y`, and `S_z`.\n*   The magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field is `B_initial = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γ(S_x * 0 + S_y * 0 + S_z * B) = -γB * S_z`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field\". This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin-up, `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down, `|-z>`). The corresponding energies are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`.\n*   To minimize energy, the term `-γB * S_z` must be as negative as possible. Assuming `γ > 0`, we need `S_z` to be maximum, which is `+ħ/2`. So, the initial state is the spin-up state along the z-axis.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Define the Dynamics for t ≥ 0\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `B_new = B * y_hat` (pointing in the +y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γB * S_y`.\n*   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting `H_new` and `|ψ(0)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γB * S_y) * t / ħ) |+z> = exp(i * γB * t * S_y / ħ) |+z>`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\n*   We want to find the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t)`.\n*   `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n*   To calculate this, we need to evaluate how `|ψ(t)>` evolves. A common method is to express the initial state `|+z>` in the basis of the new Hamiltonian's eigenstates (i.e., the eigenstates of `S_y`).\n\n### 4. Change of Basis\n\n*   The eigenstates of `S_y` are `|+y>` and `|-y>`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2` respectively.\n*   In the `S_z` basis (`|+z>`, `|-z>`), these states are:\n    `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n    `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n*   We need to express our initial state `|+z>` in this new basis. By adding the two equations above, we get:\n    `|+y> + |-y> = (2/√2) * |+z> = √2 * |+z>`\n    So, `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n### 5. Time Evolution of the State\n\n*   Now we apply the time evolution operator `exp(i * γB * t * S_y / ħ)` to `|ψ(0)>`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γB * t * S_y / ħ) * [ (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>) ]`\n*   Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `S_y`, the exponential operator acts on them simply:\n    `exp(i * γB * t * S_y / ħ) |+y> = exp(i * γB * t * (+ħ/2) / ħ) |+y> = exp(i * γBt / 2) |+y>`\n    `exp(i * γB * t * S_y / ħ) |-y> = exp(i * γB * t * (-ħ/2) / ħ) |-y> = exp(-i * γBt / 2) |-y>`\n*   Substituting these back, we get the state at time `t`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(iγBt/2) |+y> + exp(-iγBt/2) |-y> ]`\n\n### 6. Calculation of `<S_z>(t)`\n\n*   To find `<S_z>(t)`, we can switch `|ψ(t)>` back to the `S_z` basis.\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + exp(-iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ (exp(iγBt/2) + exp(-iγBt/2)) |+z> + i(exp(iγBt/2) - exp(-iγBt/2)) |-z> ]`\n*   Using Euler's formulas (`cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2` and `sin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i)`):\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ 2cos(γBt/2) |+z> + i(2isin(γBt/2)) |-z> ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2) |+z> - sin(γBt/2) |-z>`\n*   Now we can compute the expectation value `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`:\n    `<S_z>(t) = [ cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z| ] * S_z * [ cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z> ]`\n    Since `S_z|+z> = +ħ/2 |+z>` and `S_z|-z> = -ħ/2 |-z>`, and using the orthogonality of the states (`<+z|+z>=1`, `<+z|-z>=0`, etc.):\n    `<S_z>(t) = cos²(γBt/2) * (+ħ/2) + (-sin(γBt/2)) * (-sin(γBt/2)) * (-ħ/2)`\n    `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [ cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2) ]`\n*   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`:\n    `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n### 7. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n*   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form is `A * cos(Ωt)`, where `A` is the amplitude and `Ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   By comparing the forms, we see that the angular frequency is:\n    `Ω = γB`\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin's expectation value precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the y-axis) at the Larmor frequency, `Ω_L = γB`. The z-component of this precessing vector oscillates at this same frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
