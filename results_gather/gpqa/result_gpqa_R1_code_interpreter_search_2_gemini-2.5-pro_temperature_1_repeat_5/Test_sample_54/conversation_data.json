    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Number of Signals and Integration**\n    *   The spectrum shows four distinct signals, indicating four different types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   The total number of protons is calculated by summing the integrations: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H.\n    *   Let's check the number of protons for the possible compounds:\n        *   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): The formula has 8 hydrogens. This matches the data.\n        *   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): The formula has 10 hydrogens. This does not match the data.\n    *   Based on the total proton count, we can eliminate Cis-butenyl acetate (A) and Trans-butenyl acetate (C). The compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet integrating to 3 protons around 2.0-2.2 ppm is highly characteristic of an acetate methyl group (CH3-C(=O)O-). This group has no adjacent protons, hence it is a singlet. This is consistent with an acetate structure.\n    *   **7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:** These signals are in the chemical shift range for vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond). The fact that there are two of them confirms a -CH=CH- moiety.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a single proton (-CH). This fits the structure of a methyl group attached to a double bond (CH3-CH=).\n\n*   **Step 3: Assemble the Structure and Determine Stereochemistry**\n    *   The fragments identified are an acetate group (CH3COO-), a disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-), and a methyl group (-CH3). Assembling these gives propenyl acetate: CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   The final step is to determine if the double bond is *cis* or *trans*. This is done by looking at the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons.\n    *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet with **J = 16.0 Hz**. This J-value represents the coupling between the two protons on the double bond.\n    *   The typical ranges for vinylic coupling constants are:\n        *   **J_trans ≈ 12-18 Hz**\n        *   **J_cis ≈ 6-12 Hz**\n    *   The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely within the range for a *trans* configuration.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    The compound has 8 protons, indicating it is propenyl acetate. The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons confirms a *trans* stereochemistry. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
