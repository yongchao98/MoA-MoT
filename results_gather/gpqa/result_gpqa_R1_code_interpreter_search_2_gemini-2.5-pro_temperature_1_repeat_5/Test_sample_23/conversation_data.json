    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the nature and formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), as 14.28% is very close to 1/7.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H is (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). For n≥1, this is always greater than 1/7. For example, for n=6, it's 14/86 ≈ 16.3%.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of H is 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This perfectly matches the given 14.28%.\n*   The problem also states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which is consistent with Z being a saturated cycloalkane.\n*   Therefore, hydrocarbon Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only the single substance Z (CnH2n).\n*   Z itself is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We can say Y1 = Z = CnH2n (the cycloalkane).\n*   The other component, Y2, must also produce Z upon hydrogenation. Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. The hydrogenation of an aromatic ring requires severe conditions, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n*   So, Y is an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (Z, formula CnH2n) and an aromatic compound (Y2) with the same number of carbon atoms. For example, if Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then Y2 must be benzene (C6H6).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction from mixture X to mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture X (an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2) is converted to mixture Y (equimolar mixture of Z and Y2) when heated with platinum. This reaction is described as a disproportionation.\n*   A disproportionation reaction involves a species being simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One type of molecule is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form the aromatic compound Y2, while another is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form the cycloalkane Z.\n*   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 for the reactants and products. Let X1 and X2 be the components of mixture X. The overall transformation can be represented as:\n    X1 + X2 → Z + Y2\n*   This is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer.\n\n**Step 4: Use conservation of atoms to find the total number of hydrogen atoms.**\n*   From Step 1, Z has the formula CnH2n.\n*   From Step 2, Y2 is the corresponding aromatic compound. A monocyclic aromatic compound formed from a CnH2n cycloalkane by creating a benzene ring involves the loss of 6 hydrogen atoms (3 molecules of H2). For example, cyclohexane (C6H12) becomes benzene (C6H6); methylcyclohexane (C7H14) becomes toluene (C7H8, which is C7H(14-6)). So, Y2 has the formula CnH(2n-6).\n*   The reaction is: X1 + X2 → CnH2n + CnH(2n-6).\n*   By the law of conservation of mass (and atoms), the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n*   Total H atoms in (X1 + X2) = Total H atoms in (Z + Y2)\n*   Total H atoms = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the value of 'n' and calculate the final answer.**\n*   The problem states that X is made of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, have no conjugated bonds, and their hydrogenation gives only Z. This implies that X1 and X2 are unsaturated cyclic compounds (like cycloalkenes and non-conjugated cycloalkadienes) with the same carbon skeleton of 'n' atoms.\n*   The formula CnH2n for Z is satisfied by any cycloalkane (n≥3). We also know Z is \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   Let's test plausible values for 'n':\n    *   **Case n=6**: Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), a very common solvent. Y2 is benzene (C6H6).\n        *   Total H atoms = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n        *   This corresponds to mixture X being, for example, cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). The sum of their hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18. This scenario is chemically consistent.\n    *   **Case n=7**: Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), also a solvent. Y2 is toluene (C7H8).\n        *   Total H atoms = 4(7) - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22.\n        *   This corresponds to mixture X being a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). The sum of their hydrogens is 12 + 10 = 22. This scenario is also chemically consistent.\n*   We have two possible answers based on the chemistry: 18 (for n=6) and 22 (for n=7). Both of these are present in the options (D and A). In chemistry problems of this type, when multiple scenarios are possible, the simplest and most fundamental example is usually the intended one. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the archetypal example of cycloalkanes and aromaticity. The \"widely used as a solvent\" clue also more strongly points to the very common cyclohexane. Therefore, the n=6 case is the most likely intended answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Assuming n=6, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid and one molecule of the second liquid.\nCalculation for n=6: Total H = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# The problem can be solved through logical deduction based on chemical principles.\n# The key steps are:\n# 1. Identify substance Z based on the mass fraction of hydrogen.\n#    Mass % H = 14.28% = 0.1428 ≈ 1/7.\n#    The formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n#    Mass % H for CnH2n = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n#    So, Z is a cycloalkane, CnH2n.\n\n# 2. Identify the components of mixture Y.\n#    Y is an equimolar mixture of Z (CnH2n) and an aromatic compound (Y2) with the same carbon skeleton.\n#    The aromatic compound corresponding to a cycloalkane CnH2n is CnH(2n-6) (e.g., C6H12 -> C6H6; C7H14 -> C7H8).\n\n# 3. Use conservation of atoms for the reaction X -> Y.\n#    The reaction is X1 + X2 -> Z + Y2.\n#    The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 must equal the sum for Z and Y2.\n#    Total H = H_atoms(Z) + H_atoms(Y2)\n#    Total H = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6.\n\n# 4.

    "Based on the detailed step-by-step reasoning and the confirmation from the code execution, the problem leads to two plausible scenarios: one based on a C6 carbon skeleton and another on a C7 skeleton.\n\n1.  **Chemical Foundation:** The problem describes a set of reactions centered around a hydrocarbon Z with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This identifies Z as a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n2.  **Reaction Analysis:** An equimolar mixture X (two unsaturated liquids, X1 and X2) undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form an equimolar mixture Y. Mixture Y contains the cycloalkane Z (CnH2n) and a corresponding aromatic compound Y2 (CnH2n-6).\n3.  **Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two starting molecules (X1 + X2) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules (Z + Y2).\n    Total H atoms = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6.\n4.  **Identifying 'n':** The clue \"widely used as a solvent\" points towards common cycloalkanes. The two most common examples that fit the reaction scheme are:\n    *   **Case n=6:** Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), a very common solvent. The corresponding aromatic Y2 is benzene (C6H6).\n        Total H atoms = 4(6) - 6 = 18. This matches option D.\n    *   **Case n=7:** Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), also a solvent. The corresponding aromatic Y2 is toluene (C7H8).\n        Total H atoms = 4(7) - 6 = 22. This matches option A.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Both scenarios are chemically possible. However, in such problems, the simplest and most fundamental chemical system is usually the intended answer. The cyclohexane/benzene (C6) system is the archetypal example of cycloalkanes and aromatic compounds and their interconversion. Therefore, it is the most probable intended answer.\n\nFor n=6, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
