    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** NaOEt, EtOH (Sodium ethoxide in ethanol)\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The α-hydrogens are acidic due to the two electron-withdrawing ester groups. The base, NaOEt, deprotonates the α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site for Michael addition.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. This pushes the π-electrons of the C=C bond to form another enolate intermediate, which is stabilized by resonance with the ester carbonyl group.\n    *   `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃` ↔ `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH=C(O⁻)OCH₃`\n    *   This enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Product (A) Structure:**\n    *   The final product is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This can also be written as `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n4.  **Naming the Product:**\n    *   Let's analyze the name given in the options: `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    *   This name implies a propane chain (`C-C-C`). Let's number it `C3-C2-C1`.\n    *   The name indicates three trimethyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) groups, two on C1 and one on C3. Let's draw this backbone: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH(1) - CH₂(2) - CH₂(3)(COOCH₃)`.\n    *   The name also indicates a `2-(p-tolyl)` substituent, meaning a p-tolyl group is attached to C2.\n    *   Replacing a hydrogen on C2 with a p-tolyl group gives: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n    *   This structure exactly matches the product derived from the Michael addition mechanism.\n    *   The alternative, `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate`, would be a different regioisomer resulting from an incorrect attack at the α-carbon.\n    *   Therefore, **Product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.**\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** MeOH (solvent), H₃O⁺ (workup)\n*   **Reaction Type:** Stork Enamine Alkylation (via Michael Addition)\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral but highly nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the α-carbon of the original ketone).\n    *   **Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor. The β-carbon (`CH₃-**C**H=CH-CN`) is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Michael Addition):** The enamine's β-carbon attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an iminium ion on the cyclohexane part and a stabilized anion on the nitrile part.\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) has two functions: it protonates the intermediate anion and, crucially, it hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Product (B) Structure:**\n    *   The reaction starts with an enamine of cyclohexanone, so the product will be a substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   The substituent is added to the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone.\n    *   The substituent is derived from but-2-enenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group attached at the C2 position (α to the carbonyl).\n\n4.  **Naming the Product:**\n    *   The molecule can be named with butanenitrile as the parent chain.\n    *   The chain is `N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H-C(4)H₃`.\n    *   At position 3, there is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` substituent.\n    *   So, the name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n    *   The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol form, which is not the major stable product after acidic hydrolysis.\n    *   Therefore, **Product B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.**\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reaction:** C + but-3-en-2-one → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition (Retrosynthesis)\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Reagents:**\n    *   **Product:** `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This is a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring substituted at the C2 position with a `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH₂CH₂COCH₃`).\n    *   **Acceptor:** `but-3-en-2-one` (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COCH₃`.\n    *   **Reaction:** The formation of the product involves creating a bond between the Michael donor (C) and the β-carbon of MVK.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   To find the starting material C, we must \"break\" the bond formed during the Michael addition.\n    *   The bond is between the C2 of the dione ring and the side chain.\n    *   The side chain `–CH₂CH₂COCH₃` comes from MVK (`CH₂=CHCOCH₃`) after the reaction. The bond is formed at the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   This means the nucleophile must have been the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring, with the nucleophilic attack originating from the C2 position.\n    *   The C2 methylene group of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is flanked by two carbonyl groups, making its protons highly acidic (pKa ≈ 5). The base (KOH) easily removes a proton to form a stable, nucleophilic enolate.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   The Michael donor (reactant C) must be `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The other options suggest the enol form (`2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`), which is an incorrect representation of the reactant. While it exists in equilibrium, the standard representation is the keto form.\n    *   Therefore, **Reactant C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.**\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
