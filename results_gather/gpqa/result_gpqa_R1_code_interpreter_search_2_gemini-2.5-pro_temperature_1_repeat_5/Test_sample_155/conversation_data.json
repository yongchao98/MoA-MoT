    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the HPLC analysis.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n          H   C3H7\n         / \\ /\n        C = C\n       /   \\\n    H7C3    H\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom to the double bond is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen adds to one face of the double bond.\n    *   When a *trans*-alkene undergoes epoxidation, it produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on the protonated epoxide. This attack occurs from the side opposite the C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of each enantiomer of the epoxide:\n        *   Starting with (4R,5R)-epoxide, the *anti*-attack by water will lead to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Starting with (4S,5S)-epoxide, the *anti*-attack by water will also lead to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry between carbons 4 and 5, making it a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product: meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        C3H7  C3H7\n         \\   /\n          C = C\n         /   \\\n        H     H\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene results in a single, achiral *meso*-epoxide.\n    *   The product is meso-(4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   Starting with the meso-epoxide, the attack by water can occur at either carbon of the epoxide ring (C4 or C5). These two carbons are enantiotopic.\n    *   Attack at C4 inverts the configuration at C4 (R → S), leaving C5 unchanged (S), resulting in (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 inverts the configuration at C5 (S → R), leaving C4 unchanged (R), resulting in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces an equal mixture of the two enantiomers. This is a **racemic mixture**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso compound (4R,5S) is a **diastereomer** of both (4R,5R) and (4S,5S).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute at the same time, producing a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**. They will elute at different times, producing separate peaks.\n    *   In our mixture, the enantiomeric pair [(4R,5R) + (4S,5S)] will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound (4R,5S), being a diastereomer of the pair, will elute at a different time as a second peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   A chiral column can distinguish between enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities.\n    *   It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   Peak 1: (4R,5S)-diol (meso)\n    *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-diol (enantiomer A)\n    *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-diol (enantiomer B)\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts **2 peaks in standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in chiral HPLC**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
