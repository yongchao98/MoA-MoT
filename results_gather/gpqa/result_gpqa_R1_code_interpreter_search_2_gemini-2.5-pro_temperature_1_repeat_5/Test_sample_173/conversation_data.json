    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of rest mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`. Its total energy is `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`. They are moving with kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n**2. Determine the Masses and Energy Released**\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   `m1 = 2 * m2` (one fragment is twice as massive as the other). We will designate `m1` as the more massive fragment.\n*   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M` (the sum of the fragment rest masses).\n\nWe can solve for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`:\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M` => `3*m2 = 0.99 * M` => `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n*   Then, `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`.\n\nNow, we can find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy `Q` released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy (the \"mass defect\"):\n*   `Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = Mc^2 - (m1+m2)c^2`\n*   `Q = Mc^2 - (0.99*M)c^2 = 0.01 * Mc^2`\n*   `Q = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nIn classical mechanics, we use the following principles:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `p_initial = p_final`. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, `0 = p1 + p2`, which means the fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum: `|p1| = |p2|`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n\nFrom `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `p1^2 = p2^2`. Therefore:\n*   `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n*   This gives us `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, calculated with the classical approximation, is **1000 MeV**.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (The Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, we use:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `|p1| = |p2|`, same as before.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy is `E = T + mc^2`.\n*   We can rearrange this to find the momentum: `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`.\n\nFrom `p1^2 = p2^2`, we have `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`:\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`\n\nWe have two unknowns, `T1` and `T2`, and two equations:\n1.  `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`\n2.  `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV` => `T2 = 3 - T1`\n\nNow substitute the values (`m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`) and the expression for `T2` into the first equation:\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n\nNow, solve for `T1`:\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **1005 MeV**.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the value from the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
