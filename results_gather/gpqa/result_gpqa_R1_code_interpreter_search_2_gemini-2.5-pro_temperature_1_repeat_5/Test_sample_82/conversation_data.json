    "*   **Initial state:** We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Dilution:** We add 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   The initial moles of acetic acid are `M1 * V1 = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 mol`.\n    *   The new volume is `V2 = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L`.\n    *   The new concentration of acetic acid is `M2 = moles / V2 = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M`. This is the solution we are titrating.\n\n### **Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted. The solution contains a significant amount of both the weak acid and its conjugate base, forming a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:\n`pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])`\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of moles of A⁻ to HA is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3. Since they are in the same volume, the concentration ratio is the same.\n    *   `[A⁻]/[HA] = 1/3`\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   `pH = pKa + log(1/3)`\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\n\n# Part 1: pH at 25% titration\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# Calculate pH using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation\n# ratio = [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n\n# Part 2: pH at the equivalence point\n# Initial moles of acetic acid\nconc_acid = 0.025  # M\nvol_acid = 0.040   # L (40 cm3)\nmoles_acid = conc_acid * vol_acid\n\n# Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point\nconc_NaOH = 0.1   # M\nvol_NaOH = moles_acid / conc_NaOH\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_volume = vol_acid + vol_NaOH\n\n# Concentration of acetate (A-) at equivalence point\n# Moles of A- equals initial moles of acid\nconc_A_minus = moles_acid / total_volume\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKw = 1.0e-14\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis of acetate\n# A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-] = x^2 / (conc_A_minus - x)\n# Approximate: Kb = x^2 / conc_A_minus\n# x = [OH-]\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.0 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n> pKa: 4.732867803732489\n> pH at 25% titration: 4.255627255146036\n> pH at 25% titration: 4.26\n> pH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\n### **Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The solution contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), and water. The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n\n`CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)`\n\n1.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH added:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   `moles = 0.001 mol`\n    *   `Volume of NaOH = moles / concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate:**\n    *   `Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L`.\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    *   `Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Kb for acetate:**\n    *   `Ka * Kb = Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴`\n    *   `Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the [OH⁻] concentration:**\n    *   We use the hydrolysis reaction and an ICE table. The equilibrium expression for Kb is:\n        `Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]`\n    *   Let `x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH]`.\n    *   `5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)`.\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate `(0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02`.\n    *   `x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹`\n    *   `x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) = 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M`.\n\n5.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   `pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) = 5.48`.\n    *   `pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52`.\n\nBased on the calculations:\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n*   pH at the equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "**Detailed Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state and the dilution step.**\n    *   We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   First, we calculate the initial moles of acetic acid:\n        *   Volume `V1 = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L`\n        *   Concentration `M1 = 0.05 M`\n        *   Moles of CH₃COOH = `M1 * V1 = 0.05 mol/L * 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol`.\n    *   This solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   The new total volume is `V2 = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L`.\n    *   The concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is `M2 = Moles / V2 = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n    *   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH titrant to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻Na⁺). Consequently, 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n    *   The reaction is: `CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O`.\n    *   At this point, the solution contains both a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). This is a buffer solution.\n    *   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: `pH = pKa + log([Conjugate Base]/[Weak Acid])`\n    *   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n        *   `Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵`\n        *   `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733`\n    *   Next, determine the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the weak acid:\n        *   `[Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid] = [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH]`\n        *   Since 25% has reacted, the amount of base formed is proportional to 25.\n        *   Since 75% remains, the amount of acid left is proportional to 75.\n        *   The ratio is `25 / 75 = 1/3`.\n    *   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        *   `pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - log(3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256`\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the moles of acetic acid have been exactly neutralized by the moles of NaOH.\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol (from step 1).\n    *   Moles of NaOH added = 0.001 mol.\n    *   The solution now contains 0.001 mol of the product, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which dissociates completely into Na⁺ and CH₃COO⁻.\n    *   The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is the conjugate base of a weak acid and will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic:\n        `CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)`\n    *   To find the pH, we first need to find the concentration of the acetate ion.\n        *   Volume of NaOH added to reach equivalence: `Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³`.\n        *   Total volume of the solution at the equivalence point: `40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L`.\n        *   Concentration of acetate `[CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M`.\n    *   Now, we use the hydrolysis reaction to find `[OH⁻]`. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n        *   `Kw = Ka * Kb`, where `Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴` at 25 °C.\n        *   `Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰`.\n    *   Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis, where `x = [OH⁻]`:\n        `Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)`\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate `(0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02`.\n        `5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02`\n        `x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹`\n        `x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M`.\n    *   Calculate pOH:\n        `pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483`\n    *   Calculate pH:\n        `pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517`\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The pH at 25% titration is 4.26.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
