    "An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. To solve this problem, we need to determine the angular distribution and wavelength dependence of the radiated power. The most fundamental and common type of radiation from a compact oscillating source is electric dipole radiation. We will model the oscillating spheroid as an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1.  **Modeling the Radiation Source:**\n    The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" with a spheroid shape, symmetric about the z-axis. The simplest and most general model for such a source is an oscillating electric dipole, with the dipole moment **p** oscillating along the axis of symmetry, the z-axis. Let the dipole moment be **p**(t) = p₀cos(ωt) **ẑ**, where p₀ is the amplitude and ω is the angular frequency of oscillation. This is the lowest-order term in a multipole expansion, and it is the dominant source of radiation unless it is zero due to some specific symmetry, which is not stated in the problem.\n\n2.  **Angular Distribution of Radiated Power:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole oriented along the z-axis is given by:\n    ```\n    dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)\n    ```\n    where θ is the angle with respect to the z-axis, and K is a constant that depends on the frequency and the dipole moment amplitude.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    *   The radiated power is a function of the angle θ. We need to find its maximum value. The function sin²(θ) has a maximum value of 1, which occurs when θ = 90° (i.e., in the equatorial plane).\n    *   The maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, A, is therefore:\n        ```\n        A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * sin²(90°) = K * 1 = K\n        ```\n    *   Now, we need to find the power radiated at an angle θ = 30°.\n        ```\n        (dP/dΩ) at 30° = K * sin²(30°)\n        ```\n    *   We know that sin(30°) = 1/2. Therefore, sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4.\n    *   So, the power at 30° is:\n        ```\n        (dP/dΩ) at 30° = K * (1/4) = A / 4\n        ```\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power A that is radiated at θ = 30° is (A/4) / A = **1/4**.\n\n4.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    *   The function `f` represents the radiated power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`. We need to find its dependence on the wavelength λ.\n    *   The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the square of the second time derivative of the dipole moment. This leads to a dependence on the fourth power of the angular frequency, ω.\n        ```\n        dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴\n        ```\n    *   The angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by the formula:\n        ```\n        ω = 2π * (frequency) = 2π * (c/λ)\n        ```\n        where c is the speed of light.\n    *   From this, we see that ω is inversely proportional to λ (ω ∝ 1/λ).\n    *   Substituting this into the power relation, we get:\n        ```\n        dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n        ```\n    *   Therefore, a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**. This dependence is also famously associated with Rayleigh scattering, which is physically the same process of radiation from induced dipoles.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the two parts of our analysis:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThese results correspond to option A.\n\nThe alternative possibility of electric quadrupole radiation (which would lead to option B) is less likely because it requires the electric dipole moment to be zero, a special condition not implied by the problem statement. The electric dipole model represents the most general and fundamental case.\n\n<<<A>>>"
