    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:** The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (since it's in a p orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a p orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the total magnetic quantum number, which corresponds to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement and the desired outcome:** A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of getting the following specific outcomes simultaneously:\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number of the first electron being $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number of the second electron being $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    The state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$, often shortened to $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of angular momentum addition:** In quantum mechanics, when combining angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is simply the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed as the selection rule for the magnetic quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n4.  **Check for conservation of the magnetic quantum number:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome $|-1, -1>$, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Compare the values:** The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) is not equal to the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the desired final state ($m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$).\n\n6.  **Determine the probability:** The initial state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$. This is the Clebsch-Gordan expansion:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} <m_{l1}, m_{l2} | l, m> |m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$\n    The coefficient $<m_{l1}, m_{l2} | l, m>$ is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental property of these coefficients is that they are zero unless $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\n    The probability of measuring the state $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$ is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the initial state onto the final state:\n    $P(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = |<m_{l1}, m_{l2} | l, m>|^2$\n\n    In our case, we want the probability of measuring the state $|-1, -1>$.\n    $P(-1, -1) = |<-1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n\n    Since $m = -1$ and $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$, the condition $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is not met. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<-1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is zero.\n    This means that the state $|-1, -1>$ has no contribution to the expansion of the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The probability of measuring an outcome that violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum is zero.\n    $P(-1, -1) = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
