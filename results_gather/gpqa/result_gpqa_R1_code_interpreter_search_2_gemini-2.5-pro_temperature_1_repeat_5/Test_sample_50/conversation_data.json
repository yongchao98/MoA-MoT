    "This problem can be solved using the method of images, a technique in electrostatics that simplifies problems involving charges and conductors.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V = 0).\n    *   When the charge `q` is brought near the sphere, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. These induced charges redistribute themselves in such a way that the total electric potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    *   The complex electric field produced by the point charge `q` and the induced surface charge on the sphere can be simplified. We can replace the sphere and its induced surface charge with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed inside the sphere.\n    *   The position and magnitude of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface (at radius R) is zero, satisfying the boundary condition.\n    *   Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at `z = d`. The image charge `q'` is placed at `z = d'`.\n    *   For the potential to be zero on the surface of the sphere, the image charge must have:\n        *   Magnitude: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n        *   Position: `d' = R^2 / d`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    *   The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n    *   A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The image charge is a mathematical tool, not a real charge. The actual energy is stored in the electric field of the real charge `q` and the *induced surface charge* on the sphere.\n    *   The correct way to calculate the work done (and thus the potential energy `U`) is to use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created *only by the induced charges on the sphere*. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge itself builds up as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity.\n    *   The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) is `d - d'`.\n    *   So, `V_induced` at position `d` is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n        where `k = 1 / (4πε₀)`.\n\n4.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Now, use the formula for potential energy `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   Simplify to get the final expression for the net potential energy:\n        `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The derived expression `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option A.\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive. Work is done *by* the electric field as the charge is brought from infinity, so the potential energy of the final configuration is negative relative to the zero potential energy at infinite separation."
