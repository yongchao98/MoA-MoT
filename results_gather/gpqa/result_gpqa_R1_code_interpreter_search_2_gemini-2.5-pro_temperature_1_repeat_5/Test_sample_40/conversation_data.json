    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We need to use the framework of special relativity to solve this problem. We have two inertial frames of reference:\n    *   **The Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference, which is considered stationary.\n    *   **The Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference in which the glass is at rest. This frame is moving with a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Determine the Velocities in Each Frame:**\n    *   **Velocity of the glass relative to the lab:** The problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity `v` in the same direction as the light beam. So, the velocity of frame S' relative to S is `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the glass's rest frame (S'):** The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `u' = c/n`, where `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum. In this frame, the glass is stationary. The problem specifies that we should take `c=1`. Therefore, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula:** We want to find the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). Let's call this speed `u`. We need to \"add\" the velocity of the light in the glass (`u'`) to the velocity of the glass itself (`v`). The classical way would be to simply add them (`u = u' + v`), but this is incorrect at relativistic speeds. We must use Einstein's velocity-addition formula:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:** Now, we substitute the values we have into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n*(1/n) + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*(v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This matches option D.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as the Fizeau effect, and its correct theoretical explanation was an early triumph of the theory of special relativity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
