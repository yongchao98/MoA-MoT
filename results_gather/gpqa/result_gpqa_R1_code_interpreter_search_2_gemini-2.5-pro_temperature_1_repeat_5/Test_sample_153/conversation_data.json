    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. Its intensity is 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's verify the molecular formula C7H5ClO2 (which is the formula for all the options).\n    *   Nominal Mass = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   M+2 Mass = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 37) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158.\n    The mass spectrometry data is consistent with the molecular formula C7H5ClO2.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic absorption for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl of an aromatic carboxylic acid (conjugated system).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is a singlet, integrating to one proton, and appears far downfield. This chemical shift is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**O**H).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Integration:** Each signal represents two protons (2H), for a total of four aromatic protons. This indicates a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** Both signals are doublets (d). A doublet means each set of protons is being split by only one neighboring proton. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR and the -COOH proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde and a phenol. It would not show the characteristic broad IR peak of a carboxylic acid, nor the -COOH proton at 11.0 ppm. Its aromatic ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex, showing signals for three protons with different splitting.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR and the MS data. However, it is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) benzene ring. The four aromatic protons would be non-equivalent and would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR, not two simple doublets of 2H each.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS:** Has the formula C7H5ClO2 (MW = 156 for ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine. (✓ Correct)\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which matches the broad O-H and the C=O peaks. (✓ Correct)\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It has a carboxylic acid proton (~11.0 ppm). It is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring, which gives the characteristic pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each for two protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm). (✓ Correct)\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nAll spectral data are perfectly consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
