    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the concept of density in planets:** A planet's density is its mass divided by its volume (ρ = M/V). For planets with the same basic composition (e.g., a mix of rock and iron like Earth), the density is not constant across different masses. This is due to **gravitational compression**. A more massive planet has stronger gravity, which compresses its internal materials, making them denser. Therefore, for planets of the same composition, a more massive planet will have a higher average density.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option based on this principle:**\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline reference, which is essentially Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's use this as ρ_Earth. So, ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to Earth's density. So, ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet has the same building blocks as Earth but significantly more mass (M_c = 5 * M_Earth). Due to the principle of gravitational compression, its own immense gravity will squeeze its material much more tightly than Earth's gravity does. This will result in a significantly higher average density. Thus, ρ_c > ρ_Earth. To illustrate, a 5 Earth-mass planet with Earth-like composition is predicted to have a density of around 7-8 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet has the same composition but less mass (M_d = 0.5 * M_Earth). The gravitational compression will be weaker than Earth's. As a result, its material will be less compressed, and its average density will be lower than Earth's. Thus, ρ_d < ρ_Earth. For instance, its density would likely be around 4.5-5.0 g/cm³.\n\n3.  **Compare the densities:**\n\n    *   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_c > 5.51 g/cm³ (and is significantly higher)\n    *   ρ_d < 5.51 g/cm³\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the expected densities, the planet described in option (c) is the most massive one with an Earth-like composition, and therefore will be the most compressed and have the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
