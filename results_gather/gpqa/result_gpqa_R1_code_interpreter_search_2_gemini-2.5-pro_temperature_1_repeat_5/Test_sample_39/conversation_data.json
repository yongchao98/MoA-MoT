    "*   **Analysis of the Context:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab. A primary activity in such a lab is the synthesis of a target molecule. After a reaction is run, the resulting mixture typically contains the desired product, unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and catalysts. A crucial and often difficult step is the purification of the desired product from this mixture.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Phrase:** The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common piece of laboratory slang. It's a metaphorical way of saying that the compounds cannot be separated from one another using a particular technique.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Purification Techniques and Options:**\n    *   The most common purification technique for small to medium-scale synthetic organic chemistry is **chromatography**, particularly Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) for analysis and column chromatography for preparative separation.\n    *   Chromatography separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (e.g., silica gel, which is very polar) and a mobile phase (a solvent or solvent mixture).\n    *   A compound's behavior in this system is primarily determined by its **polarity**. Polar compounds adhere more strongly to the polar stationary phase and move more slowly, while less polar compounds are carried along more quickly by the mobile phase.\n    *   On a TLC plate, separated compounds appear as distinct spots at different heights (different Retention factor, or Rf, values). If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at the same rate and their spots will appear at the same height, literally \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   Similarly, during column chromatography, compounds with similar polarities will exit (elute from) the column at the same time, making them impossible to collect in separate fractions. This is also described as the compounds \"coming out on top of each other.\"\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options based on this understanding:**\n    *   **A) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property used to characterize a chiral compound *after* it has been purified. It is not a basis for the most common separation techniques. Therefore, this is an unlikely meaning.\n    *   **B) Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions:** While these interactions are the fundamental basis for how chromatography works (i.e., how compounds interact with the stationary phase), the core property that governs the *strength* of these interactions in this context is polarity. Stating the compounds have similar polarities is a more direct and common way to describe the problem.\n    *   **C) Similar polarities:** This is the most direct and common reason for a failed separation by chromatography. If the compounds have similar polarities, they will behave identically during the chromatographic process, leading to the situation described. This is the most likely meaning of the chemist's complaint.\n    *   **D) Similar boiling points:** This would be a problem for purification by **distillation**. While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of spots on a TLC plate than of two liquids co-distilling. Chromatography is a more universally used purification technique in modern synthetic labs than distillation, making a chromatography problem the more probable scenario.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" is classic organic chemistry slang for compounds that fail to separate during chromatography. The physical property that governs separation by chromatography is polarity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
