    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the energies for the system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Identical fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `ms` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because there are two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, a maximum of two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down) can occupy that energy level.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L are given by the formula:\nE_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)\nwhere `n` is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2).\nTherefore, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\n*   E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n*   E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n*   E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n*   E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n*   and so on.\n\n**3. Calculating the Total Energies**\n\nTo find the total energy of the four-particle system, we sum the energies of the individual particles. We will determine the particle configurations for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n**Ground State Energy (E_g)**\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n=1 level (Energy 1E):** We can place two particles here.\n*   **n=2 level (Energy 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here.\n\nThe ground state configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2}.\nThe total ground state energy is:\nE_g = (2 × E_1) + (2 × E_2)\nE_g = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E)\nE_g = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n\n*   Ground state configuration: {n=1: 2 particles}, {n=2: 2 particles}.\n*   Highest occupied level is n=2.\n*   Lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We excite one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   The first excited state configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_1st = (2 × E_1) + (1 × E_2) + (1 × E_3)\nE_1st = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)\nE_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider different possibilities for excitation from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\n*   **Possibility 1 (already found):** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E (This is the 1st excited state).\n*   **Possibility 2:** Excite one particle from the lower n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: {1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E_1) + (2 × E_2) + (1 × E_3) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3}.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E_1) + (2 × E_3) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n*   **Possibility 4:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4}.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E_1) + (1 × E_2) + (1 × E_4) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
