    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:** The key observation is two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this indicates the proton exists in two different chemical environments. The fact that the peaks have roughly equal integrals suggests that these two environments are populated in a nearly 1:1 ratio. The total integral of 1H confirms we are looking at a single proton split into two populations.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The LC (Liquid Chromatography) experiment separates compounds based on their physical properties (like polarity). The observation of two separate peaks confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species that can be physically separated. The MS (Mass Spectrometry) data shows that both of these species have the same mass, which is consistent with the expected product. This means the two species are isomers of each other. The elevated temperature in the LC run is a crucial detail; it suggests that the two species are stable and do not easily interconvert, as a high energy barrier exists between them. If they were rapidly interconverting conformers (rotamers), the peaks would likely merge at a higher temperature.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is unlikely because the two peaks in the LC-MS have the *same mass*. A precursor would typically have a different molecular weight.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** \"Double coupling\" is a synthetic procedure to ensure a reaction goes to completion. It does not generate a stable isomeric side product. This option is not a chemically sound explanation for the observed data.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and spectroscopic properties. Therefore, they would not produce separate peaks in a standard 1H NMR or a standard LC experiment. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has two or more chiral centers, and the configuration differs at one or more, but not all, of these centers.\n        *   **Consistency with Data:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and are not chemically equivalent. Therefore, they can be separated by standard LC (explaining the two LC peaks) and will give distinct signals in an NMR spectrum (explaining the two alpha-proton peaks). As they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass (explaining the MS data).\n        *   **Plausibility in Context:** In peptide synthesis, it is a common side reaction for the alpha-carbon of an amino acid to lose its stereochemical integrity (racemize or epimerize) during the harsh conditions of some coupling reactions. If the peptide has at least one other stable chiral center, this epimerization will create a diastereomer. For example, coupling L-Alanine to L-Phenylalanine could result in a mixture of L-Ala-L-Phe and L-Ala-D-Phe if the phenylalanine epimerized. These two molecules are diastereomers and would exhibit exactly the properties described in the question.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a mixture of diastereomers is the only explanation that fits all the experimental observations (two peaks in NMR, two separable peaks in LC, and identical mass for both species).\n\n<<<D>>>"
