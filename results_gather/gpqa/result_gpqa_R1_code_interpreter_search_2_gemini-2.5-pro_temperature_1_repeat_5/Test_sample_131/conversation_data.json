    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds in the mixture have the formula C10H14.\n    *   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound produces exactly one aromatic singlet.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, with a combined integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n2.  **Verify the Molecular Formula of the Candidate Compounds:**\n    *   The general formula for a tetramethylbenzene is C6H2(CH3)4, which simplifies to C10H14. All three tetramethylbenzene options (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-) fit this formula.\n    *   The formula for 1,4-diethylbenzene is C6H4(C2H5)2, which simplifies to C10H14. This option also fits the formula.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Candidate:**\n    We need to analyze the chemical equivalence of protons in each molecule due to symmetry.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aliphatic singlet** (integrating to 12H).\n        *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet, 1 aliphatic singlet.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1 and C4) and (C2 and C3). This will result in **two aliphatic singlets** (each integrating to 6H).\n        *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet, 2 aliphatic singlets.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   This molecule is less symmetrical.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two separate aromatic singlets** (each integrating to 1H).\n        *   Since this single compound produces two aromatic singlets, it cannot be part of a mixture that also has two aromatic singlets (as that would result in 3 or 4 total aromatic signals, depending on chemical shift overlap). Therefore, **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene can be eliminated.**\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent and will produce **one aromatic singlet** (integrating to 4H).\n        *   **Ethyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (-CH2-) protons will couple with the methyl (-CH3-) protons, producing a **quartet**. The methyl protons will couple with the methylene protons, producing a **triplet**. The aliphatic region will show a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.**\n\n4.  **Identify the Mixture from the Remaining Candidates:**\n    *   Based on the analysis above, the two compounds in the mixture must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's verify that a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the experimental data.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   The mixture will show **two aromatic singlets** with a 2H:2H or **1:1 integration ratio**. This matches the data.\n\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (from its 12 equivalent methyl protons).\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets (from its two sets of 6 equivalent methyl protons).\n        *   In total, the mixture will have **three aliphatic singlets**. This matches the data.\n        *   The integration values for these three signals will be 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
