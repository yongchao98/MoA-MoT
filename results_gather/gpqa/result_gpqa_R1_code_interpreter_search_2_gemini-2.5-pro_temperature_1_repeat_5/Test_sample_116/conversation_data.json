    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to identify which of the four given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Define Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common structural feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a **chiral center** (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). Another important source of chirality, relevant to one of the options, is **atropisomerism**, which occurs in molecules with hindered rotation around a single bond (like certain substituted biphenyls). A molecule is **achiral** (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Compound:**\n\n    *   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single bond. The key feature is the substitution pattern. All four positions *ortho* to the inter-ring bond (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are occupied by substituents: two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** These substituents are sterically bulky. Their presence prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This restricted rotation is the basis for **atropisomerism**. Because the rotation is locked, the rings are forced into a non-planar, twisted conformation. Let's check for symmetry in this stable conformation. The molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.\n\n    *   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Structure:** This is an ester derived from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to look for chiral centers. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n            *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n            *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n            *   Group 3: -CH₃ (methyl)\n            *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        *   Since this carbon atom is attached to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**. A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound has a chiral center and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **3. benzophenone**\n        *   **Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. It is a ketone with two phenyl rings attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The central carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized, so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the carbon-oxygen double bond. It is possible for the molecule to adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. A molecule with such symmetry is superimposable on its mirror image.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **4. dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry which is the plane of the molecule itself. It also possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. (Note: It does exhibit geometric isomerism, its *cis*-isomer being dimethyl maleate, but the question specifically asks for *optical* isomerism).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound 1 is chiral (atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 is chiral (chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 is achiral.\n    *   Compound 4 is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
