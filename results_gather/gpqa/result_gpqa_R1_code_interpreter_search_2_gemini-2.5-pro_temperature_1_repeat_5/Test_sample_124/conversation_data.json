    "The user is asking for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$, which is the potential for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three directions.\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separation of variables in either Cartesian or spherical coordinates.\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, the total energy is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\nwhere $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nWe can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe energy levels are determined by the value of the principal quantum number $n$.\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to $n=0$.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of distinct sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same energy. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose three non-negative integers that sum to $n$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we have $n=3$. We need to find the number of combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\nThis is a classic problem in combinatorics, and the number of combinations (degeneracy, $g_n$) is given by the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+2)!}{n!2!} = \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}$\n\nFor $n=3$, the degeneracy is:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$\n\nWe can also list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ to verify this:\n*   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) -> 3 states\n*   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) -> 6 states\n*   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1, 1, 1) -> 1 state\n\nTotal number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\nTherefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   Calculated Energy: $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   Calculated Degeneracy: 10\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 3 - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\nB) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, 3 - Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy.\nC) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 10 - Incorrect energy, but correct degeneracy.\nD) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, 10 - Correct energy and correct degeneracy.\n\n<<<D>>>"
