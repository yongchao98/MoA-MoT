    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular feature 1:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a `C6H4` core.\n    *   **Molecular feature 2 (FTIR):** An ester group is present (`-COO-`).\n    *   **Molecular feature 3 (1H NMR):**\n        *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with two different substituents in the para (1,4) positions will give two signals (two doublets) for the four aromatic protons. This is the most likely substitution pattern.\n        *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It limits the possible alkyl groups in the molecule. For the ester group `R-COO-R'`, if R' contains more than one carbon (like an ethyl group, `-CH2CH3`), it would have a `-CH2-` group. Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`). This accounts for one of the two `-CH3` signals.\n        *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** We have identified one `-CH3` group from the methyl ester (`-COOCH3`). The second `-CH3` group must be part of the other substituent.\n        *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) attached to another group.\n            *   Let's denote the group as `R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n            *   The proton H(a) is coupled only to H(b), so it appears as a doublet.\n            *   The proton H(b) is coupled to H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent `-CH3` group (a quartet). This results in a \"doublet of quartets\" signal.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment. This fragment also contains the second `-CH3` group.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (`C6H4`).\n    *   One substituent is a methyl ester group (`-COOCH3`).\n    *   The other substituent is a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   The most likely structure is **Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n    Structure: `CH3-CH=CH - C6H4 - COOCH3`\n\n3.  **Verify the structure against the data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted aromatic ring:** Yes.\n    *   **Ester group:** Yes.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** The structure has no `-CH2-` groups. Correct.\n    *   **1H NMR signals (total 6):**\n        1. Aromatic-H (ortho to ester)\n        2. Aromatic-H (ortho to propenyl)\n        3. Vinyl-H (doublet)\n        4. Vinyl-H (doublet of quartets)\n        5. -CH3 (from ester, singlet)\n        6. -CH3 (from propenyl, doublet)\n    *   The proposed structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data provided.\n\n4.  **Determine the chemical formula:**\n    Now, let's count the atoms in the determined structure: `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3`.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 1 (from CH3) + 1 (from =CH) + 1 (from =CH) + 6 (from C6H4) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from OCH3) = 11 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 3 (from CH3) + 1 (from =CH) + 1 (from =CH) + 4 (from C6H4) + 3 (from OCH3) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\n    The chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Match with the options:**\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 corresponds to option D.\n\nI will use a simple Python script to confirm the atom count.\n```python\n# Define the number of atoms for each fragment of the proposed molecule:\n# Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate\n\n# Fragment 1: propenyl group (CH3-CH=CH-)\npropenyl = {'C': 3, 'H': 5, 'O': 0}\n\n# Fragment 2: benzene ring core (-C6H4-)\nbenzene_ring = {'C': 6, 'H': 4, 'O': 0}\n\n# Fragment 3: methyl ester group (-COOCH3)\nmethyl_ester = {'C': 2, 'H': 3, 'O': 2}\n\n# Sum the atoms from all fragments\ntotal_C = propenyl['C'] + benzene_ring['C'] + methyl_ester['C']\ntotal_H = propenyl['H'] + benzene_ring['H'] + methyl_ester['H']\ntotal_O = propenyl['O'] + benzene_ring['O'] + methyl_ester['O']\n\n# Print the final chemical formula\nprint(f\"The chemical formula is C{total_C}H{total_H}O{total_O}\")\n```\nThe chemical formula is C11H12O2\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically interpreting the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Aromatic Ring and Substituents:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring with two substituents. The core formula for this part is C6H4.\n*   **\"1H NMR spectrum shows...two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring gives two signals for its aromatic protons only when it is para-substituted (1,4-substitution). This is because of the symmetry in the molecule, making the two protons ortho to substituent A equivalent, and the two protons ortho to substituent B equivalent. This confirms the C6H4 core.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Ester Group:**\n\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum...shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group\"**: We have a -COO- functional group.\n*   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a critical piece of information. An ester group has the general structure R-COO-R'. If R' were an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) or any longer alkyl chain, it would contain a -CH2- group, which is ruled out. Therefore, R' must be a methyl group (-CH3). This means we have a methyl ester, `-COOCH3`.\n*   This methyl ester accounts for one of the two `-CH3` signals mentioned in the NMR data. This signal would be a singlet.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Second Substituent:**\n\n*   **\"1H NMR spectrum shows...two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: This specific splitting pattern is a hallmark of a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   Let's label the protons: `R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n    *   The proton H(a) is adjacent only to H(b), so its signal is split into a **doublet**.\n    *   The proton H(b) is adjacent to H(a) (one proton) and the -CH3 group (three protons). It is split into a doublet by H(a) and a quartet by the -CH3 group, resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n*   This propenyl group also contains a methyl group, which accounts for the second of the two `-CH3` signals. This signal would be a doublet, as it's coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton H(b).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Determining the Formula:**\n\nNow we can assemble the complete structure from the fragments we have identified:\n\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`)\n*   A methyl ester group (`-COOCH3`)\n*   A propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)\n\nThe structure is **Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\nLet's count the atoms to find the chemical formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from OCH3) + 3 (from propenyl group) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from OCH3) + 5 (from propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
