    "This problem involves a particle annihilation process, which can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis**\n\n*   The process is the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common approximation in particle physics problems, meaning its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can consider it to be effectively at rest.\n*   The proton is also assumed to be at rest in the laboratory frame.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.\n*   The total initial momentum ($P_{initial}$) is zero, as both particles are at rest.\n\n**2. Final State Analysis**\n\n*   The annihilation produces four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given that the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n*   By the conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum was zero, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. This means their vector momenta must sum to zero ($\\sum \\vec{p}_i = 0$).\n*   The most symmetric and energetically favorable outcome is that the available energy is distributed equally among the four identical particles. Therefore, all four particles ($A_1^+, A_2^+, A_1^-, A_2^-$) will have the same kinetic energy and thus the same speed, $v$.\n*   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the relativistic total energies of the four A particles. The total energy of a single particle is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   So, $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe core of the solution lies in equating the initial and final energies:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n\nTo proceed, we need the rest energy of the proton ($m_p c^2$). This is a standard value in physics.\n$m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV\n\nNow we can set up the conservation equation:\nTotal Rest Energy of Proton and Antiproton = Total Energy of the four A particles\n$m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n$2 \\times (m_p c^2) = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nWe can now substitute the known values and solve for the velocity $v$.\n\n1.  **Solve for the Lorentz factor, Î³:**\n    $2 \\times (938.27 \\text{ MeV}) = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    $1876.54 = 1200 \\times \\gamma$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n2.  **Solve for the velocity, v:**\n    The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We need to rearrange this to solve for $v/c$.\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n    Now, substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\n3.  **Final Velocity:**\n    The velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, a Python script can be used:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.27  # Rest energy of proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300.0   # Rest energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# Total initial energy\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Total final energy is 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# E_initial = E_final  =>  2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# Solve for gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Solve for v/c from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# (v/c)^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2\nv_over_c_squared = 1 - (1 / (gamma**2))\nv_over_c = math.sqrt(v_over_c_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {v_over_c:.2f}c\")\n```\nThe script will output `The velocity of particle A is 0.77c`.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem can be solved by applying the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We assume the proton is also at rest in the lab frame. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.\n\n    *   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n2.  **Final State:** The annihilation results in four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass. We are given the rest energy of particle A, $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV. Due to conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the total energy must be distributed equally among the four final particles, meaning they all will have the same total energy and thus the same velocity, $v$.\n\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n        $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2) = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:** We equate the initial and final energies.\n\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Solve for Velocity (v):** First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.563$\n\n    Next, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for $v$.\n\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    *   $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2.443} \\approx 1 - 0.409$\n    *   $(v/c)^2 \\approx 0.591$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.769$\n\n    Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
