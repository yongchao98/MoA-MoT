    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the product's spectroscopic data**\n\nThe first step is to deduce the structure of the product formed in the reaction. The product has the same molecular formula as the starting material, C11H12O, since the reaction is likely a rearrangement.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C11H12O, DoU = (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*11 + 2 - 12)/2 = 6. This suggests a benzene ring (DoU=4) and two additional double bonds or rings.\n\n*   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 ppm (1C):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically a ketone or aldehyde. Given it's conjugated, a ketone is very likely. This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **δ 126.9 - 144.1 ppm:** There are 6 signals in this region, corresponding to 8 carbons (one signal for 2C, another for 2C). This is the aromatic/alkene (sp2 carbons) region. A benzene ring uses 6 carbons. The remaining two sp2 carbons must belong to a C=C double bond. This accounts for a benzene ring (DoU=4) and a C=C double bond (DoU=1).\n    *   Total DoU accounted for: 1 (C=O) + 4 (benzene) + 1 (C=C) = 6. This matches the calculated DoU.\n    *   **δ 21.3 ppm and δ 28.4 ppm:** These are in the alkyl region (sp3 carbons) and correspond to two methyl (CH3) groups.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and δ 7.08 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 7.68 (1H, d) and δ 6.75 (1H, d):** These are two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton. They are in the vinyl proton region and are coupled to each other, indicating a `-CH=CH-` group. The large difference in chemical shift suggests they are part of a conjugated system.\n    *   **δ 2.31 (3H, s) and δ 2.28 (3H, s):** These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons, indicating two methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  We have a `-CH=CH-` group.\n    3.  We have a ketone group (`C=O`).\n    4.  We have two methyl groups (`-CH3`).\n    5.  Let's assemble these pieces. One methyl group must be one of the substituents on the para-disubstituted ring, forming a p-tolyl group (`CH3-C6H4-`). The other methyl group must be the acetyl methyl (`-C(=O)-CH3`).\n    6.  Connecting all the fragments `p-tolyl`, `-CH=CH-`, and `acetyl` gives the structure: **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one** (also known as (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one).\n\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`\n    *   This structure is fully consistent with all NMR data. The p-tolyl group and the conjugated enone system explain all the signals and their chemical shifts.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and deduce the reactant (Compound X)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (C11H12O) is treated with DABCO (a non-nucleophilic base) at high temperature (403 K = 130 °C). This results in a rearrangement to form (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Reactant Options:** The options provided for Compound X are all epoxides. The reaction is a base-catalyzed rearrangement of an epoxide.\n*   **Connecting Reactant to Product:** We need to find which of the epoxide options can rearrange to form `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`. The key is that the carbon skeleton must match. The product has a p-tolyl group (`CH3-C6H4-`).\n\n    *   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** Contains a styryl group (`C6H5-CH=CH-`), which has an unsubstituted phenyl ring. This cannot form a product with a p-tolyl group. **Incorrect.**\n    *   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** Contains a 4-methylstyryl group (`CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-`). This has the correct p-tolyl moiety. Its structure is `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. This is a vinylic epoxide. Let's check the mechanism.\n    *   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. **Incorrect.**\n    *   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula (C10H10O) does not match the given formula (C11H12O). **Incorrect.**\n\n**Step 3: Verify the mechanism for Option B**\n\nThe only plausible candidate is **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**. Let's confirm the reaction mechanism.\n\n1.  The starting material is `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`.\n2.  The base, DABCO, abstracts the most acidic proton. In this vinylic epoxide, the proton on the carbon of the epoxide ring that is also adjacent to the double bond (`-CH=CH-CH(O)-`) is activated and thus acidic.\n3.  Deprotonation gives a carbanion: `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(-)(O)CH2`.\n4.  The strained epoxide ring opens, leading to the formation of an oxygen anion (an enolate): `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=CH2)-O-`.\n5.  This enolate tautomerizes to the more stable ketone form upon protonation, yielding the final product: `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`.\n\nThis mechanism is well-established for the base-catalyzed isomerization of vinyloxiranes and correctly predicts the formation of the product we identified from the NMR spectra.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCompound X is **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
