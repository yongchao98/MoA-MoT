    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The \"stationary\" frame of reference is the Galaxy (let's call it frame S).\n    *   The \"moving\" frame of reference is the supernova ejecta (let's call it frame S').\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n    *   We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's frame of reference (frame S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for the moving object (the ejecta). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy frame is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   We first need to find `Δt` corresponding to the `Δt' = 50 s` that passed in the ejecta's frame.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time Dilation:**\n    *   The time dilation formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, where `c` is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculations:**\n\n    *   **Step 5a: Calculate the ratio β = v/c.**\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 5b: Calculate the Lorentz factor γ.**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 5c: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame, Δt.**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step 5d: Calculate the distance d traveled in the Galaxy frame.**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n    *   Now, we compute the final numerical value. I will use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # proper time in seconds\nc = 300000  # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n<execute_result>\n3061862.178488331\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to option A. The small difference is due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S) is the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   The ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S') is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the *proper time* because it's measured by a clock at rest relative to the event being measured (the aging of the ejecta).\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame (frame S).\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    From the perspective of an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S), time for the moving ejecta (S') appears to pass more slowly. We need to calculate how much time, `Δt`, has passed in the Galaxy's frame while 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.\n\n    The time dilation formula is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    and `c` is the speed of light, approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n    *   `Δt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    The distance traveled is the velocity (as measured in the Galaxy's frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (as measured in the Galaxy's frame).\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`. This value is extremely close to option A.\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the non-relativistic answer: `60,000 km/s * 50 s`)\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe result from our calculation, `3,061,862 km`, rounds to `3,060,000 km` when considering the likely precision of the options provided.\n\n<<<A>>>"
