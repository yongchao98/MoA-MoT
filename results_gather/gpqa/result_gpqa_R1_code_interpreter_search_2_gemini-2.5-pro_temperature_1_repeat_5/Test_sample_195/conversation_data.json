    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the harmonic oscillator is conserved. The total energy $E$ is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE).\n    $E = KE + PE$\n\n2.  **Relativistic Kinetic Energy:** The kinetic energy of a particle of rest mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ is given by the relativistic formula:\n    $KE = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Potential Energy:** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $PE$ stored in the spring when it is displaced by a distance $x$ from its equilibrium position is:\n    $PE = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n4.  **Total Energy Expression:** Combining the kinetic and potential energy, the total energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is:\n    $E = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    Since the total energy is conserved, this value remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n5.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude:** We can calculate the total energy at the point of maximum amplitude, $x = A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    *   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is $KE = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $PE = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of the system is $E = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n6.  **Energy at Maximum Speed:** The maximum speed, $v_{max}$, is achieved when the mass passes through the equilibrium position, $x = 0$. At this point, the potential energy is zero.\n    *   At $x=0$, the potential energy is $PE = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The speed is $v = v_{max}$. The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is at its maximum: $KE = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy at this point is $E = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n7.  **Equating Energies and Solving for $v_{max}$:** By the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at maximum amplitude must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n8.  Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$. First, isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n9.  Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n10. To solve for $v_{max}$, we rearrange the equation. First, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n11. Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n12. Isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n13. Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n14. **Comparing with the options:** This result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
