    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax range and the parallax itself.\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental quantities:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (d). The relationship is given by `plx = 1/d`, where d is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds. From this, we can also write `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Uniform distribution:** We assume that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant. The number of stars in any given volume `V` is `N = ρ * V`.\n\n2.  **Consider the number of stars in a spherical shell:**\n    *   We want to find the number of stars, `dN`, that have a parallax between `plx` and `plx + d(plx)`. This corresponds to a range of distances.\n    *   A parallax `plx` corresponds to a distance `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   The parallax range from `plx` to `plx + d(plx)` corresponds to a spherical shell of stars at a certain distance. Let's find the volume of this shell.\n    *   The volume of a sphere with radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   The number of stars within a radius `d` is `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   To find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`, we can differentiate `N(d)` with respect to `d`:\n        `dN/dd = d/dd [ρ * (4/3)πd³] = ρ * 4πd²`\n        So, `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`. This is the number of stars in the shell.\n\n3.  **Convert from distance (`d`) to parallax (`plx`):**\n    *   Now, we need to express `dN` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`. We have the following relationships:\n        *   `d = 1/plx`\n        *   To find the relation between the thickness of the shell `dd` and the parallax interval `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n            `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n            So, `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a shell (a positive quantity), we can consider the magnitude of the change: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the parallax expressions into the equation for `dN`:**\n    *   We start with our expression for the number of stars in the shell: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` (using the magnitude).\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms:\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From the equation above, we can divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
