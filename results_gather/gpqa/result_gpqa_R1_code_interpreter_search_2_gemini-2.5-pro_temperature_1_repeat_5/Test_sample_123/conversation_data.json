    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:**\n    The number of particles `N` that have not decayed after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`\n    where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `T` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame of reference where the time `t` is measured (the lab frame).\n\n2.  **Incorporate Relativistic Time Dilation:**\n    The mean lifetime of a particle is a proper quantity, `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame). When the particle is moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` relative to an observer (the lab frame), its lifetime appears longer to the observer due to time dilation. The dilated lifetime `T` is given by:\n    `T = γ * τ`\n    Substituting this into the decay equation, the survival probability `P = N(t)/N₀` in the lab frame is:\n    `P = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n\n3.  **Determine the Time of Flight:**\n    The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector of radius `R = 30` m. They travel this distance to reach the inner walls. The problem states the particles have \"ultra-relativistic velocities,\" which means their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the time of flight `t` in the lab frame can be approximated as:\n    `t ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Survival Probability as a Function of Lorentz Factor:**\n    Substituting the time of flight into the survival probability equation, we get:\n    `P(γ) = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n    Let's group the constants together. Let `k = R / (c * τ)`. This constant `k` depends on the detector size and the intrinsic properties of the particle, but not on its energy (or `γ`). The equation simplifies to:\n    `P(γ) = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n5.  **Use the Initial Conditions to Find the Constant `k`:**\n    We are given that for an initial Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the survival probability is `P₁ = 1/3`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n    To solve for `k`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n    `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor `γ₂`:**\n    We want to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` that results in a survival probability of `P₂ = 2/3`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`:\n    `-ln(3/2) = -k / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = k / γ₂`\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = k / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the expression for `k` we found in step 5 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n    Now, we can compute the numerical value.\n\nTo perform the calculation accurately, we can use a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The derived formula for the new Lorentz factor is:\n# gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n# where gamma_1 = 20\n\ngamma_1 = 20\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_output>\n54.19022585422324\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation shows that `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 40\nC) 68\nD) 28\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The relationship between the survival probability `P` of a particle, its Lorentz factor `γ`, and the distance it travels `R` is given by the formula for relativistic decay:\n\n`P = exp(-t / T)`\n\nwhere `t` is the time of flight in the lab frame and `T` is the mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n1.  **Time of Flight (t):** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time it takes to travel the radius `R` of the detector is:\n    `t ≈ R / c`\n\n2.  **Dilated Lifetime (T):** The mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame `T` is dilated from its proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `T = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Survival Probability Formula:** Substituting `t` and `T` into the probability equation, we get:\n    `P(γ) = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n    We can group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ` into a single constant `k = R / (c * τ)`. The formula simplifies to:\n    `P(γ) = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n4.  **Using Initial Conditions:** We are given that when `γ₁ = 20`, the survival probability `P₁ = 1/3`. We can use this to find the value of `k`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n    `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** We want to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` that results in a survival probability `P₂ = 2/3`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -k / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = k / γ₂`\n    Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = k / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the expression for `k` from step 4 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n    The calculated value is approximately `54.19`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 40\nC) 68\nD) 28\n\nThe value `54.19` is closest to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
