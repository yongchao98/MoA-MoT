    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance X and related compounds by analyzing the chemical clues.**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Gas W.** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine potential simple gas molecules:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely as a reaction product here)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but context points elsewhere)\n        *   Given the next clue about isotopes, D₂ is the strongest candidate for gas W.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance B.** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\".\n        *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n        *   This is a near-perfect match. So, substance B is D₂O (heavy water).\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Precipitate G.** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O)\". This indicates that G is a deuterated hydrate (a compound containing D₂O in its structure) that decomposes upon heating. A common example of a precipitate hydrate is aluminum hydroxide, so the deuterated analog would be aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Heating it would produce aluminum oxide and heavy water: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This fits the description.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: The main reaction.** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G (containing Al(OD)₃)\".\n        *   X must contain Deuterium (D) to produce D₂ gas. It must also contain Aluminum (Al) to form the Al(OD)₃ precipitate.\n        *   If Y reacts with X to form Al(OD)₃ and D₂, Y must be the source of the OD groups. Therefore, Y is most likely D₂O (which is a liquid).\n        *   A substance containing Al and D that reacts violently with water (or heavy water) to produce hydrogen (or deuterium) gas is a complex metal deuteride. This points strongly to Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, LiAlD₄.\n        *   Let's check the reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W). This reaction is known and fits all the clues: it's violent, produces D₂ gas, and forms an aluminum deuteroxide precipitate.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: Organic Reaction.** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has a ketone group (-CO-) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃-CO-COOH).\n        *   \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" The analog of LiAlD₄ is LiAlH₄ (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), a very powerful and common reducing agent.\n        *   LiAlH₄ is strong enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n        *   R-CO-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CD(OH)-CH₂OD (a diol). This product molecule contains two oxygen atoms.\n        *   This confirms that X is a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both functional groups, which is characteristic of LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n3.  **Calculate the required value.**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is **Hydrogen (H)**.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is **Aluminum (Al)**.\n    *   The question specifies: \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we must sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element found in one molecule of X.\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Number of atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms, all of the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   Number of atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom. The stable isotope is ²⁷Al.\n    *   To find the cumulative mass, we sum the mass numbers of these constituent atoms (since the answer options are integers).\n    *   Mass from Hydrogen atoms = 4 × (Mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from Aluminum atoms = 1 × (Mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass from H atoms) + (Mass from Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection.**\n    The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
