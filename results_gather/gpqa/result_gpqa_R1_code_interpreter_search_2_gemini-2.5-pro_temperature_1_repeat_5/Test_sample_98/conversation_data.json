    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n1.  **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n2.  **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe most crucial information comes from the complex splitting patterns described in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four saturated structures.\n2.  **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** For a signal to be split in this manner, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet (n+1=2).\n    *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n    *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), causing a **q**uartet (n+1=4).\n3.  **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** For a signal to be split this way, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet (n+1=2).\n    *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n    *   Another, chemically non-equivalent group of two neighboring protons (n=2), causing another **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe need to find the structure that contains two different protons that would give rise to both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. Let's analyze the methine (CH) protons on the main chain, as they are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    `Et-CH(b)-CH(c)(Et)-COOH`\n    *   Proton **H(b)** at C3 is coupled to the CH2 of its ethyl group (2H), the CH proton at C4 (1H), and the CH2 of the chain (2H). This would give a **dtt**.\n    *   Proton **H(c)** at C4 is coupled to the CH proton at C3 (1H) and the CH2 of its ethyl group (2H). This would give a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n    *   This structure provides a `dtt` but **not** a `dtq`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    `(iPr)-CH(c)(Me)-CH2-COOH`\n    *   Proton **H(c)** at C3 is coupled to the CH at C4 (1H), the CH2 at C2 (2H), and the CH3 on C3 (3H). This would give a **dtq**.\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the CH at C3 (1H) and the two methyl groups of the isopropyl group (6H). This would give a doublet of septets (`ds`).\n    *   This structure provides a `dtq` but **not** a `dtt`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    `Et-CH(c)(Me)-CH(d)(Me)-COOH`\n    *   Proton **H(c)** at C3 is coupled to the CH at C2 (1H), the CH2 of the ethyl group (2H), and the CH3 on C3 (3H). This would give a **dtq**.\n    *   Proton **H(d)** at C2 is coupled to the CH at C3 (1H) and the CH3 on C2 (3H). This would give a doublet of quartets (`dq`).\n    *   This structure provides a `dtq` but **not** a `dtt`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**\n    Let's interpret this condensed formula and draw the structure. It corresponds to 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid.\n    `CH3CH2-CH(c)(CH3)-CH(b)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`\n    Let's analyze the two key methine protons, H(b) and H(c).\n    *   **Proton H(b) (at C3):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The CH proton at C4, **H(c)** (1H) -> **d**oublet\n        *   The CH2 protons at C2 (2H) -> **t**riplet\n        *   The CH2 protons of the ethyl group on C3 (2H) -> **t**riplet\n        *   This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   **Proton H(c) (at C4):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The CH proton at C3, **H(b)** (1H) -> **d**oublet\n        *   The CH2 protons at C5 (2H) -> **t**riplet\n        *   The CH3 protons of the methyl group on C4 (3H) -> **q**uartet\n        *   This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other required signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option B, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, has the correct combination of neighboring protons to produce both a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
