    "This problem describes the process of pair production, where a high-energy gamma-ray (γ) collides with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to create an electron-positron pair (e⁺e⁻). The lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays is limited by this process above a certain energy threshold. We need to calculate this threshold energy.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **The Reaction:** The physical process is:\n    γ (high energy) + γ_CMB (low energy) → e⁺ + e⁻\n\n2.  **Conservation of Four-Momentum:** To find the threshold energy, we apply the principle of conservation of energy and momentum in a relativistic framework. We use four-vectors for this.\n    *   Let `p_γ` be the four-momentum of the high-energy gamma-ray and `p_CMB` be the four-momentum of the CMB photon.\n    *   Let `p_e+` and `p_e-` be the four-momenta of the created positron and electron.\n    *   The conservation law is: `p_γ + p_CMB = p_e+ + p_e-`.\n\n3.  **Invariant Mass:** The square of the total four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it is the same in all inertial reference frames. We can equate the square of the total four-momentum before and after the collision.\n    `(p_γ + p_CMB)² = (p_e+ + p_e-)²`\n\n4.  **Before Collision (Left Side):**\n    *   `(p_γ + p_CMB)² = p_γ² + p_CMB² + 2 * p_γ · p_CMB`\n    *   For any photon, its rest mass is zero, so the square of its four-momentum `p² = m²c⁴` is zero. Thus, `p_γ² = 0` and `p_CMB² = 0`.\n    *   The equation simplifies to `2 * p_γ · p_CMB`.\n    *   The dot product of the four-momenta is `p_γ · p_CMB = E_γ * E_CMB - **p**_γ · **p**_CMB`, where E is energy and **p** is the three-momentum.\n    *   For a photon, `|**p**| = E/c`. In natural units (c=1), `|**p**| = E`.\n    *   So, `**p**_γ · **p**_CMB = |**p**_γ| * |**p**_CMB| * cos(θ) = E_γ * E_CMB * cos(θ)`, where θ is the angle between the two photons.\n    *   The left side becomes `2 * (E_γ * E_CMB - E_γ * E_CMB * cos(θ)) = 2 * E_γ * E_CMB * (1 - cos(θ))`.\n\n5.  **After Collision (Right Side):**\n    *   The threshold energy corresponds to the minimum energy required to create the electron-positron pair. This occurs when the electron and positron are created with no kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   In the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is just the sum of the rest energies of the electron and positron, which is `m_e c² + m_e c² = 2m_e c²`. The total momentum is zero.\n    *   The square of the total four-momentum after the collision is `(2m_e c²)²` (or `(2m_e)²` in natural units).\n\n6.  **Combining and Solving for Threshold Energy:**\n    *   Equating the two sides: `2 * E_γ * E_CMB * (1 - cos(θ)) = (2m_e)² = 4m_e²`.\n    *   Solving for the high-energy photon's energy `E_γ`:\n        `E_γ = 4m_e² / (2 * E_CMB * (1 - cos(θ))) = 2m_e² / (E_CMB * (1 - cos(θ)))`\n    *   To find the *minimum* or *threshold* energy `E_γ`, we need to maximize the denominator. The term `(1 - cos(θ))` is maximized when `cos(θ) = -1`, which corresponds to a head-on collision (θ = 180°). In this case, `1 - cos(θ) = 2`.\n    *   The threshold energy `E_γ_thresh` is:\n        `E_γ_thresh = 2m_e² / (E_CMB * 2) = m_e² / E_CMB`\n\n7.  **Calculation:** Now, we plug in the known values.\n    *   Rest mass of an electron, `m_e` ≈ 0.511 MeV/c² = 0.511 x 10⁶ eV/c².\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, `E_CMB` = 10⁻³ eV.\n    *   We will use natural units where `c=1`.\n    \n    `E_γ_thresh = (0.511 * 10⁶ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)`\n    `E_γ_thresh = (0.261121 * 10¹² eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)`\n    `E_γ_thresh = 0.261121 * 10¹⁵ eV`\n    `E_γ_thresh = 2.61121 * 10¹⁴ eV`\n\n8.  **Convert to GeV:** The options are in Giga-electron-volts (GeV).\n    *   `1 GeV = 10⁹ eV`\n    *   `E_γ_thresh = (2.61121 * 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV) = 2.61121 * 10⁵ GeV`\n\nThis value is approximately `2.6 * 10⁵ GeV`.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, a simple python script can be used.\n```python\n# Physical constants\n# Electron rest mass in electron-volts (eV)\nm_e_eV = 0.511e6\n# Average energy of a Cosmic Microwave Background photon in eV\nE_CMB_eV = 1e-3\n\n# The threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray (E_gamma) to produce an \n# electron-positron pair in a head-on collision with a CMB photon is given by the formula:\n# E_gamma = m_e^2 / E_CMB\nE_gamma_thresh_eV = (m_e_eV**2) / E_CMB_eV\n\n# The question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV).\n# 1 GeV = 1e9 eV\neV_to_GeV = 1e-9\nE_gamma_thresh_GeV = E_gamma_thresh_eV * eV_to_GeV\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation to compare with the options\nprint(f\"{E_gamma_thresh_GeV:.2e} GeV\")\n```\n>>>\n2.61e+05 GeV\n\nThe calculated threshold energy is 2.61 * 10⁵ GeV.

    "The problem asks for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray (γ) that can interact with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron pair (e⁺e⁻). This process is known as pair production.\n\n### 1. The Physics of the Interaction\n\nThe reaction is:\nγ + γ_CMB → e⁺ + e⁻\n\nTo solve this, we use the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum. The four-momentum is a vector `P = (E/c, **p**)` where E is energy and **p** is the three-dimensional momentum. For simplicity, we'll use natural units where the speed of light `c = 1`. In these units, the four-momentum is `P = (E, **p**)`.\n\nThe conservation of four-momentum states that the total four-momentum before the collision is equal to the total four-momentum after the collision:\n`P_γ + P_CMB = P_e+ + P_e-`\n\n### 2. Finding the Threshold Energy\n\nThe square of the total four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames of reference. We can use this property to find the threshold energy.\n\n`(P_γ + P_CMB)² = (P_e+ + P_e-)²`\n\nLet's evaluate both sides:\n\n**Left side (before collision):**\n`(P_γ + P_CMB)² = P_γ² + P_CMB² + 2 * P_γ · P_CMB`\n\n*   For any photon, which is massless, the square of its four-momentum is zero (`P² = E² - |**p**|² = (mc²)² = 0`). Therefore, `P_γ² = 0` and `P_CMB² = 0`.\n*   The equation simplifies to `2 * P_γ · P_CMB`.\n*   The dot product of the four-momenta is `P_γ · P_CMB = E_γ * E_CMB - **p**_γ · **p**_CMB`.\n*   For a photon, the magnitude of its momentum is equal to its energy (`|**p**| = E`). So, `**p**_γ · **p**_CMB = |**p**_γ| * |**p**_CMB| * cos(θ) = E_γ * E_CMB * cos(θ)`, where `θ` is the angle between the two photons.\n*   This gives us `2 * (E_γ * E_CMB - E_γ * E_CMB * cos(θ)) = 2 * E_γ * E_CMB * (1 - cos(θ))`.\n\n**Right side (after collision):**\nAt the threshold energy, the electron and positron are created with the minimum possible kinetic energy. In the center-of-mass frame, they are created at rest.\n*   The total energy in the center-of-mass frame is the sum of the rest energies of the electron and positron: `E_total_CM = m_e + m_e = 2m_e`.\n*   The total momentum in this frame is zero.\n*   The square of the total four-momentum after the collision is `(E_total_CM)² = (2m_e)² = 4m_e²`.\n\n**Combining both sides:**\n`2 * E_γ * E_CMB * (1 - cos(θ)) = 4m_e²`\n\nSolving for the gamma-ray energy `E_γ`:\n`E_γ = 4m_e² / (2 * E_CMB * (1 - cos(θ))) = 2m_e² / (E_CMB * (1 - cos(θ)))`\n\nTo find the minimum or threshold energy `E_γ`, we need to maximize the denominator. The term `(1 - cos(θ))` is at its maximum when `cos(θ) = -1`, which corresponds to a head-on collision (`θ` = 180°). In this case, `1 - cos(θ) = 2`.\n\nThe threshold energy `E_γ_thresh` is therefore:\n`E_γ_thresh = 2m_e² / (E_CMB * 2) = m_e² / E_CMB`\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nNow we can plug in the known values:\n*   Rest energy of an electron (`m_e`): `0.511 MeV = 0.511 * 10⁶ eV`\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon (`E_CMB`): `10⁻³ eV`\n\n`E_γ_thresh = (0.511 * 10⁶ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)`\n`E_γ_thresh = (0.261121 * 10¹² eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)`\n`E_γ_thresh = 0.261121 * 10¹⁵ eV = 2.61121 * 10¹⁴ eV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where `1 GeV = 10⁹ eV`.\n\n`E_γ_thresh (GeV) = (2.61121 * 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)`\n`E_γ_thresh ≈ 2.61 * 10⁵ GeV`\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a simple script.\n```python\n# Constants\n# Electron rest energy in eV\nm_e_eV = 0.511e6\n# Average energy of a Cosmic Microwave Background photon in eV\nE_CMB_eV = 1e-3\n\n# Threshold energy formula for pair production from two photons\n# E_gamma = m_e^2 / E_CMB\nE_gamma_thresh_eV = (m_e_eV**2) / E_CMB_eV\n\n# Convert the result from eV to GeV (1 GeV = 1e9 eV)\nE_gamma_thresh_GeV = E_gamma_thresh_eV / 1e9\n\n# The options are in the format of X.X * 1eY, so we format the output similarly.\nprint(f\"The threshold energy is approximately {E_gamma_thresh_GeV:.2e} GeV\")\n```\n>>>\nThe threshold energy is approximately 2.61e+05 GeV\n\nThe calculated value is 2.61 * 10⁵ GeV, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
