    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    *   Formation: $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    *   Dissociation: $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n    (Note: EDTA is represented as $Y^{4-}$ for the fully deprotonated form).\n\n2.  **Write the formation constant expression:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the equilibrium for the formation reaction.\n    *   $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex, $[CaY]^{2-}$, and we want to find how much of it dissociates to find the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions that form upon dissociation.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $Y^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n    The problem states the pH is \"ideal,\" which means we can assume all uncomplexed EDTA is in the $Y^{4-}$ form, so we don't need to worry about pH-dependent protonation of EDTA.\n\n4.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:**\n    *   $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:** The formation constant ($5 \\times 10^{10}$) is a very large number. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the approximation:\n    *   $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    Now, the equation becomes:\n    *   $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    *   $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Now, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    *   $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x'.\n\n6.  **Final Answer:**\n    *   $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nThis matches option B.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex in M\nC_complex = 0.02\n\n# Formation constant for Ca-EDTA\nK_f = 5e10\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_f = (C_complex - x) / x^2\n# Since K_f is very large, we can approximate C_complex - x as C_complex.\n# So, K_f ≈ C_complex / x^2\n# Rearranging for x^2 gives: x^2 = C_complex / K_f\n# x is the concentration of Ca2+ ions.\n\nx_squared = C_complex / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user has provided the following question: \"What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.\"\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[CaY]^{2-}$, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$), which describes the formation of the complex. The relevant reaction for our calculation is the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse of the formation.\n\n    *   Formation reaction: $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    *   Formation constant expression: $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n2.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We start with an initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex of 0.02 M. We want to find the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $Y^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n    *The problem states the pH is \"ideal,\" which means we assume the EDTA that dissociates is fully in its $Y^{4-}$ form, simplifying the calculation.*\n\n3.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the K_f expression:**\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n4.  **Simplify and solve for x:** The formation constant ($5 \\times 10^{10}$) is extremely large. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex), and therefore, the amount of dissociation ('x') will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make a simplifying approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    This simplifies the equation to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Calculate x:** Rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Now, take the square root to find x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n6.  **Final Answer:** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x'.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n    This value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
