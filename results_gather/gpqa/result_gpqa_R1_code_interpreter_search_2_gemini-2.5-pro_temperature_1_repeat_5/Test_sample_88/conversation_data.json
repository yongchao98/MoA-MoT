    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). Adamantane has a tricyclic cage structure with 3 degrees of unsaturation.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh conditions suggesting a rearrangement, not a simple substitution or elimination (which is disfavored by Bredt's rule at the bridgehead positions).\n*   **Spectral Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone in a six-membered or strained ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The integration (2H + 10H + 2H = 14H) combined with the loss of two Br atoms and gain of one O atom from the starting material (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂) leads to a molecular formula of **C₁₀H₁₄O**.\n    *   The chemical shift at **4.79 ppm (2H)** is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond). The integration (2H) and singlet-like appearance suggest an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n    *   **Ozonolysis in Step 3:** The fact that a subsequent step involves ozonolysis confirms that Product 1 (and Product 2) must contain a C=C double bond.\n*   **Structural Deduction:**\n    *   We need to find a structure with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DoU). For a C₁₀ compound, a saturated acyclic formula would be C₁₀H₂₂O. DoU = (H_saturated - H_actual) / 2 = (22 - 14) / 2 = 4.\n    *   The structure contains one ketone (C=O, 1 DoU) and one alkene (C=C, 1 DoU). This accounts for 2 DoU.\n    *   Therefore, the remaining 2 DoU must come from a bicyclic ring system (2 rings).\n    *   This means the reaction involves a rearrangement that opens one of the rings of the tricyclic adamantane skeleton.\n    *   A structure that fits all these criteria is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n        *   It has a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core (2 rings).\n        *   It has a ketone at position 3 (C=O).\n        *   It has an exocyclic methylene group at position 7 (C=CH₂).\n        *   Its formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n        *   The two protons of the =CH₂ group would account for the NMR signal at ~4.79 ppm.\n        *   The ketone in the six-membered ring is consistent with the IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   This is a known, albeit complex, rearrangement product under these conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. It selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols, without affecting C=C double bonds.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol. The structure is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol).\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by 2. Dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup. It cleaves the C=C double bond.\n    *   The exocyclic double bond (C₇=CH₂) is cleaved.\n    *   The carbon of the ring (C₇) becomes a ketone (C₇=O).\n    *   The external CH₂ group becomes formaldehyde (HCHO), which is typically not the product of interest.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting molecule is **3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**. It is a bicyclic molecule containing both an alcohol (-OH) and a ketone (C=O) group.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** 3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C9 (the methylene bridge), and C7.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In a molecule with alkyl, alcohol, and ketone functionalities, the most deshielded proton (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton) is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton). This is the proton at **C3 (H3)**. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm, significantly higher than protons alpha to a ketone (~2.5 ppm) or other alkyl protons.\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H3:**\n    *   To determine the splitting pattern (multiplicity) of H3, we look at the number of adjacent protons using the n+1 rule.\n    *   H3 is on C3, which is bonded to C2 and C4.\n    *   There are two protons on C2 and two protons on C4. Thus, H3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an identical environment to the two protons on C4. However, the two protons on C2 itself (e.g., one axial, one equatorial) are not equivalent to each other.\n    *   Let's denote the protons on C2 as H2a and H2b, and on C4 as H4a and H4b.\n    *   Because of the symmetry, the coupling constant between H3 and H2a is identical to the coupling between H3 and H4a (let's call this J₁).\n    *   Similarly, the coupling constant between H3 and H2b is identical to the coupling between H3 and H4b (let's call this J₂).\n    *   Based on the Karplus relationship of dihedral angles in a chair-like ring, J₁ and J₂ will be different.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H3 is split by two equivalent protons with coupling constant J₁, and by two other equivalent protons with coupling constant J₂.\n    *   Splitting by the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) gives a triplet.\n    *   Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2), which also gives a triplet.\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
