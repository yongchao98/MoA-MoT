    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Process**\n\nThe problem asks for the transition route and probability for a hydrogen atom to decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via a two-step process involving two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This is a cascade decay process.\n\nThe overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nWe need to identify the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ and calculate the probability of this specific cascade path.\n\n**2. Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition from an initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$ to a final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle$ are:\n*   **Parity change:** The parity of the state, given by $(-1)^l$, must change. This implies that the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i$, must be odd. For one-photon E1 transitions, this is restricted to $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic quantum number change:** The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i$, can be $0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Principal quantum number change:** The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n = n_f - n_i$, can be any integer. For a decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so $E_{n_f} < E_{n_i}$, which implies $n_f < n_i$.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to the first transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   Initial state: $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n*   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n*   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n*   $\\Delta n = n' - 3$. For decay, $n' < 3$. The most probable E1 transitions occur between adjacent n-levels when allowed. The options provided in the question suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$. Let's verify this is a valid step. A transition to $n'=2, l'=1$ is allowed. A direct transition to $n'=1$ would require $l'=1$, which is not possible for $n=1$ (where $l=0$). So the intermediate state must have $n' \\ge 2$. We assume the cascade proceeds through the $n'=2$ level as suggested by the options.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   $|2,1,-1\\rangle$\n*   $|2,1,0\\rangle$\n*   $|2,1,1\\rangle$\n\nNow, let's check the second transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Initial state: $n_i=2, l_i=1, m_i=m'$.\n*   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0 - m'$. Since $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$, $\\Delta m$ can be $+1, 0, -1$, respectively. All these are allowed transitions.\n\nThus, all three routes through the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probabilities**\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\nProbability(route via $|2,1,m'\\rangle$) = (Branching Ratio for step 1) $\\times$ (Branching Ratio for step 2)\n\n**Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n\nThe transition rate (and hence the probability) for an E1 transition from state $|i\\rangle$ to $|f\\rangle$ is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the electric dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\vec{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d} = -e\\vec{r}$.\nRate$(i \\to f) \\propto |\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2$.\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, the atom does not have a preferred orientation in space. As a result, the decay rates to the three degenerate final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal.\n\nLet's verify this with a calculation. The rate is proportional to:\n$A(m') \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m' | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\nThis calculation involves a radial integral (which is the same for all three $m'$) and an angular integral over spherical harmonics. A detailed calculation shows:\n*   For $m' = 0$: The transition is driven by the $z$ component. $A(0) \\propto |\\langle 2,1,0 | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n*   For $m' = \\pm 1$: The transition is driven by the $x$ and $y$ components. $A(\\pm 1) \\propto |\\langle 2,1,\\pm 1 | x | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,\\pm 1 | y | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n\nThe result of these calculations is that the matrix elements are such that the rates are equal:\n$A(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,-1) = A(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0) = A(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,1)$.\n\nThe total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ via E1 is the sum of these three rates. Since direct decay to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden ($\\Delta l=0$), these are the only significant E1 decay channels.\nTotal Rate = $A(-1) + A(0) + A(1)$.\nSince they are equal, let's call the rate for each channel $A$. The total rate is $3A$.\n\nThe branching ratio for a specific channel $m'$ is:\n$BR_1(m') = \\frac{A(m')}{\\text{Total Rate}} = \\frac{A}{3A} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSo, the atom has a $1/3$ probability of landing in each of the three intermediate states.\n\n**Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nNow we consider the decay from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. This state is part of the $2p$ subshell. We need to find its possible E1 decay channels.\n*   The only lower energy level is $n=1$.\n*   For $n=1$, the only possible orbital quantum number is $l=0$. So the only possible final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   The transition from $l=1$ to $l=0$ is allowed by the $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$ rule.\n\nSince there is only one possible final state for the decay of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state via an E1 transition, the atom will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of 1 (or 100%).\nSo, the branching ratio for the second step is 1, regardless of which intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) was populated.\n\n**5. Final Probability and Conclusion**\n\nThe total probability for a specific cascade route is:\n*   For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    Probability = $BR_1(m'=0) \\times BR_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    Probability = $BR_1(m'=1) \\times BR_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    Probability = $BR_1(m'=-1) \\times BR_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nNow, we compare our results with the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
