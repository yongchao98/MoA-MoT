    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material, C8H9NO.**\n\nWe are given the molecular formula and the 1H-NMR data. Let's analyze the data to deduce the structure.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE). The C=O bond of an aldehyde would account for this.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH2- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for an amine group (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton (the aldehyde proton, -CHO).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent contains the remaining atoms: C8H9NO - C6H4(NH2) = C2H3O.\n    *   This C2H3O fragment must be the -CH2-CHO group (an acetaldehyde group).\n    *   Let's check the coupling: The -CH2- (3.66 ppm) is adjacent to the -CHO (9.72 ppm). The CH2 protons split the CHO proton into a triplet (n=2, so n+1=3). The CHO proton splits the CH2 protons into a doublet (n=1, so n+1=2). This matches the observed multiplicities perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is the diazotization reaction. It converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product after this step is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt (often with gentle heating) causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a hydrolysis reaction where N2 gas is evolved.\n    The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde that has two acidic α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the C=O group).\n    Aldehydes with α-hydrogens undergo a base-catalyzed **aldol condensation**.\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** A base (OH-) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        In this case, the addition product would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option B).\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heat provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon and a hydrogen on the α-carbon are removed, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This dehydration step is highly favorable because it creates a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is very stable.\n\nThe final product is this stable, dehydrated condensation product. Let's determine its structure and name.\n\n*   **Addition Product:** 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal\n    HO-Ph-CH₂(β)-CH(β)(OH)-CH(α)(Ph-OH)-CHO\n*   **Dehydration:** Remove H from the α-carbon and OH from the β-carbon.\n    This forms a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3 of the butanal chain).\n*   **Final Product:**\n    HO-Ph-CH₂(4)-CH(3)=C(2)(Ph-OH)-CHO\n    The IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. The product should have hydroxyl groups, and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect. This is not the product of a self-condensation reaction; it only contains one phenyl ring.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the correct structure and name for the final aldol condensation product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
