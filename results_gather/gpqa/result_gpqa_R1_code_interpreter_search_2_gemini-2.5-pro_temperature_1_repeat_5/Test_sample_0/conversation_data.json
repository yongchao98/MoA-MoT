    "This problem is based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle states that the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) are related by the formula:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). The term ΔE represents the natural linewidth or the inherent uncertainty in the energy of the state.\n\nFor a state with lifetime τ, the energy uncertainty is approximately:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nWe have two quantum states with lifetimes:\n*   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state.\n\nFor the first state:\nΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nFor the second state:\nΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, their energy difference (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. This ensures that the energy distributions (which have a width of ΔE) do not overlap too much.\n\nRequired condition: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\nLet's calculate the minimum required energy difference:\n|E₁ - E₂| > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n|E₁ - E₂| > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n|E₁ - E₂| > 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow we must examine the given options to find one that satisfies this condition:\nA) 10⁻⁸ eV (which is 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is NOT greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nB) 10⁻¹¹ eV is NOT greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nC) 10⁻⁹ eV is NOT greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nD) 10⁻⁴ eV is clearly greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nTherefore, an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV would be sufficient to clearly resolve these two energy levels.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using the uncertainty principle (ΔE ≈ ħ/τ)\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties.\nmin_required_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"The energy uncertainty for the first state (ΔE1) is approximately: {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The energy uncertainty for the second state (ΔE2) is approximately: {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The sum of uncertainties (minimum required separation) is: {min_required_difference:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Given options\noption_A = 1e-8\noption_B = 1e-11\noption_C = 1e-9\noption_D = 1e-4\n\nprint(f\"\\nChecking the options against the required separation of {min_required_difference:.3e} eV:\")\nprint(f\"Option A (1e-8 eV): {'Sufficient' if option_A > min_required_difference else 'Not sufficient'}\")\nprint(f\"Option B (1e-11 eV): {'Sufficient' if option_B > min_required_difference else 'Not sufficient'}\")\nprint(f\"Option C (1e-9 eV): {'Sufficient' if option_C > min_required_difference else 'Not sufficient'}\")\nprint(f\"Option D (1e-4 eV): {'Sufficient' if option_D > min_required_difference else 'Not sufficient'}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we use the time-energy uncertainty principle, which states that the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE), also known as its natural linewidth, is related to its lifetime (τ) by the relation:\n\nΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). For practical purposes, we can approximate the energy width as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state.**\n\n*   **For the first state (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s):**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the second state (τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s):**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Step 2: Determine the condition for resolving the two energy levels.**\n\nTo clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, their energy difference (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. This ensures that their energy distributions (which have widths of ΔE₁ and ΔE₂) do not significantly overlap.\n\nRequired condition: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the minimum required energy difference.**\n\nSum of uncertainties = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nSum = (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\nSum = (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\nSum = 7.2402 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, the energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Step 4: Compare this requirement with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is *less than* 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV. This is *less than* 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is *less than* 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV.
