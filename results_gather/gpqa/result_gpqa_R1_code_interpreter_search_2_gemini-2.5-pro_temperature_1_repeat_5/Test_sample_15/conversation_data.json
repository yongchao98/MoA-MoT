    "A molecule is optically active if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (or chiral center), which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. However, the ultimate test for chirality is the absence of any plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i) in any conformation of the molecule. Molecules that have stereocenters but are achiral due to internal symmetry are called meso compounds.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `ClCH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. The molecule is built around a C=C double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This planarity introduces a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), making the molecule **achiral** and thus optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex molecule. The name itself provides the key information. It specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of a double bond (E). The designation of specific R and S configurations means that a single enantiomer is being described. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is by definition **chiral** and optically active. It is extremely unlikely for such a complex, asymmetric structure to possess a plane of symmetry or center of inversion that would make it a meso compound.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). The molecule is symmetric, with identical groups (COOH) at both ends. The designation (2R,3S) indicates that the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. In a molecule with two stereocenters and identical ends, the (R,S) or (S,R) stereoisomer is a meso compound. A meso compound has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it **achiral** and optically inactive. In this case, there is a center of inversion halfway along the C2-C3 bond.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. Here, both stereocenters have the same configuration (R,R). This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,2S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable enantiomers. Therefore, the (2R,3R) isomer is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and an alcohol group (at C1). Carbon-1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH= (part of the ring), and -CH₂- (part of the ring). Thus, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer. The molecule as a whole does not have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The 's' notation typically indicates a *syn* or *cis* relationship. This describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule is highly symmetric. In its chair conformation, it possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σᵥ). The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral** and optically inactive. Note that carbons 1, 3, and 5 are not true stereocenters because the paths around the ring from each of these carbons are identical.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. Let's check for chirality. There are no stereocenters in this molecule. The carbon of the C=O group is sp² hybridized. No carbon in the isobutyl chain (-CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂) is bonded to four different groups. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry which contains the carbonyl group and the isobutyl chain, and bisects the cyclopentyl ring. Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe optically active (chiral) compounds from the list are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
