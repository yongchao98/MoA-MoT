    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are located at positions 1, 2, and 3, which is a highly congested arrangement. We need to consider the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (alkoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-directing.\n*   **-tBu (alkyl):** Activating, ortho, para-directing. It is very bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at the ortho positions.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   Intermediate groups are also important: -NH2 (strongly activating, o,p-director), -NH3+ (strongly deactivating, m-director), -SO3H (strongly deactivating, m-director).\n\n**2. Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies**\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene is challenging due to competing directing effects. Let's consider the order of introducing the groups.\n\n*   **Final step is nitration (-NO2):** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-2-(tert-butyl)benzene. The -OEt group is a much stronger director than -tBu. It would direct nitration to positions 4 (para) and 6 (ortho). The desired position 3 is ortho to the -tBu group but meta to the -OEt group. This would be a very minor product, so this is not a high-yield synthesis.\n*   **Final step is alkylation (-tBu):** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Both -OEt (o,p) and -NO2 (m) direct to positions 2, 4, and 6. The desired position 2 is sterically hindered by both adjacent groups. This would not be a high-yield reaction.\n*   **Final step is etherification (-OEt):** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol. Synthesizing this intermediate itself is very difficult via direct substitution methods.\n\nGiven the difficulty, a more complex strategy involving blocking groups or manipulation of functional groups via diazonium salts is likely required.\n\n**3. Analyze the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option as written. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies a sequence of regioselective reactions.\n\n*   **Option A:** `...iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...` This sequence is chemically incorrect. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid of a nitro compound, not an amine.\n\n*   **Option B:** `...ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...` This sequence involves Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline (product of step ii). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on rings with strongly activating groups like -NH2 (which complexes with the Lewis acid catalyst AlCl3) and on strongly deactivated rings. The Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amine group, forming a deactivating -NH3+ complex, which prevents the desired reaction.\n\n*   **Option D:** `...v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` This sequence proposes the nitration of a diazonium salt (formed in step v). This is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation.\n\n*   **Option C:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n    `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is o,p-directing, but due to its bulk, the para product, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**, is formed in very high yield.\n    `iii) Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. This is a critical step. In a strong acidic medium (H2SO4), the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a meta-director, and the -tBu group is an ortho,para-director. Let's see where they direct on the 4-tert-butylanilinium ion:\n        - -NH3+ (at C1) directs to C3 and C5.\n        - -tBu (at C4) directs to C2 and C6.\n        This leads to a conflict and likely a mixture of products. *However*, an alternative interpretation is that the reaction is performed under conditions that favor nitration of the N-acetylated derivative (acetanilide), which is a common strategy. If we consider the nitration of the anilinium ion, there is an error in the previous reasoning. Both groups direct to the same positions:\n        - -NH3+ (at C1) directs meta to positions 3 and 5.\n        - -tBu (at C4) directs ortho to positions 3 and 5.\n        Therefore, nitration should occur cleanly at position 3 (or 5), yielding **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    Let's trace the synthesis from **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**:\n    `v) NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt: **3-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium salt**.\n    `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming **3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n    `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: The phenol is converted to an ether (Williamson ether synthesis), yielding **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nThis final product is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule, but not the target molecule itself (2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene). The steps `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4` at the end are superfluous and make no sense after the ether has been formed.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the question, as none of the provided sequences logically lead to the specified target molecule in high yield. Options A, B, and D contain chemically nonsensical steps. Option C outlines a chemically plausible and high-yield synthesis for a specific isomer (**1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**), even though it is not the isomer requested in the question title, and it includes two extra, misplaced steps at the end.\n\nGiven that options A, B, and D are fundamentally incorrect due to invalid reaction steps, Option C is the only choice that represents a coherent, albeit flawed, synthetic plan. It is the most plausible answer, assuming errors exist in the problem statement (either the target molecule's name or the final steps of the sequence).\n\n<<<C>>>"
