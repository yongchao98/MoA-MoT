    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an electrically neutral (initially uncharged) spherical conductor with a cavity inside. A positive point charge, $+q$, is placed within this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. If we imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the net electric flux through it must be zero. For the electric field to be zero everywhere on this surface, the total charge enclosed must be zero. Since there is a charge of $+q$ inside the cavity, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This induced charge $-q$ will distribute itself on the inner surface in a non-uniform way, depending on the exact position of the charge $+q$.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has been drawn to the inner surface from the bulk of the conductor, a net positive charge of $+q$ is left behind. In electrostatic equilibrium, this excess charge will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields its exterior from the electrostatic influence of any charges placed inside it. The combined electric field at any point outside the conductor due to the original charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface is exactly zero. Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *solely* by the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$. Since the conductor is a sphere and there are no other external charges mentioned in the problem, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface. The non-uniformity of the charge distribution on the inner surface does not affect the distribution on the outer surface due to the shielding effect.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at any point outside the shell is identical to the field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer shell = $+q$.\n    *   Center of the spherical conductor = O.\n    *   Distance of the point P from the center O = $L$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The electric field at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge $+q$ located at O. Using Coulomb's Law, the magnitude of this field is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The problem provides extra information such as the cavity's radius ($r$), its offset from the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and an angle ($\\theta$). This information is irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding.\n    *   The calculated field, $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
