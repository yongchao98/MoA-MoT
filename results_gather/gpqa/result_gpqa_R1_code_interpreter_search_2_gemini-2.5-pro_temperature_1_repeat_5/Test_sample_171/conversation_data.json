    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics**: The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the atmospheres of two stars. Since the stars' photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe the distribution of atoms among different energy states.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy levels, say an excited state 'e' and a ground state 'g'. The ratio of their populations (N_e / N_g) is given by:\n\n    N_e / N_g = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    Where:\n    *   N_e, N_g are the number of atoms in the excited and ground states.\n    *   g_e, g_g are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the excited and ground states. For a given atom (iron in this case) and a specific transition, this ratio is a constant.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state (E_e - E_g).\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.3806 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars**: We can write the Boltzmann equation for each star. Let T_1 be the temperature of star_1 and T_2 be the temperature of star_2.\n\n    *   For star_1: (N_e1 / N_g1) = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    *   For star_2: (N_e2 / N_g2) = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Observational Data**: The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... as in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the ground state for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2.\n\n    (N_e1 / N_g1) = 2 * (N_e2 / N_g2)\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations**: Now, substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the observational relationship:\n\n    (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n6.  **Simplify**: The statistical weight ratio (g_e / g_g) is the same for both stars (it's a property of the iron atom's energy levels) and cancels out from both sides:\n\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n7.  **Solve for the Temperatures**: To find the relationship between T_1 and T_2, we need to manipulate this equation. Taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides is a good strategy to deal with the exponentials.\n\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n    Using the logarithm property ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b):\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Isolate ln(2)**: Rearrange the terms to get an expression for ln(2).\n\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n9.  **Factor and Combine**: Factor out the common term (ΔE / k) and combine the fractions.\n\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n10. **Substitute the Numerical Values**: The problem provides the necessary values:\n    *   Energy difference, ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n    *   Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n    Calculate the ratio ΔE / k:\n\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    This convenient choice of numbers simplifies the equation significantly.\n\n11. **Final Equation**: Substitute the value of (ΔE / k) = 1 back into the equation.\n\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n12. **Conclusion**: This derived equation matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
