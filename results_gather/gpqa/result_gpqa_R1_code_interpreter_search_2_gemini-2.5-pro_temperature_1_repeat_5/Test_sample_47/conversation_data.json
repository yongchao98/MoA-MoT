    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring containing a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate, where a bromine atom is added to the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n*   **Product 1:** Since cyclohexanone is symmetric, both α-carbons are equivalent. The product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (a strong base), with heat.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. When an α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon (α'-carbon) is treated with a strong base, it undergoes a rearrangement.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack, displacing the bromide ion from C2 and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone ring.\n    4.  The three-membered ring opens to form a more stable carbanion, which is then protonated (by water, formed in the first step) to yield a carboxylic acid with a rearranged, smaller ring.\n*   **Product 2:** The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone is converted into a five-membered ring. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n \n\n*(Note: An alternative reaction, E2 elimination, to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is less likely because the subsequent reaction with SOCl₂/pyridine is not a standard transformation for an enone, whereas it is a standard reaction for a carboxylic acid.)*\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (acid chloride). Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** **Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a selective reduction. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is known to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes and stop at that stage, preventing over-reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** **Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n \n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThe final question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to the number of unique signals expected in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n\nDue to this symmetry:\n*   The carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5) are chemically equivalent.\n*   The carbons C3 and C4 are chemically equivalent.\n\nNow let's count the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This hydrogen is in a unique electronic environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is a methine proton bonded to the ring and the aldehyde group. It is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The CH₂ groups at C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, within each CH₂ group, the two protons are diastereotopic because they are on a prochiral carbon next to a stereocenter (C1). This means they are chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, the two \"cis\" protons (one on C2, one on C5) form one equivalent set, and the two \"trans\" protons form another equivalent set. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The CH₂ groups at C3 and C4 are equivalent. Similar to the protons on C2/C5, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, and thus non-equivalent. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C4 equivalent to their counterparts on C3. This gives two more sets of equivalent protons. (2 types)\n\n**Total count of distinct hydrogen types:**\n*   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
