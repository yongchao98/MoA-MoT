    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThis problem involves a particle decay. The fundamental principles governing such processes are:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\nSince the speeds of the particles are likely a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Define Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A positive pion (π⁺) is at rest.\n    *   Initial momentum, **p_initial = 0**.\n    *   Initial energy, **E_initial**, is purely its rest mass energy, since it's stationary (Kinetic Energy = 0). So, E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν) are produced.\n    *   Final momentum, **p_final = p_μ + p_ν**.\n    *   Final energy, **E_final = E_μ + E_ν**.\n        *   E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc² (Energy of the muon)\n        *   E_ν = KE_ν + m_νc² (Energy of the neutrino)\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   p_initial = p_final\n    *   0 = p_μ + p_ν\n    *   This implies that the momentum vectors of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: **p_μ = -p_ν**. Let's denote the magnitude of their momentum as 'p'. So, |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**4. Incorporate Relativistic Formulas and Assumptions**\n\n*   **Neutrino Mass:** In most particle physics problems at this level, the neutrino's mass is considered to be zero (m_ν ≈ 0). This is a very good approximation.\n    *   For a massless particle, its energy is given by E_ν = |p_ν|c = pc.\n    *   Since a massless particle has no rest mass, all its energy is kinetic energy. So, **KE_ν = E_ν = pc**.\n\n*   **Muon Energy:** The muon has mass, so we use the full relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    *   E_μ² = (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   So, E_μ = √[(pc)² + (m_μc²)²]\n\n**5. Solve the Equations**\n\nSubstitute the expressions for E_μ and E_ν into the energy conservation equation:\nm_πc² = √[(pc)² + (m_μc²)²] + pc\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for `pc`.\n1.  Rearrange the equation:\n    m_πc² - pc = √[(pc)² + (m_μc²)²]\n\n2.  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\n3.  The (pc)² term cancels out on both sides:\n    (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_μc²)²\n\n4.  Solve for `pc`:\n    2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²\n    pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nWe can now use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate pc using the derived formula. \n# The value of pc is numerically equal to the neutrino's energy in MeV.\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) is equal to pc\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energies.\n# Q = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n# This Q-value is shared between the two product particles: Q = KE_mu + KE_nu\n# Therefore, KE_mu = Q - KE_nu\nKE_mu = (m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2) - KE_nu\n\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of the muon (μ+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (ν): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nKinetic Energy of the muon (μ+): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of the neutrino (ν): 29.78 MeV\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This decay is governed by the conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial pion (π⁺) is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the two product particles, the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν), must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   **p_initial** = 0\n*   **p_final** = **p_μ** + **p_ν** = 0\n*   This implies **p_μ** = -**p_ν**, and their magnitudes are equal: |**p_μ**| = |**p_ν**| = p.\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. We will use relativistic energy expressions.\n*   **E_initial** = Rest energy of the pion = m_πc²\n*   **E_final** = Energy of the muon (E_μ) + Energy of the neutrino (E_ν)\n*   So, m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy Formulas**\n*   For the muon (a massive particle): E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n*   For the neutrino, we assume it is massless (a standard approximation in this context). For a massless particle, its energy is E_ν = pc, and all of its energy is kinetic energy (KE_ν).\n\n**4. Solving for the Unknowns**\nSubstitute the energy expressions into the conservation of energy equation:\nm_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\nNow, we solve for the momentum magnitude `p` (or more conveniently, `pc`):\n1.  Rearrange: m_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n2.  Square both sides: (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n3.  Expand the left side: (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n4.  The (pc)² terms cancel out. Rearrange to solve for `pc`:\n    2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²\n    pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\n**5. Calculation**\nUsing the given rest mass energies:\n*   m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   m_μc² = 105.7 MeV\n\nFirst, calculate `pc`. This value is also the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν).\n*   pc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\n*   pc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\n*   pc = 8315.67 / 279.2\n*   pc ≈ 29.78 MeV\n*   Therefore, **KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNext, find the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ). The total energy released as kinetic energy is the difference in rest mass energies before and after the decay.\n*   Total KE = m_πc² - m_μc²\n*   Total KE = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two product particles:\n*   Total KE = KE_μ + KE_ν\n*   KE_μ = Total KE - KE_ν\n*   KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV\n*   **KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
