    "The user wants to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance and the distance itself.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    The number of stars, let's call it N, varies with parallax (plx) as:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n2.  **Recall the relationship between parallax and distance:**\n    Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r). The standard formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    where plx is in arcseconds and r is in parsecs. Therefore, `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Substitute the parallax-distance relationship into the given star count relation:**\n    We are given `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we can substitute `1/r` for `plx` in the proportionality:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n\n    This means the *cumulative* number of stars up to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n4.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of distance:**\n    The question asks for how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This is the rate of change of N with respect to r, which is the derivative `dN/dr`. This quantity represents the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance r.\n\n    We have the proportionality `N ∝ r^5`. Let's introduce a constant of proportionality, k, to make it an equation:\n    `N = k * r^5`\n\n    Now, we differentiate N with respect to r:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (`d(x^n)/dx = n*x^(n-1)`):\n    `dN/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = 5k * r^4`\n\n    This shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) ~ r^5 (This is the cumulative number of stars, N)\n    B) ~ r^4 (This matches our result for dN/dr)\n    C) ~ r^3\n    D) ~ r^2 (This would be the case for a uniform star distribution)\n\nThe correct answer is that the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r^4`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
