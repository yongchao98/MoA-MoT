    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Identify the Physical Quantities to Compare**\n\nWe need to compare two energy values:\n1.  **The paramagnetic coupling term**, which we'll denote as $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$. This is the energy shift caused by the interaction of the atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field (Zeeman effect).\n2.  **The transition energy**, denoted as $\\Delta E$, which is the energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during an electron transition in the Hydrogen atom.\n\n### **2. Formulate and Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Term**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic interaction (linear Zeeman effect) is given by:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic dipole moment operator, given by $\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$.\n*   $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n*   $\\vec{L}$ is the orbital angular momentum operator.\n*   $e$ is the elementary charge.\n*   $m_e$ is the mass of the electron.\n\nSubstituting $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ into the Hamiltonian, we get:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product becomes:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} L_z B$\n\nThe energy of this interaction is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$. The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is a fundamental constant known as the **Bohr magneton**, $\\mu_B$.\n$\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$\n\nSo, the energy is:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1 \\text{ T}$\n*   $m$ is a \"small value\". For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can take the smallest non-zero integer value, $m=1$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\times 1 \\times (1 \\text{ T})$\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\n### **3. Formulate and Calculate the Transition Energy**\n\nThe energy of a photon, $\\Delta E$, is related to its wavelength, $\\lambda$, by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant, $h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light, $c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s}$.\n*   $\\lambda$ is the given wavelength, $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the transition energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n$\\Delta E \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\n### **4. Compare the Orders of Magnitude**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nTo compare them, let's find their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThe ratio is a very small number, on the order of $10^{-5}$. This clearly indicates that the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term is significantly smaller than the transition energy. This relationship is expressed as:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis result is expected, as the Zeeman splitting (energy shifts due to magnetic fields) is a fine-structure effect, which is much smaller than the energy differences between principal electronic shells (which are typically in the electron-volt range, as seen in visible light transitions).\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nmu_B = 9.274e-24  # Bohr magneton in J/T\nh = 6.626e-34    # Planck's constant in J.s\nc = 2.998e8      # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Given values\nB = 1.0          # Magnetic field in T\nm = 1            # Small orbital magnetic quantum number\nlambda_um = 0.4861 # Wavelength in micrometers\nlambda_m = lambda_um * 1e-6 # Wavelength in meters\n\n# Calculate the paramagnetic coupling term\nH_coupling = mu_B * m * B\n\n# Calculate the transition energy\ndelta_E = (h * c) / lambda_m\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling term <H>: {H_coupling:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E:      {delta_E:.4e} J\")\n\n# Compare the two values\nratio = H_coupling / delta_E\nprint(f\"Ratio <H> / Delta E:          {ratio:.4e}\")\n\nif ratio < 0.001: # A small threshold to represent \"much less than\"\n    print(\"Conclusion: <H> << Delta E\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The relationship is not <<.\")\n\n```\n<execute_result>\nParamagnetic coupling term <H>: 9.2740e-24 J\nTransition energy Delta E:      4.0869e-19 J\nRatio <H> / Delta E:          2.2692e-05\nConclusion: <H> << Delta E\n</execute_result>\n\nThe code confirms that the paramagnetic coupling term is about $2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$ times the transition energy. Therefore, $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$ is much, much smaller than $\\Delta E$.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The code execution confirms the manual calculation.\n\n*   **Paramagnetic coupling energy $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$**:  $9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n*   **Transition energy $\\Delta E$**: $4.087 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nThe ratio of these two energies is:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is extremely small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
