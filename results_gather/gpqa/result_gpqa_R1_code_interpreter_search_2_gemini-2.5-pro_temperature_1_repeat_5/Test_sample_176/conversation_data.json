    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2 ($L_1 / L_2$).\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Radius: $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$\n    *   Mass: $M_1 = 1.5 \\times M_2$ (This is likely extraneous information, as luminosity for a black body doesn't directly depend on mass in the primary formula).\n    *   Observed peak wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$. The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the peak wavelength as observed from Earth.\n    *   Radial velocity: $v_{r,1} = 0$ km/s.\n    *   Radial velocity: $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s. A positive radial velocity typically indicates the object is moving away from the observer.\n    *   Assumption: The stars radiate as black bodies.\n\n3.  **Select Relevant Physical Laws:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to its *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{emitted}$). The formula is $T = b / \\lambda_{emitted}$, where b is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect for Light:** This relates the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emitted}$) based on the radial velocity (v) of the source. For a source moving away, the formula is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v/c)$, where c is the speed of light.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    a.  Write down the expression for the ratio of luminosities ($L_1/L_2$) using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    b.  Use the information about the observed peak wavelengths and radial velocities, along with the Doppler effect, to find the relationship between the *emitted* peak wavelengths of the two stars.\n    c.  Use Wien's law to translate the relationship between emitted wavelengths into a relationship between the surface temperatures ($T_1/T_2$).\n    d.  Substitute the known radius ratio ($R_1/R_2$) and the calculated temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) into the luminosity ratio expression from step (a).\n    e.  Calculate the final numerical value.\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan:**\n    *   **Step a (Luminosity Ratio):**\n        $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n        $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n        Since $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, we have $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n        So, $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$.\n\n    *   **Step b (Relating Emitted Wavelengths):**\n        For Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$, so there is no Doppler shift. $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n        For Star_2: $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s. The light is redshifted. $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n        We are given $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n        Therefore, $\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\n    *   **Step c (Relating Temperatures):**\n        From Wien's Law, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emitted}$.\n        So, the ratio of temperatures is $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n        Substituting the result from Step b:\n        $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / [\\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)] = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\n    *   **Step d (Substituting into Luminosity Ratio):**\n        $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n        $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4$\n\n    *   **Step e (Calculation):**\n        I will now use a Python script to compute the final value with high precision.\n        - $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n        - $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$\n        The expression to compute is $2.25 \\times (1 + 700000 / 299792458)^{-4}$.\n\n```python\nv_r2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star 2 in m/s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# The ratio of luminosities is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# (R1/R2)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c)\n# So the final ratio is 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v_r2/c))^4\n\nluminosity_ratio = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v_r2 / c))**4\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.22910793167123\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.229.

    "The user wants to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Luminosity, Radius, and Temperature.**\nThe luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n$L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\nwhere:\n*   R is the star's radius.\n*   T is the star's surface temperature.\n*   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n**2. Formulate the ratio of luminosities.**\nWe want to find $L_1 / L_2$.\n$L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\nThe constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n**3. Use the given information about the radii.**\nWe are given that $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\nSubstituting this into the equation:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the temperatures, $T_1/T_2$.\n\n**4. Relate Temperature to Wavelength.**\nWien's Displacement Law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength at which it *emits* most of its light ($\\lambda_{emitted}$):\n$T = b / \\lambda_{emitted}$, where b is Wien's constant.\nThis means temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength: $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emitted}$.\nTherefore, the ratio of temperatures is:\n$T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1}$\n\n**5. Account for the Doppler Effect.**\nThe problem states that the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$), which can be affected by the star's motion relative to us (the Doppler effect).\nThe relationship between observed and emitted wavelength is:\n$\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} \\sqrt{(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)}$ or, for non-relativistic speeds, the approximation $\\lambda_{obs} \\approx \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity.\n\n*   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity is 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift.\n    $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,1}$\n*   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity is 700 km/s. The star is moving away, causing a redshift (observed wavelength is longer than emitted wavelength).\n    $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n**6. Find the relationship between the emitted wavelengths.**\nWe are given that $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\nTherefore:\n$\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n**7. Calculate the temperature ratio.**\nFrom step 4, we have $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\nUsing the relationship from step 6, we can find this ratio:\n$\\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\nSo, $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\n**8. Calculate the final luminosity ratio.**\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the equation from step 3:\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4$\nNow, we can plug in the values and compute the result.\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c$ (speed of light) = $299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nThe calculation is $2.25 / (1 + 700000 / 299792458)^4$.

    "The reasoning and steps to solve this problem are as follows:\n\n**1. Define the Luminosity Ratio**\nThe luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n$L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\nwhere R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2 is:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\nThis simplifies to:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n**2. Use the Given Radius Information**\nWe are given that $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so the ratio $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\nPlugging this into the equation:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n**3. Determine the Temperature Ratio**\nWien's Displacement Law relates the star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength at which it *emits* light ($\\lambda_{emitted}$):\n$T \\propto 1 / \\lambda_{emitted}$\nTherefore, the ratio of the temperatures is the inverse of the ratio of their emitted peak wavelengths:\n$T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1}$\n\n**4. Account for the Doppler Effect on Wavelength**\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. We must relate the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength using the Doppler effect formula for light, $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n*   **For Star_1:** $v_{r,1} = 0$. There is no Doppler shift. So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n*   **For Star_2:** $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s. The light is redshifted. So, $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\nSince we are given $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can set the expressions equal:\n$\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for the temperature calculation:\n$\\lambda_{emitted,2} / \\lambda_{emitted,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\nSubstituting this back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\n$T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nSubstitute the expression for the temperature ratio into the luminosity ratio equation from Step 2:\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4$\n\nNow, we insert the numerical values:\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 3.0 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nThe calculation performed by the code is:\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700000 / 300000000)^4$\nThe output `2.2291075611484996` confirms this calculation.\n\nThis value rounds to **2.23**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
