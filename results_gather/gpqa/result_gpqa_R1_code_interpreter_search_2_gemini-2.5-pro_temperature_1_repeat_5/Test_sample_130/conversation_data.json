    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Dienophile (the Anhydride)**\n\n1.  The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid yields an anhydride. A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is required to form a cyclic anhydride.\n2.  The simplest *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, commonly known as maleic acid.\n3.  Dehydration of maleic acid produces **maleic anhydride**.\n4.  Let's check if the provided NMR data for the anhydride matches maleic anhydride:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Maleic anhydride is a highly symmetrical molecule (C₂v symmetry). The two protons on the double bond are chemically and magnetically equivalent. Therefore, they appear as a single peak (a singlet). The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinyl protons that are part of a conjugated, electron-withdrawing system (alpha to two carbonyl groups). This matches the description \"a single peak (7 ppm)\".\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Due to symmetry, there are only two types of carbon atoms: the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This leads to two peaks in the ¹³C spectrum. An alkene carbon peak around 137 ppm and an anhydride carbonyl peak around 165 ppm are very reasonable values.\n5.  Conclusion: The anhydride used in the reaction is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Diene**\n\n1.  The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n2.  This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3, a CH₂ group at position 5, and methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and its Products**\n\n1.  The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a conjugated diene and a dienophile.\n2.  The reaction between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride will form a bicyclic adduct.\n3.  Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two major stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n4.  According to the **endo rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* isomer, which is formed faster (kinetically controlled). The *exo* isomer is usually more stable but forms more slowly, making it the minor product.\n5.  Therefore:\n    *   **Major product = *endo* adduct**\n    *   **Minor product = *exo* adduct**\n6.  The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify:\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) → Adduct (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This is correct.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemistry and Spatial Proximity of Protons**\n\nLet's draw and compare the structures of the *endo* and *exo* products to understand the key difference relevant to NOESY NMR. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n\n*   **Proton inventory of the product:**\n    *   Two bridgehead methyl groups (**Me_bh**, 6H total).\n    *   Two vinylic methyl groups (**Me_vinyl**, 6H total).\n    *   Two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**, 2H total).\n    *   Two diastereotopic protons on the methylene bridge (**H_bridge**, 2H total).\n\n*   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7-methylene bridge (*syn* orientation). This brings the **H_anhydride** protons very close in space to the **H_bridge** protons (specifically, the one pointing towards the anhydride).\n*   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C7-methylene bridge (*anti* orientation). In this configuration, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons.\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the NOESY Data**\n\n1.  NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n2.  The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum.\n3.  This distinguishing cross-peak must arise from the spatial proximity that exists *only* in the major (*endo*) product. Based on our analysis in Step 4, this is the interaction between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **H_bridge** protons.\n\n**Step 6: Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option**\n\nLet's predict the signals for the protons involved in the key NOE:\n\n*   **H_anhydride:** These are two equivalent protons (due to symmetry) on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. They will be deshielded. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is expected. They will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **H_bridge:** These are two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge. They are in a saturated, bicyclic environment and will be shielded. A chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm** is expected. Since they are non-equivalent and coupled to each other (geminal coupling), they will appear as two separate **1H doublets**.\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak unique to the major product connects the signal for **H_anhydride** with the signal for one of the **H_bridge** protons. This corresponds to a correlation between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: This is an NOE between Me_bh and Me_vinyl. This would likely be present in both isomers and is not the distinguishing feature.\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches our predicted NOE between one of the H_bridge protons and the H_anhydride protons. This interaction is unique to the major (*endo*) product.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This is an NOE between Me_vinyl and H_anhydride. In the *endo* product, these groups are on opposite faces of the molecule and thus far apart. This NOE is not expected.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: This is an NOE between Me_bh and H_bridge. This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak described must connect the resonances in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
