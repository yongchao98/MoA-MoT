    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Let's calculate the mass of [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass of Carbon (C) = 12 amu\n        *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 16 amu\n        *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1 amu\n        *   Total Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This fragmentation data provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the Chemical Formula Options**\n    *   Based on the spectral analysis, the compound must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This requirement immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with options B (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2).\n    *   Now, we must consider the degrees of unsaturation (DoU), which represents the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   Our molecule has one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, it must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula only allows for one degree of unsaturation. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it cannot have the additional C=C double bond required by the FTIR and NMR data.\n        *   **For D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accommodates one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n    The chemical formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the evidence: it contains two oxygen atoms (for the carboxylic acid), and it has two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carbonyl group and the alkene group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
