    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The core of the problem is to compare two scenarios that cause a dip in a star's observed brightness:\n    *   **Scenario 1 (Spots):** A star rotates, showing a hemisphere covered with dark spots, then an unspotted hemisphere. This causes a periodic change in brightness. We need to find the amplitude of this change.\n    *   **Scenario 2 (Exoplanet):** A hypothetical exoplanet transits (passes in front of) a perfectly uniform star, blocking some of its light.\n    *   The goal is to find the size of the exoplanet (relative to the star) that would produce the same brightness dip as the spots.\n\n2.  **Model the Brightness Variation due to Spots:**\n    *   The flux (F) from a surface is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (F ∝ T⁴).\n    *   Let's define the star's properties:\n        *   Effective Temperature (T_eff) = 6000 K\n        *   Spot Temperature (T_spot) = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n        *   Spot filling factor (f) on the spotted hemisphere = 20% = 0.20\n    *   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature of T_eff. The flux is proportional to `T_eff^4`.\n    *   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. The visible disk is a mix of the normal stellar surface and cooler spots.\n        *   A fraction `(1 - f)` of the disk is at T_eff.\n        *   A fraction `f` of the disk is at T_spot.\n        *   The total flux is the weighted average: F_min ∝ `(1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Spot Signal:**\n    *   The amplitude (A) of the signal is the relative drop in flux:\n        A = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n    *   Substituting the expressions for flux:\n        A = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4]\n    *   Simplifying the equation:\n        A = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4]\n        A = f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4\n        A = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]\n    *   Now, we plug in the numbers:\n        *   f = 0.20\n        *   T_spot = 5000 K\n        *   T_eff = 6000 K\n        *   (T_spot / T_eff) = 5000 / 6000 = 5/6\n        *   A = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)^4]\n\n4.  **Model the Brightness Dip due to an Exoplanet:**\n    *   During a transit, an exoplanet blocks a circular area of the star's disk.\n    *   The depth of the transit (the drop in brightness) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's disk area.\n        *   Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n    *   We want this transit depth to be equal to the amplitude `A` from the spots.\n        (R_pl / R_star)² = A\n\n5.  **Equate and Solve:**\n    *   (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)^4]\n    *   To solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star), we take the square root of the amplitude.\n        R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * [1 - (5/6)^4])\n    *   Let's perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Star and spot properties\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Spot temperature in Kelvin\nf = 0.20         # Spot filling factor\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots\n# A = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The transit depth for an exoplanet is (R_pl / R_star)**2\n# We set the amplitude equal to the transit depth to find the equivalent planet size.\n# (R_pl / R_star)**2 = amplitude\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"{relative_radius:.4f}\")\n```\n\nExecuting the code above yields:\n```\n0.3218\n```\n\nThe calculated relative radius (R_pl / R_star) is approximately 0.3218. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness dip as a star with a spotted hemisphere.\n\n**1. Calculate the Flux from the Star**\n\nThe flux (brightness) of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible surface is at the effective temperature (T_eff).\n    *   F_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere's surface is a mix of the normal star surface and cooler spots.\n    *   Area of spots = 20% = 0.20\n    *   Area of normal surface on this hemisphere = 80% = 0.80\n    *   The flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average:\n        F_min ∝ (0.80 * T_eff⁴) + (0.20 * T_spot⁴)\n\n**2. Calculate the Amplitude of the Variation due to Spots**\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional drop in flux.\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n\nSubstituting the flux expressions (the proportionality constant cancels out):\nAmplitude = 1 - [((0.80 * T_eff⁴) + (0.20 * T_spot⁴)) / T_eff⁴]\nAmplitude = 1 - [0.80 + 0.20 * (T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴)]\nAmplitude = 1 - 0.80 - 0.20 * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\nAmplitude = 0.20 - 0.20 * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Filling factor (f) = 0.20\n\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]\nAmplitude = 0.20 * 0.51775\nAmplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\n**3. Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Size**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits a star, the drop in brightness (the transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\nTransit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\nTransit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nWe want this transit depth to be equal to the amplitude from the spots.\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\nTo find the relative radius, we take the square root:\nR_pl / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10355)\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is closest to 0.32.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The calculation `0.3218` is robust and directly answers the question. It matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
