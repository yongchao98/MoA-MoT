    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Analyze the two Mean Free Paths (MFPs)**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules *before* the electron beam is turned on. The collisions governing this MFP are between gas molecules themselves. The formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule in a gas of identical molecules is given by:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)\n        where `n` is the number density of the gas molecules and `σ_gas` is the kinetic collision cross-section for two gas molecules (related to their physical size). In an ultra-high vacuum (UHV), `n` is very small, so λ1 is very large (often limited by the size of the vacuum chamber itself, which can be meters long, while the calculated MFP can be kilometers).\n\n    *   **λ2:** This is the new mean free path observed *after* the electron beam is turned on. The problem states this observation is \"based on electron scattering with the gas molecules.\" This phrasing points to a new physical phenomenon altering the conditions in the chamber.\n\n2.  **Consider the Effect of the Electron Beam**\n    *   The electron beam consists of high-energy electrons (1000 keV = 1 MeV). As these electrons travel through the residual gas, they will collide with the gas molecules.\n    *   These are not simple billiard-ball collisions. The high energy is more than sufficient to ionize the gas molecules (i.e., knock an electron off the molecule).\n    *   The process looks like: e⁻ (fast) + M (neutral) → e⁻ (fast) + M⁺ (ion) + e⁻ (slow secondary).\n    *   As a result, the initially neutral gas in the sample compartment becomes a tenuous **plasma**, a mixture of neutral molecules (M), positive ions (M⁺), and electrons (the beam electrons and secondary electrons).\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Physics in the Two Scenarios**\n    *   **Scenario for λ1:** The gas is composed entirely of neutral molecules. The forces between them are very short-range (van der Waals forces). Particles have to get very close to each other to collide. This results in a relatively small collision cross-section, `σ_gas`.\n    *   **Scenario for λ2:** The gas is now a plasma containing charged particles (ions). The force between charged particles is the **long-range Coulomb force**. An ion can influence another ion (or a neutral molecule via polarization) from a much greater distance than two neutral molecules can influence each other.\n    *   This long-range interaction dramatically increases the effective collision cross-section for particles within the gas. Any given particle (ion or neutral) is much more likely to have its path significantly deflected by an interaction.\n\n4.  **Relate Cross-Section to Mean Free Path**\n    *   The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ): λ ∝ 1/σ.\n    *   In the second scenario (with the beam on), the effective collision cross-section for the particles in the chamber (`σ_effective_plasma`) is much larger than the original kinetic cross-section for the neutral gas (`σ_gas`).\n        σ_effective_plasma > σ_gas\n    *   Because the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section, the new mean free path (λ2) must be smaller than the original one (λ1).\n        λ2 < λ1\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1  (Incorrect, suggests λ2 is larger)\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect, the electron beam has a significant physical effect)\n    *   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, suggests λ2 is larger)\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1 (Correct, matches our physical reasoning)\n\n*Alternative Interpretation Note:* One might misinterpret λ2 as the mean free path *of the beam electrons*. A high-energy electron has a very small scattering cross-section, which would imply a very long MFP for the electron (λ_electron >> λ1). However, the phrasing \"intriguing observation\" and the context of monitoring the gas environment (with a mass spectrometer) strongly suggests that λ2 refers to the new, altered state of the gas itself, not the MFP of the beam electrons. The creation of a plasma from a neutral gas by a beam is a significant and interesting phenomenon.\n\n<<<D>>>"
