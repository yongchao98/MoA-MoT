    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics Model\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy levels of such a system are given by the formula:\n`E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B*J(J+1)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`h / 2π`).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as `B = ħ² / (2I)`, where `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\nThe model mentioned is the \"non-rigid rotor,\" which includes a centrifugal distortion term `-D*J²(J+1)²`. However, this term is typically very small and can be neglected unless high precision is required. We will proceed without it and can verify its negligible effect later if needed.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    `E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω`\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This phrasing requires careful interpretation.\n    *   The given angular frequency `ω = 4 * 10^14 rad/s` corresponds to an energy in the infrared region, which is characteristic of vibrational transitions.\n    *   For an absorption of an infrared photon, the selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n    *   Starting from `J = 0`, the only possible change for `J` is `ΔJ = +1` (since `J` cannot be negative).\n    *   Therefore, the transition must be from `v = 0` to `v = 1` and from `J = 0` to `J = 1`.\n    *   **Final State:** `v = 1`, `J = 1`.\n    `E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B*1*(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Photon Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the difference in energy between the final and initial states.\n`ΔE = E_final - E_initial`\n`ΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]`\n`ΔE = ħω + 2B`\n\nTo find `ΔE`, we need to calculate `ħω` and the rotational constant `B`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Physical Parameters\n\nWe will now compute the necessary values using a Python script. The steps are:\n1.  Calculate the reduced mass (`μ`) of the molecule.\n2.  Calculate the moment of inertia (`I = μR²`).\n3.  Calculate the rotational constant (`B = ħ² / 2I`).\n4.  Calculate the total transition energy (`ΔE = ħω + 2B`).\n5.  Finally, calculate the photon's momentum using the energy-momentum relation `p = ΔE / c`.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# Given values\nMx_amu = 20.0  # mass of atom X in amu\nMy_amu = 2.0   # mass of atom Y in amu\nR = 2.0e-10    # bond length in meters\nw = 4.0e14     # angular frequency in rad/s\n\n# Physical constants\namu_to_kg = const.physical_constants['atomic mass constant'][0]\nh_bar = const.hbar  # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\nc = const.c         # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1. Calculate reduced mass (mu) in kg\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nmu = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)\n\n# 2. Calculate moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu * R**2\n\n# 3. Calculate rotational constant (B) in Joules\nB = h_bar**2 / (2 * I)\n\n# 4. Calculate the vibrational and rotational energy components\nE_vib = h_bar * w\nE_rot = 2 * B\n\n# 5. Calculate the total transition energy (Delta_E)\nDelta_E = E_vib + E_rot\n\n# 6. Calculate the photon momentum (p)\np = Delta_E / c\n\nprint(f\"Transition Energy (Delta_E): {Delta_E:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Photon Momentum (p): {p:.4e} N*s\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nTransition Energy (Delta_E): 4.2275e-20 J\nPhoton Momentum (p): 1.4101e-28 N*s\n</execute_code>\n\n### 5. Final Answer\n\nThe calculation shows that the energy of the absorbed photon is `ΔE ≈ 4.2275 * 10^-20 J`.\nThe corresponding momentum of the photon is `p = ΔE / c ≈ 1.4101 * 10^-28 N*s`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) p = 1.9 * 10^(-28) N*s\nB) p = 2.3 * 10^(-27) N*s\nC) p = 1.1 * 10^(-27) N*s\nD) p = 1.4 * 10^(-28) N*s\n\nThe calculated value `p ≈ 1.4 * 10^-28 N*s` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
