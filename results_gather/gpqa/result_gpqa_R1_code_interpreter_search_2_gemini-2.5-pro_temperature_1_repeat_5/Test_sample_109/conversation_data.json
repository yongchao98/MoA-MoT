    "Both ESPRESSO at the Paranal Observatory and HIRES at the Keck Observatory have specific limitations on which stars they can observe. The two main constraints are the star's position in the sky (declination) and its brightness (apparent magnitude).\n\n**1. Observability based on Location (Declination)**\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees (Southern Hemisphere). Stars visible from this location must have a declination (DEC) greater than -24.6 - 90 = -114.6 degrees. Since declination is capped at -90, practically any star in the southern celestial hemisphere and a significant portion of the northern celestial hemisphere is accessible. A common rule of thumb for good observations is that the star's declination should be less than about +30 to +45 degrees to achieve a reasonable altitude in the sky.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at a latitude of approximately +19.8 degrees (Northern Hemisphere). Stars visible from this location must have a declination greater than +19.8 - 90 = -70.2 degrees. For high-quality observations, the star's declination should ideally be greater than about -30 to -40 degrees.\n\nFor a star to be observed by **both** observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range. Conservatively, this means the declination must be greater than -70.2° and less than about +30°.\n\n**2. Observability based on Brightness (Apparent Magnitude)**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO:** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 (V < 17).\n*   **HIRES:** Can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag (V < 16).\n\nTo be observed by **both**, a star must satisfy the stricter condition, which is **V < 16 mag**.\n\n**3. Calculating Apparent V Magnitude (V)**\n\nThe apparent magnitude (V) is what we observe from Earth. It is related to the absolute magnitude (M_V) by the distance modulus formula, which also accounts for interstellar extinction (A_V):\nV = M_V - 5 + 5 * log10(d) + A_V\nwhere 'd' is the distance in parsecs (pc) and A_V is the extinction. Extinction is calculated as A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). If there is no extinction, A_V = 0.\n\n---\n**Analyzing the Stars:**\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **DEC = -75°:** This is too far south for Keck Observatory (DEC < -70.2°).\n    *   *Conclusion: Not observable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **DEC = +55°:** This is too far north for good observations from Paranal.\n    *   **V = 16.5 mag:** This is too faint for HIRES (V > 16).\n    *   *Conclusion: Not observable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **DEC = +48°:** This is too far north for good observations from Paranal.\n    *   Let's check the brightness anyway:\n        *   V = 15.5 mag\n        *   This is bright enough for both (V < 16).\n    *   *Conclusion: Not observable by both due to declination.*\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **DEC = -48°:** This declination is comfortably observable from both Paranal (-24.6°) and Keck (+19.8°).\n    *   **Brightness (V):**\n        *   M_V = 15.5 mag\n        *   d = 10 pc\n        *   A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n        *   V = 15.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) + 1.24 = 15.5 - 5 + 5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**\n        *   This is too faint for HIRES (V > 16).\n    *   *Conclusion: Not observable by both due to faintness.*\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **DEC = +60°:** This is too far north for good observations from Paranal.\n    *   **Brightness (V):**\n        *   M_V = 16.5 mag\n        *   d = 5 pc\n        *   A_V = 0 (no extinction mentioned)\n        *   V = 16.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) = 11.5 + 5 * 0.699 = 11.5 + 3.495 = **14.995 mag**\n        *   This is bright enough for both (V < 16).\n    *   *Conclusion: Not observable by both due to declination.*\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, none of the listed stars can be detected by both spectrographs. The provided options are likely based on a flawed premise or a miscalculation. However, if forced to choose based on the provided options and assuming there might be an error in the problem's data (for instance, if Star 4 had no extinction, its V would be 15.5, making it observable by both in terms of magnitude and location), we re-evaluate. But sticking strictly to the data given, no star satisfies all conditions. There seems to be an issue with the question or the options provided.\n\nLet's re-examine the calculations and conditions. The declination limits are the most rigid constraints.\n- Star 1 (DEC -75°): Fails Keck.\n- Star 2 (DEC +55°): Fails Paranal.\n- Star 3 (DEC +48°): Fails Paranal.\n- Star 4 (DEC -48°): Observable from both locations. Brightness V=16.74, fails HIRES.\n- Star 5 (DEC +60°): Fails Paranal.\n\nThere is no star that meets both the declination and brightness criteria for both observatories. This implies an error in the question's construction.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the brightness calculation for Star 4, and it was intended to be observable. If we ignore the extinction for Star 4, V = 15.5, which is < 16, and its declination of -48° is fine for both. If we assume there's a typo in the declination for Star 3, making it observable, its brightness V=15.5 is also fine. Without such assumptions, none of the pairs work. Given the format of the question, there is likely an intended answer. The most common error is forgetting to include extinction in magnitude calculations. If the calculation for Star 4 was done incorrectly by the question provider (e.g., they forgot extinction), it would appear as V=15.5 and DEC=-48, making it a viable candidate. However, as calculated, it is not. Since no star combination works, there is no correct answer among the options.\n\n<<<No correct answer based on the data provided. There is a contradiction in the problem statement as none of the stars satisfy the conditions for observation from both facilities.>>>"
