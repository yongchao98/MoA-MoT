    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis\n\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as a base.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base.\n    *   This setup is characteristic of a **Michael addition reaction**. The ketone, after deprotonation, will act as the Michael donor (nucleophile), and the ethyl acrylate will act as the Michael acceptor (electrophile).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Michael Donor):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) removes an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate ion.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n        *   **C2** is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, in addition to C1 and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6** is bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen atom, in addition to C1 and C5. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6. The bulky base t-BuOK removes the proton from C6 to form the thermodynamic/kinetic enolate (in this case, they are the same as it's the only option).\n\n      (Conceptual representation)\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate, which is nucleophilic at C6, attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Subsequent protonation (e.g., from t-butanol formed during enolate formation or during workup) neutralizes the intermediate enolate formed from the acrylate, yielding the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has a -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group attached to C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   Let's determine the IUPAC name of the product. The ester is the principal functional group.\n        *   The main chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n        *   The large cyclohexanone group is a substituent on carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n        *   To name the substituent, we number the cyclohexyl ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6) as C1'.\n            *   Attachment point (C1') has a methyl group. -> **1-methyl**\n            *   The carbonyl group is at C2'. -> **2-oxo**\n            *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) is now at C3'. -> **3-ethyl, 3-methyl**\n        *   The full name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Combining everything, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis\n\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂) is a nitroalkane.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base.\n    *   This is another **Michael addition reaction**. The nitroalkane, after deprotonation, acts as the Michael donor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Carbanion (Michael Donor):**\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂) acidic.\n    *   KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion), [CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile. In but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), the β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond is formed between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Protonation by water (H₂O) in the reaction mixture gives the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is: **CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN**\n    *   Let's determine the IUPAC name. The nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group.\n        *   The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n        *   The longest carbon chain including C1 has 6 carbons. So the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   We number the chain to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n            *   C1: -CN\n            *   C2: -CH₂-\n            *   C3: -CH(CH₃)- (a methyl group at C3)\n            *   C4: -CH(NO₂)- (a nitro group at C4)\n            *   C5: -CH₂-\n            *   C6: -CH₃\n        *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   The full name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (B is incorrect)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (A is incorrect)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Both A and B are incorrect)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Both A and B are correct**)\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
