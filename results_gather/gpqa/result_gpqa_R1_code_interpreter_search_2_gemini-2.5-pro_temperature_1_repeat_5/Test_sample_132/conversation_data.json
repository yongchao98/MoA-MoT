    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Chemical System**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the chemical species present in the solution.\n*   We dissolve solid KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O in water.\n*   KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ (a spectator ion) and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely into 2Na+ (spectator ions), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion), and water.\n*   The key species are H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which form a conjugate acid-base pair. This means the solution is a buffer.\n\nThe relevant equilibria for the phosphate system are:\n1.  H3PO4  <=>  H+ + H2PO4-      (Ka1 = 7.5 x 10^-3)\n2.  H2PO4-  <=>  H+ + HPO4^2-      (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8)\n3.  HPO4^2-  <=>  H+ + PO4^3-      (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12)\n\nOur solution contains a mixture of H2PO4- (the acid in equilibrium 2) and HPO4^2- (the base in equilibrium 2). This buffer system will establish a specific pH governed by the Ka2 equilibrium. The concentration of orthophosphate (PO4^3-) will then be determined by the third equilibrium (Ka3) at that specific pH.\n\n### **2. Calculate Initial Moles and Concentrations**\n\nWe need to find the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components, H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n\n*   **Volume of solution:** V = 200.00 cm³ = 200.00 mL = 0.20000 L\n*   **Molar mass of KH2PO4:** Mw = 136.09 g/mol\n*   **Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O:** Mw = 177.99 g/mol\n\n*   **Moles of H2PO4- (from KH2PO4):**\n    n(H2PO4-) = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n\n*   **Moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4●2H2O):**\n    n(HPO4^2-) = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\n*   **Initial concentration of H2PO4-:**\n    [H2PO4-] = n / V = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Initial concentration of HPO4^2-:**\n    [HPO4^2-] = n / V = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n### **3. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**\n\nThe pH (and thus [H+]) of the buffer is controlled by the second dissociation equilibrium:\nH2PO4-  <=>  H+ + HPO4^2-\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n\nSince the dissociation and hydrolysis of the buffer components are minimal, we can use their initial concentrations as a very good approximation for their equilibrium concentrations.\n\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.115 x 10^-8 M\n\n### **4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-]**\n\nThe concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-, is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium:\nHPO4^2-  <=>  H+ + PO4^3-\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n\nNow, we plug in the values we have:\n*   Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12\n*   [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02809 M (the initial concentration)\n*   [H+] ≈ 8.115 x 10^-8 M (calculated from the buffer)\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 / 8.115 x 10^-8) ≈ 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\n### **5. Final Check and Code Verification**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can perform the calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations of buffer components\nconc_H2PO4_minus = (mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4) / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = (mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O) / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-]  =>  [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]  =>  [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nPO4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{PO4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.24e-07\n\nThe calculated result is 6.236 x 10^-7 M, which rounds to 6.24 x 10^-7 M. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
