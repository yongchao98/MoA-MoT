    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   Several functional groups are present: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO, also called formyl), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among these.\n*   Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n**2. Place the Substituents on the Benzene Ring**\n\nLet's place the groups based on the description relative to C1:\n\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** at **C1**.\n*   **Methoxy group (-OCH3):** \"para to the carboxylic acid\". Para means position 4. So, methoxy is at **C4**.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2):** \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid\". Ortho means positions 2 and 6. So, one of these groups is at C2 and the other is at C6.\n*   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO) and Cyano (-CN):** \"all meta to one another\" (referring to COOH, CHO, and CN). Meta means positions 3 and 5. So, one of these groups is at C3 and the other is at C5.\n\n**3. Use the Final Clue to Determine the Exact Positions**\n\nThe final clue is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n\n*   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group) must be at either C3 or C5.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must be at either C2 or C6.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Possibility A: Cyano group is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The clue states that methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl are ortho to the cyano group.\n    *   This requires the hydroxyl group to be at **C2**. This fits our constraints.\n    *   If hydroxyl is at C2, then dimethylamino must be at the other ortho position, **C6**.\n    *   If cyano is at C3, then the carbaldehyde (formyl) group must be at the other meta position, **C5**.\n\n*   **Possibility B: Cyano group is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The clue states that methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl are ortho to the cyano group.\n    *   This requires the hydroxyl group to be at **C6**. This also fits our constraints.\n    *   If hydroxyl is at C6, then dimethylamino must be at **C2**.\n    *   If cyano is at C5, then the carbaldehyde (formyl) group must be at **C3**.\n\nSo, we have two possible structures that fit the description.\n\n*   **Structure A:** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2\n*   **Structure B:** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\nWe need to name the substituents and list them alphabetically.\nThe substituents are: **cyano**, **dimethylamino**, **formyl**, **hydroxy**, **methoxy**.\n\nNow, we number the ring. Since C1 is fixed, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to the substituents. Both Structure A and Structure B use the same set of locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nWhen two different numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, IUPAC rules state that we must **give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order**.\n\n1.  The first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**.\n2.  In **Structure A**, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n3.  In **Structure B**, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, we must choose the numbering scheme from **Structure A**.\n\n**5. Construct the Final Name**\n\nUsing the positions from Structure A, we list the substituents alphabetically:\n\n*   **c**yano is at C3 -> **3-cyano**\n*   **d**imethylamino is at C6 -> **6-(dimethylamino)**\n*   **f**ormyl is at C5 -> **5-formyl**\n*   **h**ydroxy is at C2 -> **2-hydroxy**\n*   **m**ethoxy is at C4 -> **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order before the parent name \"benzoic acid\" gives:\n\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
