The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no CO₂ or other acidic gases were produced during the decomposition. This rules out salts like carbonates or oxalates.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n        *   The source of oxygen could be O₂ gas (O₂ + 2Cu → 2CuO) or other oxidizing gases like N₂O (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO).\n        *   The mass increase is purely the mass of oxygen atoms.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of gas C at STP remained.\n        *   Moles of C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   This gas passed through all tubes, including the hot copper, without being absorbed. This gas must be very unreactive, with N₂ being the most likely candidate.\n\n2.  **Determine the gaseous products before Tube №3:**\n    *   The decomposition produced H₂O, and gases that react with or pass through hot copper.\n    *   The elements present in the products are H (from H₂O), O (from H₂O and the 0.80g in tube 3), and N (from the final gas C, N₂). Thus, the original salts must contain N, H, and O.\n    *   Since they are salts, a common cation containing N and H is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and common anions containing N and O are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's hypothesize that the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n3.  **Test the hypothesis with the proposed salts:**\n    *   Let A be NH₄NO₃ and B be NH₄NO₂. The problem states the mixture is equimolar, so we have 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B.\n    *   The thermal decomposition reactions at ~200°C are:\n        *   **A:** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   **B:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   From 'n' moles of each salt, the total products are:\n        *   Total H₂O = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = **4n** mol.\n        *   Total N₂O = **n** mol.\n        *   Total N₂ = **n** mol.\n        *   No O₂ is produced in these standard decompositions.\n\n4.  **Relate the products to the experimental data:**\n    *   The gas mixture entering Tube №3 consists of `n` moles of N₂O and `n` moles of N₂ (the H₂O having been removed).\n    *   **In Tube №3 (hot Cu):**\n        *   N₂O reacts: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. One mole of N₂O delivers one mole of O atoms to the copper.\n        *   N₂ does not react.\n        *   The moles of O atoms absorbed by copper is equal to the moles of N₂O.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = `n` = 0.05 mol (from step 1). So, `n = 0.05`.\n    *   **Gas C (after Tube №3):**\n        *   The final gas is all the N₂. This includes the initial `n` moles of N₂ plus the `n` moles of N₂ produced from the N₂O decomposition.\n        *   Total moles of N₂ = `n` (initial) + `n` (from N₂O) = 2n.\n        *   From the data, moles of Gas C = 0.1 mol. So, 2n = 0.1 mol, which gives `n = 0.05`.\n    *   **Water (Tube №1):**\n        *   Total H₂O produced is 4n.\n        *   Using n = 0.05, moles of H₂O = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol. This matches our calculation from step 1.\n    *   The value `n = 0.05` is consistent with all parts of the experiment.\n\n5.  **Verify the initial mass:**\n    *   We have an equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n    *   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol)\n    *   Total Mass = 0.05 × (80.04 + 64.04) = 0.05 × 144.08 = 7.204 g.\n    *   This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g. The hypothesis is confirmed.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nTo be certain of all calculations, we can use a script.\n```python\n# --- Step 1: Analyze the products ---\n# Mass of H2O absorbed by tube 1\nmass_h2o = 3.60  # g\n# Molar mass of H2O (H:1.008, O:16.00)\nM_h2o = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00\n# Moles of H2O\nmoles_h2o = mass_h2o / M_h2o\n\n# Mass increase of tube 3 is the mass of Oxygen atoms\nmass_o_tube3 = 0.80  # g\n# Molar mass of O\nM_o = 16.00\n# Moles of O atoms absorbed by Cu\nmoles_o_tube3 = mass_o_tube3 / M_o\n\n# Volume of remaining gas C at STP\nvol_c = 2.24  # L\n# Molar volume at STP\nvol_molar_stp = 22.4  # L/mol\n# Moles of gas C (which is N2)\nmoles_c_n2 = vol_c / vol_molar_stp\n\n# --- Step 2: Propose salts and solve for 'n' ---\n# From Tube 3, moles of O atoms = moles of N2O = 0.05 mol. So, n = 0.05.\n# From final gas C, total moles of N2 = 2n = 0.1 mol. So, n = 0.05.\n# From Tube 1, total moles of H2O = 4n = 0.2 mol.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of each tube and the data obtained:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent (desiccant). It absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced by the decomposition.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ (which would form a CaCO₃ precipitate). The fact that the weight did not change means no such acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts like carbonates, oxalates, or sulfites that would produce CO₂, CO, or SO₂.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂) or nitrogen oxides like nitrous oxide (N₂O). The problem states CuO is formed. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a gas (at STP) remains.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   This gas is inert to water, limewater, and hot copper. The most common and logical candidate for such a gas in this context is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Deduce the composition of the original salts:**\n    *   The products identified are H₂O, N₂, and a gas that provides 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. The elements present in the products are Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Since the original compounds are salts, and they contain N, H, and O, a very likely candidate for the cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and for the anions are oxygen-containing nitrogen anions like nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n\n3.  **Formulate a hypothesis for the salts and their decomposition:**\n    *   Let's assume the two salts (A and B) are **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n    *   The thermal decomposition reactions are well-known:\n        *   **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n        *   **NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n    *   The problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. Let's say there are 'n' moles of each salt.\n\n4.  **Test the hypothesis against the experimental data:**\n    *   According to the reactions, from 'n' moles of each salt, the products are:\n        *   From NH₄NO₂: n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n        *   From NH₄NO₃: n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n    *   **Total Products:** n mol N₂, n mol N₂O, and 4n mol H₂O.\n    *   **Tube №1 (H₂O):** Total moles of H₂O = 4n. From our data, this is 0.2 mol. So, 4n = 0.2 mol ⇒ **n = 0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №3 (hot Cu):** The gases entering this tube are N₂ and N₂O (H₂O was removed). N₂ is inert, but N₂O reacts: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n        *   This reaction shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = Moles of N₂O = n.\n        *   From our data, moles of O atoms = 0.05 mol. So, **n = 0.05 mol**. This is consistent.\n    *   **Gas C (N₂):** The final gas is the total N₂. This includes the N₂ produced directly from NH₄NO₂ and the N₂ produced from the reduction of N₂O in tube №3.\n        *   Total N₂ = (n mol from NH₄NO₂) + (n mol from N₂O) = 2n.\n        *   From our data, moles of final gas = 0.1 mol. So, 2n = 0.1 mol ⇒ **n = 0.05 mol**. This is also consistent.\n\n5.  **Verify the initial mass:**\n    *   Since n = 0.05 mol, we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 80.05 g/mol.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) = 64.05 g/mol.\n    *   Total Mass = 0.05 mol × (80.05 g/mol + 64.05 g/mol) = 0.05 mol × 144.1 g/mol = 7.205 g.\n    *   This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g. The hypothesis is correct.\n\n6.  **Calculate the total number of atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   Salt A (NH₄NO₃): Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n    *   Salt B (NH₄NO₂): Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms in both salts = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
