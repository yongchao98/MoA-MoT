    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   Butan-2-one is a ketone (CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   Sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a source of the cyanide nucleophile (⁻CN).\n*   **Product:**\n    *   2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's determine its structure. The main chain is butanenitrile, which is a 4-carbon chain with a nitrile group (-CN). The numbering starts from the nitrile carbon, but in this case, it's an IUPAC name based on the longest chain *including* the functional group. The name implies a butane chain where a nitrile and a hydroxyl group are attached. A more systematic name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure is CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group. The cyanide ion (⁻CN) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms a C-C single bond, leaving a negatively charged oxygen (an alkoxide intermediate).\n    *   CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃ + ⁻CN → CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃\n*   **Role of Reagent A:** The alkoxide intermediate is a base. It needs to be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin product. Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n    *   CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃\n*   **Evaluating Options for A:**\n    *   H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion) represents an acidic aqueous solution. It is an excellent source of protons.\n    *   NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite) is used in a different type of addition reaction with aldehydes and some ketones to form crystalline addition products for purification. It is not used to provide a proton in this context.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be a proton source, so H₃O⁺ is the correct choice. This narrows the options down to A and D.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   The starting material is a nitrile (specifically, a cyanohydrin, which contains a -CN group).\n*   **Product:**\n    *   The product is a carboxylic acid. The nitrile group (-CN) has been converted to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile. Nitrile hydrolysis requires either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, usually with heating.\n    *   R-CN + 2 H₂O → R-COOH + NH₃\n*   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B, along with water, acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n*   **Evaluating Options for B:**\n    *   CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it can protonate things, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid. This reaction typically requires harsh conditions.\n    *   HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and effective catalyst for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles. The reaction proceeds by protonating the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B must be a strong acid catalyst for the hydrolysis. HCl is the correct choice.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results and select the final answer.**\n\n*   From Step 1, we concluded that **A = H₃O⁺**.\n*   From Step 2, we concluded that **B = HCl**.\n*   Matching these conclusions with the given options:\n    *   A) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect)\n    *   B) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl (Incorrect)\n    *   C) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect)\n    *   D) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl (Correct)\n\nTherefore, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<D>>>"
