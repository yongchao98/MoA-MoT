    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5, which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. The chiral center is C5.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. Since the starting material is achiral at C3, the hydride anion (H‚Åª) from LAH can attack the carbonyl carbon from either the top face or the bottom face. This results in the formation of both (R) and (S) configurations at the new chiral center, C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:**\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction, so its configuration remains (S).\n    *   The two products formed are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   These two molecules have one chiral center in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:**\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH4) are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry (it is superimposable on its mirror image, the (2S, 4R) form). Therefore, this is a **meso compound**. It is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. The stationary phase is achiral.\n*   **Separation of Enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (same polarity, boiling point, etc.). Therefore, they **cannot** be separated by normal-phase HPLC and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Separation of Diastereomers:** Diastereomers (including meso compounds relative to their chiral isomers) have different physical properties and different polarities. They **can** be separated by normal-phase HPLC.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:**\n    1.  The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The three products from Reaction II consist of a racemic pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the chiral isomers. It will have a different polarity and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. This gives a second, distinct **1 peak**.\n        *   Thus, the products of Reaction II give a total of **2 peaks**.\n    3.  The products from Reaction I (C7 alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols), so their peaks will be distinct from one another.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** Chiral HPLC is designed to separate all unique stereoisomers. We have a total of 5 unique stereoisomeric compounds in our final mixture.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (**Peak 1**)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (**Peak 2**)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (**Peak 3**)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (**Peak 4**)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (**Peak 5**)\n*   Since all five compounds are stereochemically distinct, and a chiral column can resolve them all (including the enantiomers from Reaction II), we expect to see five separate peaks.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
