    "*   **Analyze the Question:** The question asks to identify the physical theory among the given options that does not require \"regularization at high energies.\"\n\n*   **Define Regularization:** Regularization is a technique used in physics, particularly in quantum field theory (QFT), to handle infinities that arise in calculations. These infinities typically emerge when considering interactions at very high energies (or, equivalently, at very short distances), a regime often called the \"ultraviolet\" (UV) regime. The need for regularization indicates a breakdown of the theory at these high energy scales. After regularization, a process called renormalization is often used to make the theory predictive.\n\n*   **Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory describes the interactions of electric charges and currents. While it is a classical theory, it suffers from its own high-energy problem. If one considers an electron as a point particle (with zero radius), its electrostatic self-energy becomes infinite. To get a finite answer, one must \"regularize\" the theory, for instance, by assuming the electron has a small but non-zero radius. Therefore, Classical Electrodynamics does face a problem at short distances (high energies) that requires a form of regularization.\n\n    *   **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. When calculating physical quantities like the self-energy of an electron or scattering amplitudes, loop diagrams lead to divergent integrals. These are the ultraviolet (UV) divergences that arise from integrating over all possible high momentum (high energy) states of virtual particles in the loops. QED is a prime example of a theory where regularization (e.g., using a momentum cutoff or dimensional regularization) followed by renormalization is essential to make finite, accurate predictions.\n\n    *   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force. Similar to QED, QCD is a quantum field theory based on point particles (quarks and gluons). Calculations involving loop diagrams in QCD also lead to ultraviolet divergences that must be treated with regularization and renormalization.\n\n    *   **B) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity and a unified theory of all forces. Its fundamental premise is that elementary particles are not point-like objects but rather tiny, one-dimensional vibrating \"strings.\" A key feature and motivation for string theory is that it naturally resolves the high-energy (UV) divergences that plague quantum field theories. The interactions between strings are not point-like but are \"smeared out\" in spacetime. This smearing effect smooths out the interactions at short distances, causing the loop integrals in the theory to be finite. Because these calculations yield finite results without any ad-hoc procedure, string theory is believed to be a UV-finite theory that does not require regularization.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** QED, QCD, and even Classical Electrodynamics all encounter infinities associated with high-energy/short-distance behavior, necessitating regularization. Superstring Theory, by its very construction (replacing point particles with extended strings), avoids these infinities and is thus considered a UV-finite theory that does not require regularization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
