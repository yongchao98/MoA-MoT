    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Name:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Core Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The epoxide oxygen is atom 7, and it bridges carbons 1 and 6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups on C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The name provides the absolute configuration at the four stereocenters: C1 is R, C3 is R, C4 is R, and C6 is S. This defines a single, specific stereoisomer. For the reaction, we don't need to draw the exact 3D chair conformation, as long as we keep track of the given configurations.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The epoxide is reacted with `Me2CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate), which is a Gilman reagent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The nucleophile is the methyl group (`Me-`) from the cuprate.\n*   **Key Principles for Cuprate Opening of Epoxides:**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2-type mechanism**. This means the nucleophile performs a \"backside attack,\" approaching from the face opposite to the C-O bond being broken. This results in **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Apply the Principles to the Specific Reaction**\n\n*   **Step 3a: Identify the site of attack (Regioselectivity).**\n    *   The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a **tertiary** carbon.\n    *   C6 has only a hydrogen atom attached (besides the ring carbons), making it a **secondary** carbon.\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**, and the methyl nucleophile from Me2CuLi will attack C6.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Determine the stereochemical outcome (Stereoselectivity).**\n    *   The methyl nucleophile attacks C6 and breaks the C6-O bond.\n    *   The attack causes an **inversion of configuration** at C6. The starting configuration of C6 is given as **(S)**. Inversion will change it to **(R)**.\n    *   The other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps. Their configurations will be retained.\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide breaks its connection to C6 but remains attached to C1. After an aqueous workup step (which is implicit in such problems), the oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereocenter at C1 is not inverted.\n\n*   **Step 3c: Assemble the product's structure and name.**\n    *   The reaction opens the bicyclic epoxide to form a single-ring substituted cyclohexanol.\n    *   The -OH group is on C1.\n    *   There are methyl groups at the original positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   A new methyl group has been added at C6.\n    *   The product is a **tetramethylcyclohexanol**.\n\n*   **Step 3d: Determine the IUPAC name and stereochemistry of the product.**\n    *   **Numbering:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is numbered C1. We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n        *   New C1 = Old C1 (has OH and Me).\n        *   The next substituent is on Old C6. To get the lowest locant set, we number in that direction. So, New C2 = Old C6.\n        *   Continuing around the ring: New C3 = Old C5; New C4 = Old C4; New C5 = Old C3; New C6 = Old C2.\n        *   The methyl groups are located at New C1 (original), New C2 (from cuprate), New C4 (original), and New C5 (original).\n        *   The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** We track the configuration of each stereocenter from the starting material to the product using the new numbering.\n        *   **New C1** (from Old C1): Retains its configuration. Was (R) -> Remains **(R)**.\n        *   **New C2** (from Old C6): Undergoes inversion. Was (S) -> Becomes **(R)**.\n        *   **New C4** (from Old C4): Retains its configuration. Was (R) -> Remains **(R)**.\n        *   **New C5** (from Old C3): Retains its configuration. Was (R) -> Remains **(R)**.\n\n    *   **Final Product Name:** Putting it all together, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare with the Options**\n    *   Our derived product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n    *   This matches option B exactly.\n\n    *   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect locants)\n    *   B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Correct)\n    *   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect locants and stereochemistry)\n    *   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect stereochemistry at C2)\n\n<<<B>>>"
