    "*   **Step 1: Decipher the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for the O-H bond of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very deshielded, broad singlet is indicative of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (the remaining signals):**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a `CH₃-CH₂-` fragment.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). This is a `CH₃-CH-` fragment.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is likely the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment, which is coupled to both the terminal CH₃ and the methine (CH) group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is the methine group (-CH-). It is attached to the benzene ring (making it benzylic), the CH₃ group (doublet), and the CH₂ group (multiplet), hence its complex splitting pattern.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Putting the fragments together (`CH₃-CH₂-` and `CH₃-CH-`) with the methine group being the point of attachment to the ring, we get a `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-` group, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the combined data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option C, but the question asks for the product of the reaction, not the identity of X.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reactants:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents (Red P / HI) is a very strong reducing agent. It is known for its ability to completely reduce various oxygen-containing functional groups, including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and, most importantly here, carboxylic acids, down to the corresponding alkane.\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The rest of the molecule, including the stable aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group, will remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Reaction: Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Product: The -COOH at position 1 is converted to -CH₃, while the sec-butyl group at position 4 remains. The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches our derived product.\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl chain does not rearrange from sec-butyl to isobutyl.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, Compound X.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
