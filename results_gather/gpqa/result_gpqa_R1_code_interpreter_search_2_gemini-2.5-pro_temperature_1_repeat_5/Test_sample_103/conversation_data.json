    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method to detect exoplanets. This method works by observing the periodic Doppler shift of spectral lines from a star. This shift is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as it orbits the common center of mass with its planet.\n\nThe observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight:\n$ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe problem gives the *periodic shift* \"up to\" a certain value. This \"up to\" value represents the maximum shift, $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$, which corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star. This maximum velocity is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted by $K$.\n\nTherefore, the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n$ K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max} $\n\n### 2. Relate the Given Data to the RV Semi-Amplitude (K)\n\nWe are given:\n- Wavelength shift for planet #1, $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms.\n- Wavelength shift for planet #2, $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n\nFrom the proportionality above, we can find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $\n\n### 3. Derive the Relationship between K and the Orbital Period (T)\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} $\n(This formula assumes the planet's mass $m_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$, which is true here).\n\nIn this formula:\n- $T$ is the orbital period.\n- $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n- $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n- $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n- $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n### 4. Apply the Formula to the Specific Problem\n\nThe problem states that:\n- The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n- The planets have the same mass: $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$.\n\nThe problem does not mention the orbital inclinations ($i$). In such physics problems, when a parameter is not mentioned, we typically assume it is the same for the systems being compared. Therefore, we assume $i_1 = i_2$, which means $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$.\n\nWith these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a proportionality between $K$ and $T$:\n$ K \\propto T^{-1/3} $\n\n### 5. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nNow we can use the ratio of the K values to find the ratio of the T values:\n$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3} $\n\nWe know $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$, so:\n$ 1.4 = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3} $\n\nTo solve for the period ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, we can raise both sides to the power of -3:\n$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (1.4)^{-3} = \\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^{-3} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^{3} $\n\nLet's compute the final value.\n$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} $\n\nNow, we perform the division to get a decimal value.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\nratio_K = 7 / 5\nratio_T = ratio_K**(-3)\nprint(ratio_T)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.3644.\n\n### 6. Compare with the Options\n\nThe calculated ratio is ~0.364. Let's look at the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value matches option A very closely.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Radial Velocity and Wavelength Shift:** The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude, denoted as $K$, is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$).\n    $ K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max} $\n    Given $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $\n\n2.  **RV Semi-Amplitude and Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n    $ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} $\n    where $T$ is the orbital period, $m_p$ is the planet mass, $M_{star}$ is the star mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Relation:** The problem states that the star masses are identical ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planet masses are similar ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$). Assuming the unstated orbital inclinations are also the same ($i_1 = i_2$), all factors in the equation are constant except for $K$ and $T$. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    $ K \\propto T^{-1/3} $\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now express the ratio of the semi-amplitudes in terms of the ratio of the orbital periods:\n    $ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3} $\n    Substituting the known value of the K-ratio:\n    $ 1.4 = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3} $\n    To solve for the period ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, we raise both sides to the power of -3:\n    $ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (1.4)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
