    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to compute the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\n    The problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a1)) * (2 * a2 / R_star))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n    So, the problem reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2 / a1.\n\n4.  **Relate Observables to the Semi-Major Axis:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the amplitude of the star's velocity (K) caused by the planet's gravitational pull. For a circular orbit viewed edge-on (which is a good assumption since the planets also transit), the star's velocity amplitude K is given by:\n    K = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, G is the gravitational constant, and `a` is the semi-major axis.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis `a`:** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\n    a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio a2 / a1:** Now we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet2 and Planet1:\n    a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]\n\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n7.  **Determine the Ratios of Mass and Velocity Amplitude:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n        M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):** The velocity amplitude K is related to the Doppler shift Δλ by K = c * (Δλ / λ_0).\n        K1 = c * (Δλ_1 / λ_0) = c * (0.03 Å / 6300 Å)\n        K2 = c * (Δλ_2 / λ_0) = c * (0.04 Å / 6300 Å)\n        The ratio K1 / K2 is:\n        K1 / K2 = (c * 0.03 / 6300) / (c * 0.04 / 6300) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n8.  **Calculate a2 / a1:** Substitute the ratios back into the equation:\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n10. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given ratios\n# Mass ratio of Planet2 to Planet1\nm_ratio_2_over_1 = 5 / 7\n\n# Doppler shift for Planet1\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift for Planet2\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of the stellar velocity amplitudes K1/K2 is equal to the ratio of the doppler shifts\nk_ratio_1_over_2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes a2/a1 is given by (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (m_ratio_2_over_1**2) * (k_ratio_1_over_2**2)\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T1/T2 is sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio_1_over_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(f\"{temp_ratio_1_over_2:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's the detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n*   A = Planet's albedo\n*   R_star = Star's radius\n*   a = Semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms in the equation cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a1)) * (2 * a2 / R_star))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis simplifies the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**4. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:**\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the velocity amplitude (K) of the star as it wobbles due to the planet's gravity. For a circular orbit, this amplitude is given by:\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nwhich can be simplified to:\nK = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nFrom this, we can solve for 'a':\nK^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\nNow we can set up the ratio for the semi-major axes:\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n**6. Determine the Ratios of Mass and Velocity Amplitude:**\n*   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n    *   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):**\n    The radial velocity amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ_0), where c and λ_0 are constants.\n    *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å (for Planet1)\n    *   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å (for Planet2)\n    *   K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Result:**\nFirst, substitute the ratios back into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\nNow, substitute this value into the temperature ratio equation from step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nFinally, compute the decimal value:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53. The Python code confirms this calculation, yielding `0.54` after rounding to two decimal places. Comparing this to the given options, the closest choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
