    # Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation
    # Principle: Catalytic hydrogenation (H2, Pd/C) selectively reduces the less substituted
    # and less sterically hindered double bond. (R)-Limonene has a trisubstituted endocyclic
    # double bond and a disubstituted exocyclic double bond. The exocyclic one is reduced.
    # The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected.
    # Product 1: (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene
    product_1_stereocenters = {"C4": "R"}
    
    # Step 2: Epoxidation
    # Principle: Epoxidation with m-CPBA is diastereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4
    # directs the attack to the opposite face of the ring (anti-attack).
    # For a (4R) starting material, this results in a (1S, 2R) configuration for the new epoxide stereocenters.
    # Product 2: (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane

    # Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening
    # Principle: Under basic conditions (NaOMe), the reaction is an Sₙ2 attack.
    # Regioselectivity: The nucleophile (MeO-) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon (C2, secondary)
    # instead of the more hindered one (C1, tertiary).
    # Stereospecificity: The Sₙ2 attack proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked center (C2).
    # The configuration at C2 inverts from R to S. C1 and C4 are unchanged.
    # Product 3: (1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol
    product_3_stereocenters = {"C1": "S", "C2": "S", "C4": "R"}

    # Step 4: Steglich Esterification
    # Principle: This esterification method converts the alcohol to an ester with retention of configuration.
    # The stereocenters are not affected.
    # Product 4: (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate
