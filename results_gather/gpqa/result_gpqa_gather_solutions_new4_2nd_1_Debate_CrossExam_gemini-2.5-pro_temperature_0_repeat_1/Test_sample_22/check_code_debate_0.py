    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the correct products.

    ### 1. Analysis of Reactants and Reaction Conditions

    *   **Reactant:** The starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Its structure, `C₆H₅-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH₂`, contains three key functional groups: an aromatic ring, an ether linkage, and an alkene (double bond).
    *   **Reagent:** The reagent is hydrogen bromide (HBr), which is a strong acid. In solution, it acts as a source of an electrophile (a proton, H⁺).
    *   **Observation:** The formation of two new spots on a TLC plate indicates that at least two major products are formed in the reaction.

    ### 2. The Reaction Mechanism

    The most probable reaction mechanism involves several steps, initiated by the most reactive site in the reactant molecule.

    **Step 1: Electrophilic Attack on the Alkene**
    The electron-rich double bond of the alkene is the most reactive site for an attack by the electrophilic proton (H⁺) from HBr. According to **Markovnikov's rule**, the proton will add to the carbon atom of the double bond that has more hydrogen atoms (the terminal `=CH₂` group). This ensures the formation of the most stable possible carbocation on the adjacent, more substituted carbon.

    *   `C₆H₅-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH₂ + H⁺ → C₆H₅-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-C⁺H-CH₃`

    This step creates a **secondary carbocation** intermediate.

    **Step 2: Competing Pathways for the Carbocation**
    The formation of two products is explained by two competing pathways that this carbocation can follow. Both pathways involve the electron-rich benzene ring acting as an internal nucleophile to attack the carbocation (an intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation). Such intramolecular reactions are often very fast and favored when they can form stable 5- or 6-membered rings.

    *   **Pathway A: Direct Cyclization (6-Membered Ring Formation)**
        The secondary carbocation is attacked directly by the ortho-position of the benzene ring. Counting the atoms involved in the new ring (O, the three carbons of the side chain, and two carbons of the aromatic ring) shows that this cyclization forms a stable **six-membered ring**. After a final deprotonation step to restore the aromaticity of the benzene ring, the first product is formed.
        *   **Product 1: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane**

    *   **Pathway B: Rearrangement followed by Cyclization (5-Membered Ring Formation)**
        Carbocations are prone to rearranging to form more stable species. The secondary carbocation can undergo a **1,2-methyl shift**, where a methyl group from the adjacent quaternary carbon migrates to the carbocation center. This rearrangement forms a more stable **tertiary carbocation**.
        *   `...-C(CH₃)₂-C⁺H-CH₃ → ...-C⁺(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)₂`
        The benzene ring then attacks this new, more stable tertiary carbocation. This cyclization forms a stable **five-membered ring**. After deprotonation, the second product is formed.
        *   **Product 2: 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran**

    ### 3. Evaluation of the Given Options

    Based on the detailed mechanistic analysis, the two products formed are **3,3,4-trimethylchromane** and **3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran**. Now, we compare this result with the given options:

    *   **A) 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol:** These products would require cleavage of the stable aryl-ether bond and reduction of the double bond, which is not what happens under these reaction conditions.
    *   **B) 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran:** This option perfectly matches the two products predicted by the competing intramolecular cyclization pathways.
    *   **C) (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene:** This option includes an anti-Markovnikov addition product (4-bromo-), which is not expected under these ionic conditions, and an elimination product. It ignores the highly favorable cyclization.
    *   **D) (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene:** This option suggests simple addition of HBr across the double bond. While the Markovnikov product (3-bromo-) is a possible side product, the intramolecular cyclization to form stable rings is the dominant pathway. Furthermore, the anti-Markovnikov product (4-bromo-) is mechanistically incorrect.

    ### Conclusion

    The reaction proceeds via protonation of the alkene to form a carbocation, which then undergoes two competing intramolecular cyclization reactions. One pathway gives a 6-membered ring directly, while the other involves a rearrangement to a more stable carbocation before forming a 5-membered ring. This leads to the formation of the two products listed in option B.
