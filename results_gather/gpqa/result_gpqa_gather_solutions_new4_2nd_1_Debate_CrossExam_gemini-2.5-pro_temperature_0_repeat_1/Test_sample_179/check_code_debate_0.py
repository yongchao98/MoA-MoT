    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the physics problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum electrostatic potential energy of a system of 13 charges.
    - 1 charge (q) at the center.
    - 12 charges (q) on a sphere of radius r.
    - q = 2e, r = 2m.

    The minimum energy configuration for the 12 charges on the sphere is an icosahedron (Thomson problem).
    The total energy U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere.
    U_total = 12 * (k*q^2/r) + E_12 * (k*q^2/r) = (12 + E_12) * (k*q^2/r).
    E_12 is the dimensionless energy constant for the icosahedron, approx. 49.165.
