Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by carefully evaluating the chemical reaction and the provided options.

### **1. Analysis of the Starting Material and Reaction Type**

*   **Starting Material**: The reaction begins with `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is a key intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is derived from the reaction of the ketone **pentan-2-one** (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`) and the secondary amine **N-methylethanamine**.
*   **Reaction Type**: The reagents listed—a strong base (LDA), an alkylating agent (ethyl iodide), and an acid workup (H₃O⁺)—are characteristic of an **α-alkylation of a ketone**. This is a multi-step process to add an alkyl group to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group.

### **2. Analysis of the Reagent Sequence (A)**

A successful multi-step synthesis requires that the reagents be added in a specific, logical order.

*   **Step (i) - Formation of the Nucleophile**: A strong base is required to deprotonate an α-carbon to create a nucleophile (an enamine). **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is the base, and **DME** is the solvent. This must be the first step.
*   **Step (ii) - Alkylation**: The nucleophile created in the first step attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)**. This step must follow the formation of the nucleophile.
*   **Step (iii) - Hydrolysis**: Finally, an acidic workup with **H₃O⁺** is used to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back into the final ketone product. This must be the last step.

Therefore, the only chemically valid sequence is the stepwise addition: **(i) LDA, DME**, followed by **(ii) CH₃CH₂I**, and finally **(iii) H₃O⁺**.

Let's evaluate the sequences in the given options:
*   Options A and C list the correct sequence: `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`.
*   Options B and D list an incorrect sequence: `(ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺`. Adding the acid (H₃O⁺) at the same time as the alkylating agent would destroy the nucleophile, preventing the reaction. Thus, options B and D are incorrect.

### **3. Analysis of the Product (B)**

Now we must determine the correct product between options A and C.

*   **Regioselectivity**: The base, LDA, is sterically bulky. When reacting with an unsymmetrical ketone like pentan-2-one, it preferentially removes a proton from the **less sterically hindered** α-carbon. Pentan-2-one has two α-positions: the methyl group at C1 (`CH₃-`) and the methylene group at C3 (`-CH₂-`). The C1 methyl group is less hindered. This is known as kinetic control.
*   **Alkylation**: Deprotonation occurs at C1, and the subsequent alkylation with ethyl iodide adds an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) to this position.
*   **Final Structure**: The original pentan-2-one skeleton (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`) is modified by adding an ethyl group to C1.
    *   Original C1 group: `CH₃-`
    *   Added group: `CH₃CH₂-`
    *   New group at C1 position: `CH₃CH₂-CH₂-`
    *   The resulting ketone structure is: `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.
*   **Nomenclature**: To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain containing the carbonyl group, which is seven carbons long (a heptane chain). Numbering from either end places the carbonyl group at position 4. The correct name for product B is **heptan-4-one**.

### **4. Final Conclusion**

We must find the option with both the correct reagent sequence and the correct final product.

*   **Option A**: A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺; B = heptan-4-one.
    *   Reagent sequence is **correct**.
    *   Product is **correct**.
*   **Option C**: A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺; B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine.
    *   Reagent sequence is **correct**.
    *   Product is **incorrect**. (Pentan-2-one is the starting material, implying no reaction occurred).

Based on this detailed analysis, Option A is the only choice that correctly identifies both the reaction sequence and the final product.
