    Checks the correctness of the answer to the physics problem about particle decay and Lorentz factors.

    The problem states:
    - Initial Lorentz factor (gamma_1) = 20
    - Initial survival fraction (f1) = 1/3
    - Target survival fraction (f2) = 2/3
    - Find the new Lorentz factor (gamma_2).

    The physical model leads to the formula:
    f = exp(-K / gamma)
    where K is a constant.
    From this, we can derive a ratio:
    gamma_1 * ln(1/f1) = gamma_2 * ln(1/f2)
    So, gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(1/f1) / ln(1/f2)
