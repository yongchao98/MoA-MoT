def check_transit_probability_answer():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the exoplanet transit probability problem.

    It calculates the ratio of transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2 based on the
    given physical relationships and compares it to the claim made in the selected answer.

    The key physical principles are:
    1. Transit Probability (p_tr) is proportional to R_s / a (Stellar Radius / Semi-major Axis).
    2. Kepler's Third Law: P^2 is proportional to a^3 / M_s (Period^2 prop. to Semi-major Axis^3 / Stellar Mass).
    """

    # --- Define the relationships from the problem statement ---
    # Let's use ratios to represent the relationships.
    # "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2"
    # P1 = P2 / 3  =>  P2_over_P1 = 3
    P2_over_P1 = 3.0

    # "The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2"
    # Ms1 = 2 * Ms2 => Ms1_over_Ms2 = 2
    Ms1_over_Ms2 = 2.0

    # "both host stars have the same radii"
    # Rs1 = Rs2 => Rs1_over_Rs2 = 1
    Rs1_over_Rs2 = 1.0

    # --- Step 1: Formulate the ratio of probabilities ---
    # p1 / p2 = (Rs1 / a1) / (Rs2 / a2)
    # p1 / p2 = (Rs1 / Rs2) * (a2 / a1)
    # Since Rs1 / Rs2 = 1, the probability ratio simplifies to:
    # p1 / p2 = a2 / a1

    # --- Step 2: Use Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of semi-major axes ---
    # From P^2 ∝ a^3 / Ms, we can derive a ∝ (P^2 * Ms)^(1/3)
    # Therefore, a2 / a1 = [ (P2^2 * Ms2) / (P1^2 * Ms1) ]^(1/3)
    # This can be rewritten using our ratios:
    # a2 / a1 = [ (P2/P1)^2 * (Ms2/Ms1) ]^(1/3)

    # We have Ms1_over_Ms2, so Ms2_over_Ms1 is its reciprocal.
    Ms2_over_Ms1 = 1.0 / Ms1_over_Ms2

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the numerical ratio ---
    # Calculate the term inside the cube root
    term_inside_cube_root = (P2_over_P1**2) * Ms2_over_Ms1
    # term_inside_cube_root = (3^2) * (1/2) = 9 * 0.5 = 4.5

    # Calculate the ratio of semi-major axes, which equals the probability ratio
    calculated_ratio_p1_over_p2 = term_inside_cube_root**(1/3)

    # --- Step 4: Check the provided answer ---
    # The final answer given is 'A'.
    # The text for option A is: "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit."
    # This implies two conditions must be met:
    # 1. Planet_1 is preferred, which means the ratio p1/p2 must be greater than 1.
    # 2. The value of this ratio must be approximately 1.65.

    expected_preference = "Planet_1"
    expected_factor = 1.65
    tolerance = 0.01 # Allow for rounding in the question's value (~1.65)

    # Check preference

        actual_preference = "Planet_1"
    else:
        actual_preference = "Planet_2"

    if actual_preference != expected_preference:
        return (f"Incorrect. The answer states {expected_preference} is preferred, but the "
