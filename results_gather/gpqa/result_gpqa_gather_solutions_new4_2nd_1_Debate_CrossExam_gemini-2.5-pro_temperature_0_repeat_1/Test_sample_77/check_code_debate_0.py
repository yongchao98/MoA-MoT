Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating careful points to consider, to determine the final correct answer.

### Step-by-step Analysis

1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. These potentials correctly account for the finite speed of light, `c`, an effect known as retardation.

2.  **Understand the Concept of Retarded Time**: The field observed at a point $\vec{r}$ at time `t` is not caused by the charge's simultaneous state. Instead, it's caused by the charge's state at an earlier, "retarded" time, $t_r$. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it took for the field to propagate from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\vec{r}$. Using the notation from the problem, this is defined by the relation: $t - t_r = d/c$.

3.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The standard derivation from Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge yields the following expressions for the potentials, where all source-related quantities ($\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$:
    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \left[ \dfrac{q}{d - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} \right]$
    *   Vector Potential: $\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \left[ \dfrac{q\vec{v}}{d - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} \right]$

4.  **Match the Formula to the Options' Format**: The given options have a slightly different algebraic form in the denominator. We can rewrite the derived potentials to match this format by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:
    *   $V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \dfrac{q \cdot c}{c(d - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c})} = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}$
    *   $\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \dfrac{q\vec{v} \cdot c}{c(d - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c})} = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}$

5.  **Compare with the Given Options**: Now, we can carefully compare these correct expressions with the choices provided.
    *   **A)** $V(\vec{r},t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c + \vec{d}. \vec{v})},  \vec{A(\vec{r},t)} = \dfrac{\mu qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c + \vec{d}. \vec{v})}$: **Incorrect**. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to "advanced potentials," which violate causality and are generally considered unphysical.
    *   **B)** $V(\vec{r},t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r},  \vec{A(\vec{r},t)} = \dfrac{\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\vec{r},t)$: **Incorrect**. This uses the static Coulomb potential for V, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the retardation effect in the denominator.
    *   **C)** $V(\vec{r},t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})},  \vec{A(\vec{r},t)} = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})}$: **Correct**. This option perfectly matches the derived expressions for both the scalar and vector Liénard-Wiechert potentials.
    *   **D)** $V(\vec{r},t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r}, \vec{A(\vec{r},t)} = \dfrac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r},t)$: **Incorrect**. While the relationship $\vec{A} = (\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is the wrong static potential.

### Careful Points
*   **Retardation is Key**: The potential from a moving charge is not the simple static potential ($V \propto 1/r$). The denominator is fundamentally modified to account for the changing distance the field signal travels as the source moves. This immediately rules out options B and D.
*   **The Sign of the Denominator**: The negative sign in the term $(dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})$ is a critical feature of the physically real, causal "retarded potentials". It ensures that the potential is enhanced when the charge moves towards the observer ($\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} > 0$) due to a "compression" of the emitted field, a phenomenon related to the Doppler effect. A positive sign would describe an unphysical "advanced potential" where the effect precedes the cause. This rules out option A.
*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: A review of the provided candidate answers shows that nearly all of them correctly derive the physical formulas that match Option C. However, many of them make a clerical error in the final step, incorrectly mapping their correct derivation to the wrong letter choice (A, B, or D). The consensus of the *physical reasoning* across all candidates strongly supports the formulas in Option C.
