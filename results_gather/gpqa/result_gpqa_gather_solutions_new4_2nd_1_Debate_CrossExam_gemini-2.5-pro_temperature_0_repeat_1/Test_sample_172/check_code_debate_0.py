    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the physics problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) given:
    - Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 0.1 nm

    The solution involves:
    1. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)
    2. Energy-Momentum Relation: ΔE = v * Δp
