    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by modeling the biological context.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Define the cellular state based on the question (G1 arrest, active transcription, inhibited replication).
    2. Define the function of each protein complex given in the options.
    3. The question asks for the LEAST observed complex in an assay for ACTIVE (transcriptionally active) chromatin.
    4. Therefore, the complex associated with the INHIBITED process (replication) is the correct answer.
