    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by recalculating the physical quantities.

    The question asks to compare the order of magnitude of:
    1. The paramagnetic coupling term: ⟨H⟩ = m * μ_B * B
    2. The transition energy: ΔE = h * c / λ

    The provided answer calculates these values, concludes that ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE, and selects option C.
    This code will verify the calculations and the physical conclusion.
