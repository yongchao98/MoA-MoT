Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points derived from the provided candidate answers.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

**1. Analysis of Reaction 1**

*   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`
*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation**. A ketone (butan-2-one) is converted into a cyanohydrin by adding the elements of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) across the carbonyl double bond.
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a potent nucleophile provided by the dissociation of NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbon of the carbonyl group in butan-2-one.
    2.  This nucleophilic attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate called an alkoxide.
    3.  This alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to yield the final, stable hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product.
*   **Determining Reagent A:** Reagent A's function is to provide the proton (H⁺) for this final step.
    *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acid. It is an excellent source of protons and is the standard reagent used for the acidic workup required to complete this reaction.
    *   `NaHSO₃` (sodium bisulfite) is an incorrect choice. While it does react with ketones in a different nucleophilic addition reaction to form bisulfite adducts, it is not the correct reagent to complete a cyanohydrin synthesis initiated by NaCN.
*   **Conclusion for A:** The correct reagent for **A is H₃O⁺**.

**2. Analysis of Reaction 2**

*   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`
*   **Reaction Type:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a **nitrile hydrolysis**.
*   **Mechanism and Conditions:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile is a robust reaction that does not occur easily. It requires harsh conditions, typically heating in the presence of water and a strong catalyst. The catalyst can be either a strong acid or a strong base.
*   **Determining Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for this hydrolysis. We must evaluate the given options.
    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and highly effective catalyst for driving the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.
    *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to efficiently catalyze this hydrolysis to completion under typical laboratory conditions. The reaction would be impractically slow or would stop at the intermediate amide stage.
*   **Conclusion for B:** The most suitable and effective reagent for **B is HCl**.

### Careful Points and Synthesis

*   **Consensus on Chemistry:** A review of all the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the underlying chemical principles. Nearly every detailed analysis correctly identifies that A must be H₃O⁺ and B must be HCl.
*   **Source of Discrepancy:** The wide variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidate answers is not due to a disagreement on the chemistry. Instead, it indicates that the agents were likely presented with the same question but with the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) arranged in a different order.
*   **Final Decision Logic:** Therefore, the most reliable method to determine the correct answer is to ignore the final letter choices of the other agents and instead rely on the consistent chemical reasoning they present. We must apply this correct chemical conclusion to the specific set of options provided in this prompt.

### Final Conclusion

1.  The required reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺**.
2.  The required reagent **B** is **HCl**.
3.  We must now find the option that matches this pair: `A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl`.

Let's examine the options:
*   A) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
*   **B) A = H3O+, B = HCl**
*   C) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
*   D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

The correct combination of reagents is found in option B.
