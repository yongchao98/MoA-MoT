The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).
Arrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.

2. Hydroxide
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct ranking of the nucleophiles.

### Analysis of the Core Chemical Principles

The question requires ranking nucleophilicity in an **aqueous solution**, which is a **polar protic solvent**. All the high-quality candidate answers correctly identify that the following principles must be applied in a specific order:

1.  **Charge:** Anions are always more potent nucleophiles than their neutral counterparts.
2.  **The Nucleophilic Atom (in a Protic Solvent):** Nucleophilicity increases down a group in the periodic table (e.g., S > O). This is because larger atoms are more polarizable and, critically, are less hindered by the "cage" of solvent molecules (solvation) that forms around smaller, more charge-dense ions in a protic solvent.
3.  **Resonance:** If a negative charge is delocalized by resonance, the nucleophile is stabilized and therefore less reactive.
4.  **Steric Hindrance:** Bulkier groups around the nucleophilic atom physically block its approach to an electrophile, reducing its reactivity.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

A careful point-by-point analysis, which is in agreement with the reasoning of the vast majority of the candidate answers, proceeds as follows:

*   **Point 1: Identify the Poorest Nucleophile.**
    Methanol (4) is the only neutral molecule. All other species are anions. Due to its lack of a negative charge, Methanol is the least reactive nucleophile.
    *   **Conclusion:** The sequence must end with **4**.

*   **Point 2: Identify the Most Reactive Nucleophile.**
    The candidates must be compared based on the attacking atom. We have oxygen nucleophiles (1, 2, 3) and a sulfur nucleophile (5). Sulfur is below oxygen in the periodic table. In a polar protic solvent like water, the larger, more polarizable, and less solvated sulfur atom makes **Ethanethiolate (5)** the most reactive nucleophile.
    *   **Conclusion:** The sequence must begin with **5**.

*   **Point 3: Evaluate the Effect of Resonance.**
    We now rank the remaining oxygen anions: Hydroxide (2), 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), and Propionate (3). The negative charge in **Propionate (3)** is delocalized across two oxygen atoms by resonance. This stabilization makes it significantly less reactive than both Hydroxide and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, where the charge is localized on a single oxygen.
    *   **Conclusion:** Propionate (3) is less reactive than both (1) and (2).

*   **Point 4: Evaluate the Effect of Steric Hindrance.**
    The final comparison is between Hydroxide (2) and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1). While the alkoxide (1) is a slightly stronger base, it is attached to a very bulky 4-methylcyclohexyl group. The **Hydroxide ion (2)** is extremely small. The significant steric hindrance of the alkoxide makes it a less effective nucleophile than the small, unhindered hydroxide ion.
    *   **Conclusion:** Hydroxide (2) is more reactive than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1).

### Final Synthesis

Assembling these points gives a clear and unambiguous order of reactivity from most reactive to poorest reactive:

1.  **Ethanethiolate (5)** (Most polarizable atom in a protic solvent)
2.  **Hydroxide (2)** (Strong, small, unhindered nucleophile)
3.  **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)** (Strong, but sterically hindered nucleophile)
4.  **Propionate (3)** (Weakened by resonance)
5.  **Methanol (4)** (Poorest, as it is a neutral molecule)

The correct sequence is **5, 2, 1, 3, 4**. This sequence matches option C.
