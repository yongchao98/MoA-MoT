def check_spin_expectation_value():

    Checks the calculation of the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction.

    The problem is:
    An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin
    along y-direction, S_y.
    Note: σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
    The spin operator S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.
    The expectation value <A> = <ψ|A|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>.

    The provided answer is A, which corresponds to -12*hbar/25.
    We need to verify if the calculated value matches -12/25 * ħ.
