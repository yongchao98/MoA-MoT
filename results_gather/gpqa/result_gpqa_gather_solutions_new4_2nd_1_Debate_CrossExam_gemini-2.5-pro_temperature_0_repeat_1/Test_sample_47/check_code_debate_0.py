Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, including all the careful points required to arrive at the correct answer.

### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**

*   **Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br₂).
*   **Analysis:** This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, the reaction at either α-carbon yields the same product.
*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.

### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**

*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
*   **Analysis:** This is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base. The key transformation is the **Favorskii rearrangement**.
*   **Careful Point:** Recognizing this named reaction is crucial. The mechanism involves the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, which then undergoes ring-opening. The result is a **ring contraction**. The original six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring.
*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.

### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**

*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.
*   **Analysis:** This is a standard and efficient laboratory method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.
*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.

### **Step 4: Determine the Structure of Product 4**

*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).
*   **Analysis:** This is a selective reduction.
*   **Careful Point:** It is essential to know the specific reactivity of this reagent. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. Its specific purpose is to reduce highly reactive functional groups like acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without proceeding to the alcohol. A stronger reagent like LiAlH₄ would have produced an alcohol.
*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.

### **Step 5: Count the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**

The final and most complex part of the question is to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to predicting the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.

*   **Structure:** The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.
*   **Symmetry Analysis:**
    *   **Careful Point (Time-Averaged Symmetry):** The five-membered cyclopentane ring is not planar and rapidly interconverts between different puckered conformations. On the NMR timescale, this rapid change results in a time-averaged structure that possesses an *effective* plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1.
    *   **Careful Point (Diastereotopicity):** The presence of a substituent on C1 makes it a prochiral center. This has a critical consequence for the CH₂ groups on the ring. The two hydrogens on any given CH₂ group are **diastereotopic**, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent because they have different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group.

*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Environments:**
    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (H-C=O):** This proton is in a unique environment, bonded to a carbonyl carbon. This is **one** distinct type.
    2.  **The C1 Proton:** The single proton on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. It lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **second** distinct type.
    3.  **The C2 and C5 Protons:** The plane of symmetry makes the CH₂ group at C2 equivalent to the CH₂ group at C5. However, as noted above, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. By symmetry, the "upper" proton on C2 is equivalent to the "upper" proton on C5, and the "lower" proton on C2 is equivalent to the "lower" proton on C5. This gives **two** more distinct types of hydrogens.
    4.  **The C3 and C4 Protons:** The same logic applies. The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. These four protons give rise to another **two** distinct types of hydrogens, which are different from the C2/C5 protons due to their different distance from the aldehyde group.

*   **Total Count:** Summing the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6**.

The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4 is 6. This corresponds to option B.
