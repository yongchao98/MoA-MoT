    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by modeling the
    physical principles of the mean free path problem.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Establish the formulas for λ1 (gas-gas) and λ2 (electron-gas).
    2.  Derive the ratio λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg).
    3.  Apply the physical principle that for high-energy electrons, the scattering
        cross-section (σ_eg) is much smaller than the kinetic cross-section (σ_gg).
        This means the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is > 1.
    4.  Conclude that λ2 / λ1 must be greater than sqrt(2) (~1.414).
    5.  Evaluate which of the given options (A, B, C, D) is consistent with this conclusion.
