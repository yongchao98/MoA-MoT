    # Principle 1: Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) is inversely proportional to the square root of orbital distance (a).
    # T_eq ∝ 1 / √a  =>  a ∝ 1 / T_eq²

    # Principle 2: Kepler's Third Law states that the orbital period (P) squared is proportional to the orbital distance cubed.
    # P² ∝ a³  =>  P ∝ a^(3/2)

    # Combining the principles to get a direct relationship between Period (P) and Temperature (T_eq):
    # P ∝ (1 / T_eq²)^(3/2)  =>  P ∝ 1 / T_eq³  =>  P ∝ T_eq⁻³
    # This means the ratio of periods is the inverse cube of the ratio of temperatures.
    # P₃ / P₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)³
