    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.

    1. Proposer: Identify Substance Z
    The first step is to identify substance Z. It is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The empirical formula is therefore CH₂.

    The problem states that Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), so it must be a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. Furthermore, all other compounds in the problem hydrogenate to form *only* Z, which implies they all share the same carbon skeleton. The reaction described (disproportionation to form an aromatic compound) is characteristic of a six-membered ring. Given that Z is also a widely used solvent, it can be confidently identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.

    2. Skeptic: Cross-examination of Step 1
    The logic is sound. The combination of the mass fraction, saturation, its role as a common solvent, and it being the ultimate hydrogenation product of all other species strongly points to cyclohexane. There are no other common chemicals that fit all these constraints simultaneously. The identification of Z as C₆H₁₂ is a solid foundation.

    3. Proposer: Identify Mixture Y
    Now, let's identify mixture Y. It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. One component is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). The other component must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. Since it doesn't react with bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only logical candidate with a C₆ skeleton is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under these conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.

    4. Skeptic: Cross-examination of Step 2
    This deduction is also robust. The properties of mixture Y—being equimolar, containing cyclohexane, not reacting with bromine water, and its other component hydrogenating to cyclohexane—leave benzene as the only plausible second component. The reaction type, disproportionation, further supports the formation of a saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic ring from an unsaturated precursor.

    5. Proposer: Use Conservation of Atoms to Find the Answer
    The core of the problem can be solved by analyzing the reaction:
    `Mixture X → Mixture Y`

    Since both are equimolar mixtures, we can write the reaction for one molecule of each component:
    `Liquid A + Liquid B (from Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (from Mixture Y)`

    By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.

    Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆) = 12 + 6 = **18**.

    6. Skeptic: Final Check for Consistency
    This is a direct and elegant solution. To ensure it's correct, let's verify that a plausible Mixture X exists. The components of X must be C₆ cyclic compounds, be unsaturated (decolorize bromine water), and have no conjugated bonds. Their total hydrogen count must be 18.

    The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.
    *   **Hydrogen Count**: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our result.
    *   **Unsaturation**: Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.
    *   **Conjugation**: Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds, which fits the problem's constraint. The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and is thus excluded.
    *   **Hydrogenation**: Both have a C₆ ring and will hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

    The existence of this chemically plausible pair confirms that the answer derived from the conservation of atoms is correct. The total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.

    Conclusion
    The analysis consistently shows that the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option D.
