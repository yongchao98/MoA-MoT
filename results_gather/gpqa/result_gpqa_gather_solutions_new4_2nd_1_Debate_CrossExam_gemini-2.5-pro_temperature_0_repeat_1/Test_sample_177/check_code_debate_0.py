    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the QFT question by:
    1. Defining the fundamental principles of dimensional analysis in 4D spacetime.
    2. Calculating the mass dimensions of the fermion field (psi) and the field strength tensor (F).
    3. Using the dimensions of the fields to calculate the mass dimension of the coupling constant (kappa).
    4. Applying the power-counting rule to determine the renormalizability of the theory.
    5. Comparing the calculated results with the claims of the provided answer (Option C).
