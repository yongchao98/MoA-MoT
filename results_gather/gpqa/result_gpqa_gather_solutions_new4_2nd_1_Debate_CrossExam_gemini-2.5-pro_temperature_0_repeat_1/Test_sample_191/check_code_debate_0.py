**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.

**Question**:
Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$

A) $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{l^2}$

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning from the provided candidate answers.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1.  **Charge Induction:** When the positive point charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor, it attracts the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. By applying Gauss's Law to a surface within the conductor's material (where the electric field must be zero), we can deduce that the total induced charge on the inner surface must be `-q` to cancel the charge within the cavity.

2.  **Charge Conservation:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (net charge of zero). To conserve charge, if a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding charge of `+q` must be left on the outer surface of the conductor.

3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** This is the most critical concept for this problem. The conducting material acts as a "Faraday cage," shielding the exterior from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity. The combined electric field from the original charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero for all points outside the cavity. Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *only* by the charge residing on the outer surface of the conductor.

4.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface is shielded from the asymmetric arrangement of charges inside. Since the outer surface is a sphere, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface to achieve the lowest energy state and make the surface an equipotential.

5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to the Shell Theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.
    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.
    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor.
    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center.

6.  **Final Formula:** Using Coulomb's Law, the magnitude of the electric field is:
    $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$

### Careful Points to Consider

*   **Electrostatic Shielding is the Key Principle:** The conductor isolates the outside from the inside. The field outside is only due to the charge on the outer surface.
*   **Irrelevant Parameters:** The details of the cavity's size (`r`), its position (`s`), the distance from the cavity's center to the point P (`l`), and the angle (`θ`) are all distractors. They do not affect the electric field outside the conductor.
*   **Symmetry of the Outer Surface:** The uniform distribution of charge on the outer surface is a direct result of its spherical shape. If the conductor were not a sphere, the charge distribution would not be uniform, and the external field would be more complex.
*   **Correct Distance:** The electric field calculation must use the distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor, as this is the center of the uniform charge distribution on the outer surface. The distance `l` from the center of the cavity is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The physical reasoning, which is agreed upon by the vast majority of the candidate answers, unambiguously leads to the formula $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$. Comparing this result to the provided options:

A) $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{l^2}$
B) $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$
C) $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{(l-s \cos\theta)^2}$
D) $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{(l+s \cos\theta)^2}$

The correct option is B.
