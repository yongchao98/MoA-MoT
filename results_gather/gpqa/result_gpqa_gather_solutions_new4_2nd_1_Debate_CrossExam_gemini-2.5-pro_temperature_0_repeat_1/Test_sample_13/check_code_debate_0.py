    # Scientific reasoning behind the correct answer
    # 1. Understand the methods:
    #    - PFA: Short-range crosslinker (protein-DNA). Standard method.
    #    - PFA+DSG: Dual crosslinker. DSG is a longer-range protein-protein crosslinker.
    #      It's used to stabilize large protein complexes before locking them to DNA.
    #
    # 2. Analyze the paradox:
    #    - A "stronger" method (PFA+DSG), designed to better capture protein complexes,
    #      is causing a signal to disappear. This points to a technical artifact.
    #
    # 3. Identify the most likely artifact:
    #    - Epitope Masking: The extensive protein-protein crosslinking by DSG can create
    #      a dense web of proteins around the target (IKAROS), physically blocking the
    #      antibody from binding its epitope.
    #    - Insolubility: The over-crosslinking can create massive, insoluble aggregates
    #      that are pelleted and discarded during the experimental procedure.
    #
    # 4. Connect the artifact to a genomic location:
    #    - Both artifacts (epitope masking and insolubility) are most severe where the
    #      local protein density is highest.
    #    - For a transcription factor like IKAROS, its function is to assemble large,
    #      multi-protein regulatory complexes.
    #    - These complexes are assembled at the primary sites of gene regulation:
    #      active promoters and enhancers.
    #
    # 5. Conclusion:
    #    - The disappearing peaks are most likely the true, functional binding sites
    #      that are lost due to a technical failure of the stronger fixation method
    #      in these highly crowded protein environments.
