Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement

The core of the question is to identify the "key factor" that enables the conversion of a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. The specific context is a numerical method for solving higher-dimensional heat equations. The key elements of this method are:

1.  **Discretization:** The heat equation (a partial differential equation) is converted into a large system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form `dU/dt = AU`.
2.  **Time-Stepping Solution:** The solution over a time step involves the matrix exponential, `exp(AΔt)`.
3.  **Approximation:** The computationally expensive matrix exponential is replaced by a "fractional approximation," which is a rational function `R(z) = P(z)/Q(z)`. The update step becomes `U_new ≈ R(AΔt)U_old`.
4.  **Parallelization:** The goal is to use "parallel splitting" to solve this.

The question asks what specific technique allows for this "splitting."

### Step 2: Analyze the Sequential vs. Parallel Computation

*   **Sequential Algorithm:** The approximation `U_new ≈ R(AΔt)U_old` is equivalent to solving the large linear system `Q(AΔt)U_new = P(AΔt)U_old`. This is a single, large, computationally intensive step where all the unknown values in `U_new` are coupled together by the matrix `Q(AΔt)`. This structure is inherently sequential.

*   **Parallel Algorithm:** To parallelize this process, the single large task must be broken down ("split") into multiple smaller, independent tasks that can be solved simultaneously on different processors. The final solution is then assembled from the results of these smaller tasks.

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option as the "Key Factor"

We must evaluate which of the given options provides the mechanism for this "splitting."

*   **A) Complex roots of fractional approximation:** The roots of the denominator of the rational function `R(z)` can be real or complex. This detail affects the implementation of the sub-problems (i.e., whether they require real or complex arithmetic). However, the parallel structure is created by the decomposition itself, regardless of whether the roots are real or complex. Therefore, the decomposition is the more fundamental factor, making this option a detail rather than the key factor.

*   **B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions:** This is a characteristic of the physical problem being modeled. Nonlocal boundary conditions typically introduce long-range dependencies in the matrix `A`, which generally makes parallelization *more difficult*, not easier. This is an obstacle to parallelization, not an enabler.

*   **C) Stability analysis:** Stability is a critical property for any numerical method to be valid and produce a meaningful result. An unstable method is useless, whether it's sequential or parallel. However, stability is a required *property* of the chosen approximation, not the *mechanism* that creates the parallel structure. The conversion from sequential to parallel is an algebraic manipulation. Stability analysis verifies the validity of the method but does not perform the conversion.

*   **D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation:** This is a specific mathematical technique that rewrites a complex rational function `R(z)` as a sum of simpler fractions. For example:
    `R(z) = c₀ + Σ [cⱼ / (z - dⱼ)]`
    When applied to the matrix problem, the calculation of `U_new = R(AΔt)U_old` becomes a sum of independent operations. Each term in the sum corresponds to solving an independent linear system of the form `(AΔt - dⱼI)yⱼ = U_old`. Because each of these systems is independent of the others, they can be solved concurrently on different processors. This algebraic "splitting" is the exact mechanism that converts the single sequential problem into multiple parallel tasks.

### Conclusion

The conversion of the sequential algorithm to a parallel one is fundamentally an algebraic transformation that creates independent tasks from a single dependent one. The **linear partial fraction decomposition** of the fractional approximation is the exact mathematical tool that performs this transformation. The other options represent necessary conditions (stability), problem characteristics (boundary conditions), or implementation details (root types), but they are not the key factor that enables the conversion itself.
