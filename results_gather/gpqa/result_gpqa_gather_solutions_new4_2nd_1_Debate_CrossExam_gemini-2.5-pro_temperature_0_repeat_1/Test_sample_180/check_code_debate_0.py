def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the solar neutrino flux problem.

    The problem asks for the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes:
    Ratio = Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV)
    under the hypothetical scenario that the pp-III branch (source of 8B neutrinos) has stopped.

    This code verifies the physical reasoning by calculating the ratio using
    accepted values from the Standard Solar Model (SSM).
