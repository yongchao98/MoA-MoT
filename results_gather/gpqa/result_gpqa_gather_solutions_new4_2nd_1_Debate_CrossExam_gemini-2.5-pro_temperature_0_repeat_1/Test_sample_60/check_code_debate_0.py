    # Step 1: Nitration of Benzene
    # Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitrobenzene
    product_1 = "Nitrobenzene"
    
    # Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene
    # The nitro group (-NO2) is a meta-director for electrophilic aromatic substitution.
    # Therefore, bromine adds to position 3.
    product_2 = "1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene"
    
    # Step 3: Reduction of the nitro group
    # H2/Pd/C is a standard method to selectively reduce a nitro group to an amine (-NH2)
    # without affecting the aryl-bromide bond.
    product_3 = "3-bromoaniline"
    
    # Step 4: Diazotization of the amine
    # The primary aromatic amine is converted to a diazonium salt.
    product_4 = "3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate"
    
    # Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction
    # The diazonium salt is heated in the presence of anisole. This is a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction,
    # not a Schiemann reaction (which would occur if heated alone).
    # The methoxy group (-OCH3) on anisole is an ortho, para-director.
    # Due to steric hindrance, the incoming radical attacks the para position.
    # The final product is formed by coupling the C1 of the 3-bromophenyl radical
    # with the C4 of the anisole ring.

    # Check 2: Does the LLM's reasoning correctly identify the key steps?
    # The provided text correctly identifies:
    # - Nitration of benzene.
    # - The meta-directing effect of the nitro group in bromination.
    # - The selective reduction of the nitro group to an amine.
    # - The diazotization reaction.
    # - The Gomberg-Bachmann reaction (not Schiemann).
    # - The para-directing effect of the methoxy group (due to sterics).
