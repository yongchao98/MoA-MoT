def check_correctness_of_chemistry_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the given chemistry question.

    The check is based on two definitive principles:
    1. Reaction 2 is a thermal isomerization, so the product's molecular formula
       must match the reactant's (C8H10).
    2. Reaction 3 is a Claisen rearrangement of an allyl vinyl ether, which must
       produce a carbonyl compound (aldehyde/ketone), not an alcohol.
