    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations to determine the final product.

    ### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**

    The first task is to deduce the structure of the initial compound from its molecular formula (C₈H₉NO) and ¹H-NMR data.

    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula C₈H₉NO has a DBE of 5. This high value strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and one additional unit of unsaturation, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.
    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**
        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** A signal above 9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Its splitting into a triplet (t) indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂) group.
        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal for two protons is a doublet (d), confirming it is a methylene group (-CH₂) coupled to a single proton. This confirms the `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.
        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.
        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.

    *   **Conclusion:** Assembling these pieces—a para-substituted ring, an amino group, and an acetaldehyde group—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.

    ### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**

    The starting material undergoes a three-step reaction.

    1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This reagent combination generates nitrous acid (HNO₂) in situ. It reacts with the primary aromatic amine in a **diazotization** reaction, converting the -NH₂ group into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate is 4-(acetaldehyde)benzenediazonium chloride.
    2.  **H₂O:** The addition of water, typically with warming, hydrolyzes the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.
    3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group).

    ### **Step 3: Determination of the Final Product**

    This final step is the key to identifying the correct answer. An aldol reaction can result in two different products depending on the conditions.

    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule. This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde. In this case, the product would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option A.
    *   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):** The problem explicitly includes **"Heat"**. Heating an aldol addition product, especially in the presence of base, causes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration). This is a favorable process that creates a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system. The dehydration removes the -OH group from the β-carbon and a proton from the α-carbon.

    The final product is therefore the result of this dehydration. The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.

    ### **Step 4: Matching with Options**

    *   **A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated.
    *   **B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups and the double bond is in the wrong position.
    *   **C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This is not a self-condensation product.
    *   **D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This structure perfectly matches the final, dehydrated aldol *condensation* product.
