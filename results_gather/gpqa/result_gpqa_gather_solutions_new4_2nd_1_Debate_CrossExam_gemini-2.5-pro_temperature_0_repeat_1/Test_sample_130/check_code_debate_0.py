    This function checks the correctness of the answer to a complex chemistry problem.
    It models the chemical reasoning required to solve the problem:
    1. Defines the problem's knowns: reactants, reaction type, and NMR data.
    2. Models the two possible stereochemical outcomes (endo and exo isomers).
    3. Applies chemical principles (steric hindrance vs. the endo rule) to determine the major product.
    4. Determines the unique spatial proton-proton interaction (NOESY cross-peak) for the major product.
    5. Compares this derived result with the provided answer.
