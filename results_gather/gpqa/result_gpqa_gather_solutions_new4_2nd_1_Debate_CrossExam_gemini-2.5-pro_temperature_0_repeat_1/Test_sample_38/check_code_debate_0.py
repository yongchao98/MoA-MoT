def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the given quantum mechanics problem.

    The core principle is the normalization condition: ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1 over the allowed region [1, 3].
    1.  The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i.
    2.  The probability density is |ψ(x)|² = (Re(ψ))² + (Im(ψ))² = (a²/ (1 + x)) + (-0.5)² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.
    3.  The normalization integral is ∫[1,3] (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx = 1.
    4.  Solving the integral:
        a² * [ln(1+x)] from 1 to 3   +   [0.25*x] from 1 to 3 = 1
        a² * (ln(4) - ln(2))   +   (0.25*3 - 0.25*1) = 1
        a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
    5.  Solving for 'a':
        a² * ln(2) = 0.5
        a² = 0.5 / ln(2)
        a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))
