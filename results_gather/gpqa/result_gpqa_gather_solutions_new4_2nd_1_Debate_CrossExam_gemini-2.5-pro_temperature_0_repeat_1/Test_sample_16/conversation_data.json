An \"ideal pH\" implies the pH is high enough (typically >10) that the fully deprotonated EDTA⁴⁻ is the dominant form, allowing the direct use of the given K_f value without correction.\n*   **Validity of the Approximation:** The simplifying assumption (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) must be checked. Since the calculated x (6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M) is many orders of magnitude smaller than 0.02 M, the assumption is valid and avoids the need to solve a more complex quadratic equation.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** A majority of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed to match the numerical result to the correct letter option, indicating a potential mix-up of the option list.

Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form at equilibrium.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [CaY]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n5.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve:** We use the dissociation constant (K_d) and the equilibrium concentrations from the table.\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Apply a Simplifying Assumption:** Because K_d is extremely small (2 x 10⁻¹¹), the equilibrium lies far to the left, meaning very little of the complex dissociates. Therefore, 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can simplify the denominator:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n7.  **Calculate the Concentration 'x':** The simplified equation becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions is [Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Dissociation vs. Formation:** The most critical step is to recognize that since the starting material is the complex, the relevant process is dissociation. This means the calculation should be based on the dissociation reaction and its corresponding constant, K_d. Many of the provided answers correctly identified this, either by calculating K_d or by correctly arranging the K_f expression.\n*   **K_d vs. K_f:** One must use the correct equilibrium constant for the chosen reaction. Using K_d = 1/K_f for the dissociation reaction is the most direct approach.\n*   **The \"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This is a crucial simplification. The stability of the Ca-EDTA complex is highly pH-dependent. \"Ideal pH\" allows us to ignore the protonation of the free EDTA ligand (i.e., we can assume all free EDTA is Y⁴⁻) and use the given K_f value directly.\n*   **Validity of the Approximation:** The assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02 is valid because the calculated x (6.3 x 10⁻⁷) is many orders of magnitude smaller than 0.02. This check confirms the calculation method is sound.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** A significant number of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but then failed to match the numerical result (6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M) to the correct lettered option from the prompt.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points required to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Process:** The problem asks for the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], in a solution that was initially prepared as 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. This is a classic chemical equilibrium problem involving the dissociation of a stable complex.\n\n2.  **Write the Relevant Equilibrium Reaction:** Since the solution starts with the complex, the reaction that establishes equilibrium is its dissociation into its constituent ions:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant:**\n    *   The problem provides the **formation constant (K_f)**, which describes the formation of the complex: K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰. This constant is for the forward reaction: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻.\n    *   For the dissociation reaction shown in step 2, we need the **dissociation constant (K_d)**. The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    *   **Calculation:** K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n4.  **Set Up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) Table:** This table helps track the concentrations as the system moves to equilibrium. Let 'x' represent the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n5.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve:**\n    *   Using the dissociation constant K_d and the equilibrium concentrations from the table, the expression is:\n        K_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n    *   Substituting the values:\n        2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Apply a Simplifying Assumption:**\n    *   The dissociation constant (K_d = 2 x 10⁻¹¹) is extremely small. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and the complex is very stable. Therefore, the amount that dissociates, 'x', will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n    *   We can simplify the denominator: (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   The simplified equation becomes: 2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n7.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for x²:\n        x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n        x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   Solve for x by taking the square root:\n        x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Conclusion and Matching:** The calculated equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately **6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M**. Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    D) 2.0x10⁻² M\n\n    The calculated value directly matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Formation vs. Dissociation Constant:** It is crucial to use the correct equilibrium constant for the reaction being modeled. Since the calculation starts from the complex and determines how much dissociates, using the dissociation constant (K_d = 1/K_f) is the most direct method. This was a point of consensus among all correct analyses.\n*   **The \"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This is a critical simplification. The binding strength of EDTA is highly dependent on pH because the EDTA anion can be protonated at lower pH values. The \"ideal pH\" instruction allows us to assume the pH is high enough (typically >10) that the fully deprotonated EDTA⁴⁻ is the dominant form, permitting the direct use of the given K_f value without needing a pH-dependent correction (i.e., a conditional formation constant, K'f).\n*   **Validity of the Approximation:** The assumption that `x` is negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) must be valid. Here, 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ is vastly smaller than 0.02, so the approximation is justified and introduces no significant error.\n*   **Matching Result to Options:** The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while nearly all of them performed the calculation correctly to get ~6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M, their final letter choices varied widely. This indicates they were likely working with different lists of options. The most important final step is to carefully match the correct numerical result to the specific options provided in this problem.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The relevant equilibrium reaction is:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant:**\n    *   The problem provides the **formation constant** (`K_f`), which describes the formation of the complex: `K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰`.\n    *   The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction is the **dissociation constant** (`K_d`), which is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    *   `K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹`.\n\n3.  **Set Up an ICE Table:** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form at equilibrium.\n\n| Species       | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Write and Solve the Equilibrium Expression:**\n    *   The expression for the dissociation constant is: `K_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]`\n    *   Substituting the equilibrium values from the table: `2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)`\n\n5.  **Apply a Simplifying Assumption:**\n    *   Because the dissociation constant (`K_d = 2 x 10⁻¹¹`) is extremely small, the complex is very stable and only a tiny fraction will dissociate.\n    *   This means 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore simplify the denominator: `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`.\n    *   The simplified equation becomes: `2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentration of Ca²⁺:**\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for `x²`:\n        `x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02`\n        `x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³`\n    *   Take the square root to find x:\n        `x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M`\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, `[Ca²⁺]`, is `x`, which is approximately `6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Dissociation vs. Formation:** It is crucial to use the dissociation constant (`K_d`) because the reaction starts from the complex, not from the free ions.\n*   **\"Ideal pH\" Simplification:** The problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which allows us to use the given `K_f` value directly and assume that all free EDTA is in the `EDTA⁴⁻` form, avoiding more complex calculations involving pH-dependent alpha fractions.\n*   **Validity of the Approximation:** The calculated value `x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M` is vastly smaller than `0.02 M`, confirming that the simplifying assumption `(0.02 - x ≈ 0.02)` was valid.\n*   **Matching the Result to the Options:** The calculated value is `6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M`. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    B) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    C) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    D) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\n    The result correctly matches option C. Many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed to select the corresponding option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully calculated the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe calculation proceeded as follows:\n1.  The dissociation constant (`K_d`) for the reaction `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻` was determined by taking the inverse of the given formation constant (`K_f`), resulting in `K_d = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹`.\n2.  The equilibrium expression `K_d = x² / (0.02 - x)` was simplified to `K_d ≈ x² / 0.02` based on the valid assumption that the dissociation is minimal.\n3.  Solving this equation for `x` (the concentration of Ca²⁺) yielded a value of approximately `6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M`.\n\nThis calculated concentration directly corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and a list of careful points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Equilibrium:** The problem starts with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. This complex will dissociate to a small extent to reach equilibrium. The relevant chemical reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant:**\n    *   The problem provides the **formation constant (K_f)**, which corresponds to the reverse reaction: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻.\n        K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n    *   For the dissociation reaction, we need the **dissociation constant (K_d)**, which is the inverse of the formation constant.\n        K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table helps track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form at equilibrium.\n    *   **Initial:** [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M; [Ca²⁺] = 0 M; [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n    *   **Change:** [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] decreases by x; [Ca²⁺] increases by x; [EDTA⁴⁻] increases by x.\n    *   **Equilibrium:** [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x; [Ca²⁺] = x; [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve:** Using the dissociation constant K_d:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Apply a Simplifying Assumption:** Because K_d is extremely small (2 x 10⁻¹¹), the equilibrium lies far to the left, meaning very little of the complex dissociates. Therefore, 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can simplify the denominator:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n    The equation becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentration 'x':**\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Formation vs. Dissociation Constant:** It is crucial to use the correct equilibrium constant for the reaction being analyzed. Since the calculation starts from the complex and considers its dissociation, using the dissociation constant (K_d = 1/K_f) is the most direct approach. Alternatively, using the formation constant (K_f) is also valid, but the expression must be set up correctly as K_f = (0.02 - x) / x².\n*   **The \"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This is a key simplification. The binding strength of EDTA is highly pH-dependent because the EDTA anion can be protonated. An \"ideal pH\" implies the pH is high enough (typically >10) that the fully deprotonated EDTA⁴⁻ is the dominant form, allowing the direct use of the given K_f value without correction.\n*   **Validity of the Approximation:** The simplifying assumption (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) must be checked. Since the calculated x (6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M) is many orders of magnitude smaller than 0.02 M, the assumption is valid and avoids the need to solve a more complex quadratic equation.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** A majority of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed to match the numerical result to the correct letter option, indicating a potential mix-up of the option list. The numerical result is consistently ~6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option B in the original question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Process:** The problem starts with a solution of 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. To find the concentration of free calcium ions, we must consider the dissociation of this complex to reach equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Write the Relevant Equilibrium Reaction:** The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction. Let Y⁴⁻ represent the fully deprotonated EDTA anion.\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant:**\n    *   We are given the **formation constant (K_f)** for the reaction Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻, which is K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n    *   For the dissociation reaction, we need the **dissociation constant (K_d)**. This is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    *   K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n4.  **Set Up an ICE Table:** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form at equilibrium.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [CaY]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n5.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve:** We use the dissociation constant (K_d) and the equilibrium concentrations from the table.\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Apply a Simplifying Assumption:** Because K_d is extremely small (2 x 10⁻¹¹), the equilibrium lies far to the left, meaning very little of the complex dissociates. Therefore, 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can simplify the denominator:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n7.  **Calculate the Concentration 'x':** The simplified equation becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions is [Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Dissociation vs. Formation:** The most critical step is to recognize that since the starting material is the complex, the relevant process is dissociation. This means the calculation should be based on the dissociation reaction and its corresponding constant, K_d. Many of the provided answers correctly identified this, either by calculating K_d or by correctly arranging the K_f expression.\n*   **K_d vs. K_f:** One must use the correct equilibrium constant for the chosen reaction. Using K_d = 1/K_f for the dissociation reaction is the most direct approach.\n*   **The \"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This is a crucial simplification. The stability of the Ca-EDTA complex is highly pH-dependent. \"Ideal pH\" allows us to ignore the protonation of the free EDTA ligand (i.e., we can assume all free EDTA is Y⁴⁻) and use the given K_f value directly.\n*   **Validity of the Approximation:** The assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02 is valid because the calculated x (6.3 x 10⁻⁷) is many orders of magnitude smaller than 0.02. This check confirms the calculation method is sound.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** A significant number of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but then failed to match the numerical result (6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M) to the correct lettered option from the prompt. The correct match is **B**.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the calculations in the provided answers is that the concentration of Ca²⁺ is ~6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.
