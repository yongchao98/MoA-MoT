def check_correctness_of_answer():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the given physics question.

    The question asks for the formula for the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson (H2)
    generated by one-loop radiative corrections, based on the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism.

    The correctness is determined by three physical principles:
    1.  **Prefactor:** The mass-squared must be inversely proportional to the square of the
        symmetry-breaking scale, f^2 = (x^2 + v^2). So, the prefactor must contain 1/(x^2+v^2).
    2.  **Supertrace Rule (Signs):** Contributions from bosons (spin 0, 1) are positive (+M^4),
        while contributions from fermions (spin 1/2) are negative (-M^4).
    3.  **Completeness:** The formula must include all relevant heavy particles that acquire mass
        from the symmetry-breaking VEVs.
