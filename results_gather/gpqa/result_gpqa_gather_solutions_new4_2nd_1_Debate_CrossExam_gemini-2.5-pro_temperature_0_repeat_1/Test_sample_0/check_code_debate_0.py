    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the quantum energy level resolution problem.

    The core principle is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time:
    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ
    where ΔE is the energy width, τ is the lifetime, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

    To clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be significantly
    larger than their energy widths. The limiting factor is the state with the shorter
    lifetime, as it has the larger energy width.

    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying key points.

    ### Step-by-Step Analysis

    1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The fundamental concept governing this problem is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle establishes a relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state (τ) and the inherent uncertainty or "width" of its energy level (ΔE). The relationship is given by ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2, and for practical calculations, it is often approximated as:
        ΔE ≈ ħ / τ
        where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). A key takeaway is that a shorter lifetime results in a larger energy uncertainty.

    2.  **Define the Condition for Resolution**: For two energy levels to be "clearly distinguished" or "resolved," the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. The state with the larger energy width (i.e., the shorter lifetime) is the primary limiting factor. Therefore, the energy separation must be greater than the larger of the two energy widths.

    3.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**:
        *   **State 1**:
            *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s
            *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**
        *   **State 2**:
            *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s
            *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**

    4.  **Determine the Minimum Required Energy Separation**: The larger energy width belongs to State 1 (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). This is the dominant uncertainty. To clearly resolve the two levels, their energy separation must be significantly greater than this value.
        *   **Resolution Condition**: |E₁ - E₂| >> 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV

    5.  **Evaluate the Given Options**: We must compare the options provided in the question against this condition.
        *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.
        *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.
        *   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV**: This is much larger than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷).
        *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is vastly smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.

    ### Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Answers

    *   **Consistency in Physics**: Nearly all candidate answers correctly identified the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and accurately calculated the energy widths. The physical reasoning is sound and consistent across the board.
    *   **The Limiting Factor**: All detailed analyses correctly identified that the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width and is therefore the limiting factor for resolution.
    *   **Mapping Error**: The most common error among the candidate answers was not in the physics but in the final step of matching the correct numerical value (10⁻⁴ eV) to the corresponding lettered option from the original question. Several answers correctly identified 10⁻⁴ eV as the solution but then outputted <<<A>>>, <<<B>>>, or <<<D>>>, indicating a clerical error in re-listing or remembering the options.
    *   **Conclusion**: The physical analysis consistently and overwhelmingly points to 10⁻⁴ eV as the only energy difference large enough to allow the two states to be clearly resolved. This value corresponds to option C in the original question.
