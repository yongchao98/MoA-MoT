Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)\n\nA) 2 880 000 km.\nB) 3 060 000 km.\nC) 2 940 000 km.\nD) 3 000 000 km.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThis problem requires the application of the theory of special relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We want to find the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (S') is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. It is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is at rest within its own frame.\n    *   **Speed of Light (c):** We use the standard approximation `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    An observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt₀`) measured in the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the core concept of time dilation. The distance in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The relationship between the two time intervals is given by `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    The formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, we find the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, we calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    We use the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    Finally, we calculate the distance by multiplying the velocity by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / √(0.96))`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\n    Calculating the numerical value:\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Non-Relativistic Error:** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and simply calculate `d = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option (B) and is incorrect because the velocity (20% of the speed of light) is high enough for relativistic effects to be significant.\n*   **Time Dilation Direction:** Time in the stationary (Galaxy) frame is *longer* than in the moving (ejecta) frame. Therefore, the distance traveled must be *greater* than the non-relativistic answer of 3,000,000 km. This immediately rules out options B, C, and D.\n*   **Comparing with Options:** The calculated distance of approximately `3,061,862 km` is closest to option (A) `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is due to the rounding of the value in the provided option.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the calculation method and the resulting numerical value. The discrepancies in the final letter choice among the candidates are due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their responses, not a disagreement on the physics. The correct calculation points directly to the value given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires the application of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information**\n\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we need to measure the distance.\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is called the proper time because it is measured by a clock at rest relative to the event.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** We use the standard approximation `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Determine the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy's reference frame**. The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**3. Apply the Principle of Time Dilation**\n\nAccording to special relativity, a stationary observer (in the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`, will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. This effect is called time dilation.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The formula is `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    First, find the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, calculate γ:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    Using the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, about 51 seconds pass in the Galaxy.\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n    For better precision, we can use the exact formula without intermediate rounding:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) = 3,000,000 / √(0.96)`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. We compare this to the given options:\n*   A) 3,000,000 km\n*   B) 3,060,000 km\n*   C) 2,940,000 km\n*   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Proper Time:** It is crucial to identify that the 50 seconds is the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the moving object's own frame.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Contraction:** Time in the stationary frame is always longer (dilated). Therefore, the distance traveled must be greater than the non-relativistic calculation (`60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`). This logical check immediately eliminates all options except for B.\n*   **Reference Frame Consistency:** The distance in the Galaxy's frame must be calculated using the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires the application of the theory of special relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   **Speed of Light (c):** We use the standard approximation `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    An observer in the stationary Galaxy frame will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt₀`) measured in the moving ejecta frame. The distance we need to find is `d = v * Δt`.\n    The formula for time dilation is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    Now, we can find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    Finally, we calculate the distance using the velocity `v` and the dilated time `Δt`:\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Calculation Result:** The precise calculation yields a distance of approximately 3,061,862 km.\n*   **Comparing with Options:**\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n    The calculated value of 3,061,862 km is extremely close to option A (3,060,000 km).

Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is *longer* than 50 seconds, so the distance traveled must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km. Of the given options, only option A is greater than 3,000,000 km. This confirms that A is the only plausible answer.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the agents correctly identified the physics and performed the calculation, arriving at a value very close to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points identified from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The problem involves an object (supernova ejecta) moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%). Therefore, the principles of special relativity must be applied. Specifically, the phenomenon of **time dilation** is central to the solution.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference from which we need to measure the distance traveled.\n    *   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. The time given, 50 seconds, is measured within this frame.\n\n3.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time measured in the ejecta's frame, `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the **proper time** (`Δt₀` or `Δt'`) because it is measured by a clock that is at rest relative to the event it is timing.\n    *   Speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Goal:** The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy's reference frame (S)**.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Solution Path:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is calculated by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time `Δt` measured in the stationary Galaxy frame will be longer than the proper time `Δt'` measured in the moving ejecta frame.\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n6.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   **Calculate the ratio `v/c`:**\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   **Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:**\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    *   **Calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame:**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   **Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame:**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\n    The calculated value is closest to option A. The small difference of ~1,862 km (about 0.06%) is expected, as the options are likely rounded for a multiple-choice question.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proper Time Identification:** It is crucial to recognize that the 50 seconds is the proper time (`Δt'`) because it's measured in the moving frame of the ejecta. A common mistake is to use this time directly in the stationary frame's distance calculation.\n*   **Non-Relativistic Error:** Simply calculating `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option B) ignores the effects of special relativity and is incorrect.\n*   **Direction of Time Dilation:** Time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is always *longer* than the proper time (`Δt'`). This means the distance traveled in the stationary frame must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km. This logical check immediately eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving only A as a plausible answer.\n*   **Consistency Check (Length Contraction):** As one agent noted, the problem can also be solved from the ejecta's perspective using length contraction. The distance the ejecta needs to cover (`d`) is a proper length in the Galaxy's frame. From the ejecta's frame, this distance appears contracted to `d' = d / γ`. The ejecta sees this contracted distance go by in its proper time `Δt'`. So, `d' = v * Δt'`. Combining these gives `d / γ = v * Δt'`, which rearranges to `d = v * γ * Δt'`. This is the exact same formula as derived from the time dilation perspective, confirming the method's correctness.\n\nThe final answer is derived from a consistent application of the time dilation formula, with the calculation yielding a value extremely close to one of the options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity that requires the application of the time dilation principle.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The goal is to find the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (measured by a clock on the ejecta) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is called the \"proper time\".\n    *   **Speed of Light (c):** We use the standard approximation `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Principle:**\n    The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is given by `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame. Due to the effects of special relativity, time for a moving object appears to pass more slowly when viewed from a stationary frame. This is called **time dilation**.

The small difference is expected as the options in such problems are often rounded.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers\nMost of the provided candidate answers correctly identify the physics and perform the calculation accurately. However, many of them select the wrong final letter (e.g., A, B, or C) because they seem to be working from a scrambled list of options.

This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock at rest relative to the event being timed.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** We will use the standard approximation `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. The Core Concept: Time Dilation**\nAccording to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This means the time interval measured in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`, will be longer than the proper time, `Δt₀`. The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n**3. The Calculation Steps**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the non-relativistic distance for a sanity check.**\n    If we ignored relativity, the distance would be `d = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option B. Because of time dilation, we know the time in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is longer than 50 s, so the actual distance must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km. This immediately eliminates options A, B, and D, strongly suggesting C is the correct answer.\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor quantifies the effect of time dilation.\n    The formula is: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    The formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    `Δt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    As expected, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds.\n\n*   **Step D: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the same frame.\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n**4.

This requires applying the principles of special relativity.\n\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame), `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the **proper time**.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is taken to be `300,000 km/s`.\n\n*   **Goal:**\n    *   Find the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's frame).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Correct Physical Principle\n\nTo find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, we need the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). Because the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame will be longer than the time measured in the ejecta's frame. This phenomenon is called **time dilation**.\n\nThe distance is calculated as `d = v * Δt`.\n\nThe time dilation formula is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, substitute this into the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n2.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n3.  **Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame:**\n    `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n    For a more precise calculation without intermediate rounding:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = 60,000 * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 ) = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Analyze Candidate Answers\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. We must compare this to the original options:\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km\n*   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**, which is **Option A**.\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Errors\n\n1.  **Correct Physics:** All candidate answers correctly identify that time dilation is the necessary principle. Their step-by-step calculations are universally correct.\n2.  **Classical Physics Trap:** The non-relativistic (and incorrect) answer would be `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which is Option C. Since time dilates (gets longer) in the stationary frame, the distance must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km. This simple check immediately eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving only A as a plausible answer.\n3.  **Option Labeling Confusion:** The primary source of error among the candidate answers is inconsistent labeling of the options. For example, Answer 1 correctly calculates the value and identifies 3,060,000 km as the answer, but mistakenly calls it \"option D\" and outputs `<<<D>>>`. Answer 2 calls it \"option C\" and outputs `<<<C>>>`. This is a recurring error. The reasoning in almost every case points to the numerical value 3,060,000 km, but the final letter chosen is often wrong due to this labeling mix-up.\n\nBased on a correct application of physics and a careful comparison to the original problem's option list, the answer is 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points to ensure accuracy.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Physics Principle**\nThe problem involves an object (supernova ejecta) moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 60,000 km/s, which is 20% of the speed of light, c). Therefore, the laws of classical mechanics are insufficient, and the principles of Einstein's special relativity must be used. The key concept here is **time dilation**.\n\n**2. Identify the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is treated as the \"stationary\" frame of reference. The question asks for the distance as measured from this frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. The time of 50 seconds is measured within this frame.\n\n**3. Identify and Define the Given Quantities**\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is a crucial point. The time measured in the moving object's own frame is called the proper time. A common mistake is to confuse this with the time measured by the stationary observer.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** We will use the standard approximation `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**4. Determine the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for this is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**5. Apply the Time Dilation Formula**\nTime dilation dictates that a stationary observer measures more time passing for a moving object than the object measures for itself. The formula is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**6. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n    The formula for the Lorentz factor is `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    First, find the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light:\n    `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, calculate γ:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt)**\n    This is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy measures about 51.031 seconds passing.\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the Distance (d)**\n    Now, use the time from the Galaxy's frame to calculate the distance in that same frame.\n    `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**7. Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Let's compare this to the given options:\n*   A) 3,000,000 km: This is the incorrect non-relativistic answer (`60,000 km/s * 50 s`).\n*   B) 2,940,000 km: Incorrect. This would result from mistakenly contracting time instead of dilating it.\n*   C) 2,880,000 km: Incorrect.\n*   D) 3,060,000 km: This value is the closest to our calculated result. The minor difference is due to the rounding of the value in the problem's options.\n\n**Careful Point (Sanity Check):**\nBecause of time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be *longer* than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the distance traveled as seen from the Galaxy must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km. Of the choices provided, only 3,060,000 km is greater than 3,000,000 km, confirming our answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Problem\n*   **Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames. The \"stationary\" frame is the Galaxy, and the \"moving\" frame is the supernova ejecta.\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity (`v`): 60,000 km/s.\n    *   Time in the moving frame (proper time, `Δt₀`): 50 s.\n    *   Speed of light (`c`): We will use the standard approximation of 300,000 km/s.\n*   **Objective:** Find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n### 2. Core Physical Principle\nThe problem involves a velocity that is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`). Therefore, the principles of special relativity must be applied. Specifically, the phenomenon of **time dilation** is central to the solution. Time dilation dictates that an observer in a stationary frame will measure a longer time interval for an event occurring in a moving frame compared to an observer in the moving frame.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):** This factor quantifies the magnitude of relativistic effects.\n    *   The formula is: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`: `60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, substitute this into the formula: `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    *   Calculating the value gives `γ ≈ 1.02062`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):** This is the \"dilated time\".\n    *   The formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   `Δt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy measures that about 51.031 seconds have passed.\n\n3.  **Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the same frame.\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n4.  **Alternative (more precise) calculation:** To avoid rounding errors, we can combine the steps.\n    *   `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(0.96)`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### 4. Analysis of Options and Careful Points\n*   **Option A) 2,940,000 km:** Incorrect. This might result from incorrectly applying the Lorentz factor (e.g., multiplying by `√(0.96)` instead of dividing).\n*   **Option B) 3,060,000 km:** The calculated value of `~3,061,862 km` is extremely close to this option. The small difference is attributable to rounding in the problem's options.\n*   **Option C) 2,880,000 km:** Incorrect.\n*   **Option D) 3,000,000 km:** This is the **non-relativistic answer** (`60,000 km/s * 50 s`). It is a common mistake to ignore time dilation. Since we know time dilates (more time passes in the Galaxy frame), the distance must be *greater* than this value. This logical check immediately invalidates options A, C, and D, leaving B as the only possible correct answer.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculation based on the principles of special relativity yields a distance of approximately 3,061,862 km. This value is closest to option B. Furthermore, a logical check confirms that the relativistic distance must be greater than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km, making option B the only plausible choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a problem of special relativity that requires the application of the time dilation principle. All candidate answers correctly identify the core physics and the necessary formulas. The final decision rests on a careful and precise execution of the calculation and comparison with the given options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (v):** 60,000 km/s.\n    *   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (S') is 50 s.

The formula for this is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n3.  **Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\n    According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt₀`) measured in the moving frame (S'). This is time dilation, described by the formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    Now, we find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    Finally, we calculate the distance using the velocity and the time measured in the Galaxy's frame:\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\n    To get the numerical value:\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.979796 km ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.

Therefore, the distance traveled must be greater than the non-relativistic calculation (`60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`). This logical check immediately eliminates options B, C, and D.\n*   **Frame Consistency:** The distance in the Galaxy's frame must be calculated using the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n*   **Rounding:** The minor discrepancy between the calculated value (~3,061,862 km) and the correct option (3,060,000 km) is due to the options being rounded values, which is common in physics problems.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same conclusion, despite some inconsistencies in how they labeled the final options.

Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Realize the need for Time Dilation.**\n    To find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, we must use the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). We cannot simply use the 50 seconds from the ejecta's frame. According to time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval than the proper time measured in the moving frame (ejecta).\n    The formula is: `d = v * Δt`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor `γ` quantifies the time dilation effect.\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt) in the Galaxy's Frame.**\n    The time dilation formula is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    `Δt = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Distance (d) in the Galaxy's Frame.**\n    Now, substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n    To get the numerical value:\n    `√(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**5.

The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The relationship between the two time intervals is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    The formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, we find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, we calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt):**\n    Now, we find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    Finally, we calculate the distance by multiplying the velocity by the time measured in the Galaxy's frame:\n    `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n    Alternatively, we can calculate without intermediate rounding:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²) = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option B.\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proper Time:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the 50 seconds is the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the rest frame of the moving object (the ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Contraction:** Time for a moving object, as seen by a stationary observer, always slows down, meaning the duration measured by the stationary observer (`Δt`) is *longer* than the proper time (`Δt₀`).\n*   **Non-Relativistic Check:** If we ignore relativity, the distance would be `d = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option C). Since time dilation causes the time in the Galaxy's frame to be longer than 50 s, the distance traveled must be greater than 3,000,000 km. This immediately eliminates options C and D.\n*   **Intended Answer:** Using a common approximation for the Lorentz factor (`γ ≈ 1 + v²/2c²`) gives `γ ≈ 1 + 0.2²/2 = 1.02`. This leads to a dilated time of `Δt = 1.02 * 50 s = 51 s`, and a distance of `d = 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km`. This exactly matches option B, suggesting this approximation might have been the intended method for solving the problem.\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km, which is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, taking into account the provided candidate answers and identifying the key points for a correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle**: The problem involves a scenario where one frame of reference (the supernova ejecta) is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to another (the Galaxy). This requires the application of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, specifically the concept of **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference**:\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S)**: This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we need to measure the distance.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S')**: This is the \"moving\" frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured here.\n\n3.  **List the Given Information**:\n    *   Relative velocity (`v`): 60,000 km/s\n    *   Proper time (`Δt₀`): 50 s. This is the time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock). It is called \"proper time\" because the clock is at rest in its own frame.\n    *   Speed of light (`c`): Assumed to be 300,000 km/s for this problem.\n\n4.  **Determine the Goal**: The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy's reference frame**.\n\n### Careful Points and Calculation\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Choosing the Right Time.** The distance in the Galaxy's frame must be calculated using the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`), not the time from the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`). The formula is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Non-Relativistic Trap.** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and simply multiply the velocity by the given time: `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option **C** and is incorrect because it fails to account for time dilation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Applying Time Dilation.** Time dilation dictates that a stationary observer (in the Galaxy) measures more time passing than an observer in the moving frame (the ejecta). The formula is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor. Since `γ` is always greater than 1 for a moving object, `Δt` will be greater than `Δt₀`. This means the distance measured in the Galaxy frame must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**. This logical step alone eliminates options A, C, and D, leaving only B.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: The Full Calculation.** To confirm, we perform the full calculation:\n    1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n        The ratio `v/c` is `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`.\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n    2.  **Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    3.  **Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / √(0.96))`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.

This is the **proper time** (`Δt₀` or `Δt'`) because it is measured by a clock that is at rest relative to the event it is timing.\n    *   Speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Goal:** The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy's reference frame (S)**.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Solution Path:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is calculated by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time `Δt` measured in the stationary Galaxy frame will be longer than the proper time `Δt'` measured in the moving ejecta frame.\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n6.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   **Calculate the ratio `v/c`:**\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   **Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:**\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    *   **Calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame:**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   **Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame:**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\n    The calculated value is closest to option A. The small difference of ~1,862 km (about 0.06%) is expected, as the options are likely rounded for a multiple-choice question.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proper Time Identification:** It is crucial to recognize that the 50 seconds is the proper time (`Δt'`) because it's measured in the moving frame of the ejecta. A common mistake is to use this time directly in the stationary frame's distance calculation.\n*   **Non-Relativistic Error:** Simply calculating `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option B) ignores the effects of special relativity and is incorrect.\n*   **Direction of Time Dilation:** Time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is always *longer* than the proper time (`Δt'`). This means the distance traveled in the stationary frame must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km. This logical check immediately eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving only A as a plausible answer.\n*   **Consistency Check (Length Contraction):** As one agent noted, the problem can also be solved from the ejecta's perspective using length contraction. The distance the ejecta needs to cover (`d`) is a proper length in the Galaxy's frame. From the ejecta's frame, this distance appears contracted to `d' = d / γ`. The ejecta sees this contracted distance go by in its proper time `Δt'`. So, `d' = v * Δt'`. Combining these gives `d / γ = v * Δt'`, which rearranges to `d = v * γ * Δt'`. This is the exact same formula as derived from the time dilation perspective, confirming the method's correctness.\n\nThe final answer is derived from a consistent application of the time dilation formula, with the calculation yielding a value extremely close to one of the options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity that requires the application of the time dilation principle.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The goal is to find the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (measured by a clock on the ejecta) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`.

Due to the effects of special relativity, time for a moving object appears to pass more slowly when viewed from a stationary frame. This is called **time dilation**. Therefore, the time `Δt` measured in the Galaxy's frame will be longer than the proper time `Δt₀`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    The relationship between the two time intervals is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    Combining the formulas, the distance `d` is:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, substitute this into the combined formula:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - 0.2²)`\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04)`\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)`\n    *   The code output confirms the numerical result: `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km (This is the incorrect non-relativistic answer, obtained by ignoring time dilation).\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\n    The calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to **3,060,000 km**. The small difference is expected as the options in such problems are often rounded.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers\nMost of the provided candidate answers correctly identify the physics and perform the calculation accurately. However, many of them select the wrong final letter (e.g., A, B, or C) because they seem to be working from a scrambled list of options. The calculation consistently points to a value near 3,060,000 km, which corresponds to option D in the original question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe code execution confirms the result of the manual calculation.\n\n1.  **Problem:** We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n2.  **Method:** This requires using the time dilation formula from special relativity.\n    *   The time measured in the ejecta's frame (the moving frame) is the proper time, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The time measured in the Galaxy's frame (the stationary frame), `Δt`, will be longer due to time dilation.\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n3.  **Calculation:** The code performed the following calculation:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n    `d = 60,000 * (1 / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²)) * 50`\n4.  **Result:** The code output shows the calculated distance is `3,061,862.178... km`.\n5.  **Comparison with Options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of **3,061,862 km** is extremely close to option **C) 3,060,000 km**. The minor difference is due to the options being rounded.\n\nTherefore, based on the precise calculation confirmed by the code, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires the application of the theory of special relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We need to find the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock at rest relative to the event being timed.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** We will use the standard approximation `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. The Core Concept: Time Dilation**\nAccording to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This means the time interval measured in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`, will be longer than the proper time, `Δt₀`. The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n**3. The Calculation Steps**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the non-relativistic distance for a sanity check.**\n    If we ignored relativity, the distance would be `d = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option B. Because of time dilation, we know the time in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is longer than 50 s, so the actual distance must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km. This immediately eliminates options A, B, and D, strongly suggesting C is the correct answer.\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor quantifies the effect of time dilation.\n    The formula is: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    The formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    `Δt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    As expected, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds.\n\n*   **Step D: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the same frame.\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n**4. Compare the Result with the Options**\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,860 km`.\n*   A) 2,880,000 km\n*   B) 3,000,000 km\n*   C) 3,060,000 km\n*   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows a consensus on the calculation method and the numerical result. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to the options being presented in a different order. Based on the options provided in the question, the correct calculation leads to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Physics Problem\n\nThe core of the question is to calculate a distance traveled at a relativistic speed. This requires applying the principles of special relativity.\n\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame), `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the **proper time**.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is taken to be `300,000 km/s`.\n\n*   **Goal:**\n    *   Find the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's frame).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Correct Physical Principle\n\nTo find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, we need the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). Because the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame will be longer than the time measured in the ejecta's frame. This phenomenon is called **time dilation**.\n\nThe distance is calculated as `d = v * Δt`.\n\nThe time dilation formula is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, substitute this into the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n2.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n3.  **Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame:**\n    `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n    For a more precise calculation without intermediate rounding:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = 60,000 * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 ) = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Analyze Candidate Answers\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. We must compare this to the original options:\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km\n*   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**, which is **Option A**.\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Errors\n\n1.  **Correct Physics:** All candidate answers correctly identify that time dilation is the necessary principle. Their step-by-step calculations are universally correct.\n2.  **Classical Physics Trap:** The non-relativistic (and incorrect) answer would be `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which is Option C. Since time dilates (gets longer) in the stationary frame, the distance must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km. This simple check immediately eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving only A as a plausible answer.\n3.  **Option Labeling Confusion:** The primary source of error among the candidate answers is inconsistent labeling of the options. For example, Answer 1 correctly calculates the value and identifies 3,060,000 km as the answer, but mistakenly calls it \"option D\" and outputs `<<<D>>>`. Answer 2 calls it \"option C\" and outputs `<<<C>>>`. This is a recurring error. The reasoning in almost every case points to the numerical value 3,060,000 km, but the final letter chosen is often wrong due to this labeling mix-up.\n\nBased on a correct application of physics and a careful comparison to the original problem's option list, the answer is 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points to ensure accuracy.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Physics Principle**\nThe problem involves an object (supernova ejecta) moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 60,000 km/s, which is 20% of the speed of light, c). Therefore, the laws of classical mechanics are insufficient, and the principles of Einstein's special relativity must be used. The key concept here is **time dilation**.\n\n**2. Identify the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is treated as the \"stationary\" frame of reference. The question asks for the distance as measured from this frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. The time of 50 seconds is measured within this frame.\n\n**3. Identify and Define the Given Quantities**\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is a crucial point. The time measured in the moving object's own frame is called the proper time. A common mistake is to confuse this with the time measured by the stationary observer.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** We will use the standard approximation `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**4. Determine the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for this is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**5. Apply the Time Dilation Formula**\nTime dilation dictates that a stationary observer measures more time passing for a moving object than the object measures for itself. The formula is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**6. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n    The formula for the Lorentz factor is `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    First, find the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light:\n    `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, calculate γ:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt)**\n    This is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy measures about 51.031 seconds passing.\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the Distance (d)**\n    Now, use the time from the Galaxy's frame to calculate the distance in that same frame.\n    `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**7. Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Let's compare this to the given options:\n*   A) 3,000,000 km: This is the incorrect non-relativistic answer (`60,000 km/s * 50 s`).\n*   B) 2,940,000 km: Incorrect. This would result from mistakenly contracting time instead of dilating it.\n*   C) 2,880,000 km: Incorrect.\n*   D) 3,060,000 km: This value is the closest to our calculated result. The minor difference is due to the rounding of the value in the problem's options.\n\n**Careful Point (Sanity Check):**\nBecause of time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be *longer* than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the distance traveled as seen from the Galaxy must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km. Of the choices provided, only 3,060,000 km is greater than 3,000,000 km, confirming our answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Problem\n*   **Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames. The \"stationary\" frame is the Galaxy, and the \"moving\" frame is the supernova ejecta.\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity (`v`): 60,000 km/s.\n    *   Time in the moving frame (proper time, `Δt₀`): 50 s.\n    *   Speed of light (`c`): We will use the standard approximation of 300,000 km/s.\n*   **Objective:** Find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n### 2. Core Physical Principle\nThe problem involves a velocity that is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`). Therefore, the principles of special relativity must be applied. Specifically, the phenomenon of **time dilation** is central to the solution. Time dilation dictates that an observer in a stationary frame will measure a longer time interval for an event occurring in a moving frame compared to an observer in the moving frame.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):** This factor quantifies the magnitude of relativistic effects.\n    *   The formula is: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`: `60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, substitute this into the formula: `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    *   Calculating the value gives `γ ≈ 1.02062`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):** This is the \"dilated time\".\n    *   The formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   `Δt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy measures that about 51.031 seconds have passed.\n\n3.  **Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the same frame.\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n4.  **Alternative (more precise) calculation:** To avoid rounding errors, we can combine the steps.\n    *   `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(0.96)`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### 4. Analysis of Options and Careful Points\n*   **Option A) 2,940,000 km:** Incorrect. This might result from incorrectly applying the Lorentz factor (e.g., multiplying by `√(0.96)` instead of dividing).\n*   **Option B) 3,060,000 km:** The calculated value of `~3,061,862 km` is extremely close to this option. The small difference is attributable to rounding in the problem's options.\n*   **Option C) 2,880,000 km:** Incorrect.\n*   **Option D) 3,000,000 km:** This is the **non-relativistic answer** (`60,000 km/s * 50 s`). It is a common mistake to ignore time dilation. Since we know time dilates (more time passes in the Galaxy frame), the distance must be *greater* than this value. This logical check immediately invalidates options A, C, and D, leaving B as the only possible correct answer.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculation based on the principles of special relativity yields a distance of approximately 3,061,862 km. This value is closest to option B. Furthermore, a logical check confirms that the relativistic distance must be greater than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km, making option B the only plausible choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a problem of special relativity that requires the application of the time dilation principle.

This is time dilation, described by the formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    Now, we find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    Finally, we calculate the distance using the velocity and the time measured in the Galaxy's frame:\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\n    To get the numerical value:\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.979796 km ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.

Therefore, the distance traveled must be greater than the non-relativistic calculation (`60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`). This logical check immediately eliminates options B, C, and D.\n*   **Frame Consistency:** The distance in the Galaxy's frame must be calculated using the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n*   **Rounding:** The minor discrepancy between the calculated value (~3,061,862 km) and the correct option (3,060,000 km) is due to the options being rounded values, which is common in physics problems.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same conclusion, despite some inconsistencies in how they labeled the final options. The physics and the numerical result are sound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Physics Principle**\nThe problem involves two inertial frames of reference moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 60,000 km/s, which is 20% of the speed of light). This scenario requires the application of Einstein's theory of special relativity, specifically the concept of **time dilation**.\n\n**2. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we need to measure the distance.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is called the proper time because it's measured by a clock at rest relative to the event being timed.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** We'll use the standard approximation `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**3. Determine the Goal**\nThe question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy's reference frame (S)**.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Realize the need for Time Dilation.**\n    To find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, we must use the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). We cannot simply use the 50 seconds from the ejecta's frame. According to time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval than the proper time measured in the moving frame (ejecta).\n    The formula is: `d = v * Δt`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor `γ` quantifies the time dilation effect.\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt) in the Galaxy's Frame.**\n    The time dilation formula is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    `Δt = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Distance (d) in the Galaxy's Frame.**\n    Now, substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n    To get the numerical value:\n    `√(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Final Check**\n\n*   The calculated distance is `~3,061,862 km`.\n*   Let's look at the options:\n    A) 2,940,000 km\n    B) 2,880,000 km\n    C) 3,060,000 km\n    D) 3,000,000 km\n\n*   The calculated value is extremely close to option C. The minor difference is due to rounding in the option itself.\n\n*   **Careful Point (Sanity Check):** If we ignore relativity, the distance would be `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This is option D. Because of time dilation, we know that more time passes in the Galaxy's frame than in the ejecta's frame (`Δt > 50 s`). Therefore, the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km. Looking at the options, only option C is greater than 3,000,000 km. This confirms our choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a problem of special relativity that requires the application of time dilation.

The only variation among the answers is the letter assigned to the correct option, which is an artifact of how the options were presented to each agent.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to confirm the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The **Galaxy's frame** is the stationary frame of reference (S).\n    *   The **ejecta's frame** is the moving frame of reference (S').\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Proper time (time in the moving frame S'), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   Speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   Find the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's stationary frame (S).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proper Time vs. Dilated Time:** The 50 seconds is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it's measured by a clock moving with the ejecta. The distance in the Galaxy's frame must be calculated using the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`), which is the \"dilated time\".\n*   **Time Dilation Effect:** Due to relativity, an observer in the Galaxy's frame will measure a time interval `Δt` that is *longer* than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame.\n*   **Avoiding the Classical Error:** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and calculate `d = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option **B** and is incorrect because the ejecta's speed (20% of the speed of light) is high enough for relativistic effects to be significant.\n*   **Correct Formula Application:** The distance in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`. The dilated time `Δt` is found using the Lorentz factor `γ` in the formula `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n\n### Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    The formula is `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`: `60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`.\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`: `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`.\n    *   `γ ≈ 1.02062`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the dilated time (Δt):**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`.\n    So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, about 51 seconds pass in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n3.  **Calculate the distance (d):**\n    *   `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n    Alternatively, combining the steps without intermediate rounding:\n    *   `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²) = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.

While 50 seconds passed in the ejecta's frame (proper time), the dilated time in the Galaxy's frame was found to be approximately 51.031 seconds.\n3.  **Distance Calculation**: The final step was to calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame by multiplying the velocity by the dilated time (`60,000 km/s * 51.031 s`). This resulted in a distance of approximately 3,061,862 km.\n4.  **Conclusion**: When compared with the provided multiple-choice options, the calculated distance of 3,061,862 km is closest to option D, which is 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis is a problem of special relativity, specifically concerning time dilation. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We want to find the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. It is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock at rest relative to the event being measured.\n    *   **Speed of Light (c):** We will use the standard approximation `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Concept of Time Dilation:**\n    According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt₀`) measured in the moving frame (S'). This is known as time dilation. The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The relationship between the two time intervals is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    The formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, we find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, we calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt):**\n    Now, we find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    Finally, we calculate the distance by multiplying the velocity by the time measured in the Galaxy's frame:\n    `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n    Alternatively, we can calculate without intermediate rounding:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²) = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option B.\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proper Time:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the 50 seconds is the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the rest frame of the moving object (the ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Contraction:** Time for a moving object, as seen by a stationary observer, always slows down, meaning the duration measured by the stationary observer (`Δt`) is *longer* than the proper time (`Δt₀`).\n*   **Non-Relativistic Check:** If we ignore relativity, the distance would be `d = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option C). Since time dilation causes the time in the Galaxy's frame to be longer than 50 s, the distance traveled must be greater than 3,000,000 km. This immediately eliminates options C and D.\n*   **Intended Answer:** Using a common approximation for the Lorentz factor (`γ ≈ 1 + v²/2c²`) gives `γ ≈ 1 + 0.2²/2 = 1.02`. This leads to a dilated time of `Δt = 1.02 * 50 s = 51 s`, and a distance of `d = 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km`. This exactly matches option B, suggesting this approximation might have been the intended method for solving the problem.\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km, which is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, taking into account the provided candidate answers and identifying the key points for a correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle**: The problem involves a scenario where one frame of reference (the supernova ejecta) is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to another (the Galaxy). This requires the application of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, specifically the concept of **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference**:\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S)**: This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we need to measure the distance.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S')**: This is the \"moving\" frame.

The formula is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Non-Relativistic Trap.** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and simply multiply the velocity by the given time: `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option **C** and is incorrect because it fails to account for time dilation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Applying Time Dilation.** Time dilation dictates that a stationary observer (in the Galaxy) measures more time passing than an observer in the moving frame (the ejecta). The formula is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor. Since `γ` is always greater than 1 for a moving object, `Δt` will be greater than `Δt₀`. This means the distance measured in the Galaxy frame must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.
