    This function checks the correctness of the final answer to the exoplanet temperature ratio problem.

    It follows these steps:
    1.  Defines the given orbital period ratios for the planets.
    2.  Defines the multiple-choice options as presented in the final analysis.
    3.  Defines the final answer selected by the LLM.
    4.  Performs the calculation based on the derived physical relationship: T_ratio = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).
    5.  Parses the numerical value from the selected answer option.
    6.  Compares the calculated value with the option's value to check for correctness.
