    This function checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer for a chemistry problem.
    It follows a step-by-step logical deduction based on the problem's data.
    
    1.  It analyzes the spectral data (IR and NMR) to identify the starting material.
    2.  It determines the expected product based on the chemical reaction (reduction with Red P/HI).
    3.  It matches the expected product to the given multiple-choice options.
    4.  It compares the derived correct option with the provided answer.
