    # The question asks for the correct reagent A and catalyst B for the reaction:
    # 3-methylpyrrolidine + A --(B, Heat)--> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine

    # --- Chemical Knowledge & Logic ---

    # 1. Determine the correct Reagent A based on the reaction type and product structure.
    # The reaction is an enamine synthesis from a secondary amine (3-methylpyrrolidine).
    # This reaction requires a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or a ketone).
    # 'vinylcyclohexane' is an alkene, not a carbonyl compound, so it's incorrect.
    # 'cyclohexanecarbaldehyde' is an aldehyde (a carbonyl compound).
    # Retrosynthesis of the product '1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine' confirms
    # that the required carbonyl compound is indeed 'cyclohexanecarbaldehyde'.
    correct_reagent_A = 'cyclohexanecarbaldehyde'
    
    # 2. Determine the most suitable Catalyst B.
    # The reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration, driven by heat.
    # The catalyst's role is to facilitate the removal of a water molecule.
    # TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) is a strong organic acid, which is a standard and highly
    # effective catalyst for such dehydration reactions.
    # Acetic acid is a weak acid and is generally less effective and slower than TsOH for
    # driving this reaction to completion, especially with heat.
    # Therefore, TsOH is the more suitable catalyst.
    most_suitable_catalyst_B = 'TsOH'
