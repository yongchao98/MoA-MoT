def check_entropy_calculation():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the calculated black hole entropy.

    The function follows these steps:
    1. Defines necessary physical constants in SI units.
    2. Converts the given distance (parsecs) and angular size (degrees) to SI units (meters and radians).
    3. Calculates the physical diameter and then the radius of the event horizon. This step explicitly checks the common "diameter vs. radius" error.
    4. Calculates the area of the event horizon.
    5. Calculates the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy using the area.
    6. Determines the order of magnitude of the calculated entropy.
    7. Compares the calculated order of magnitude with the one from the provided answer.
