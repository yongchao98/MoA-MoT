    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the radioactive decay problem.

    The problem is solved as follows:
    1.  The core principle is that radioactive decay is a "memoryless" process. The 50 minutes that have passed are irrelevant.
    2.  We are given that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so P(decay, 100) = 0.32.
    3.  This means the survival probability for 100 minutes is S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.
    4.  The survival probability follows S(t) = exp(-Î»t).
    5.  We need to find the decay probability in 150 minutes, P(decay, 150). This is 1 - S(150).
    6.  We can find S(150) using the relationship S(150) = S(100)^(150/100).
    7.  S(150) = 0.68 ^ 1.5.
    8.  P(decay, 150) = 1 - (0.68 ^ 1.5).
    9.  The result is compared to the provided options.
