def check_synchrocyclotron_revolutions():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the calculated number of revolutions for a proton in a synchrocyclotron.

    The calculation is based on the following principles:
    1. The total number of revolutions (N) is the total kinetic energy gained (T_final) divided by the energy gained per revolution (ΔT_rev).
    2. The proton undergoes two accelerations per revolution.
    3. The energy gained per acceleration is not maximum but depends on the synchronous phase (Φs), given as Φ₀.
    4. Energy gain per revolution (ΔT_rev) = 2 * e * U₀ * cos(Φs), where 'e' is the elementary charge.
