A careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed reaction sequence is necessary, paying close attention to the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution, including directing effects and steric hindrance.\n\n**Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  Ethoxy (-OEt) at C1: A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  tert-Butyl (-tBu) at C2: A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky.\n    3.  Nitro (-NO₂) at C3: A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Structural Features:** The three substituents are on adjacent carbons (a 1,2,3-pattern). This is a sterically crowded arrangement. The strongly activating -OEt group is *meta* to the deactivating -NO₂ group, which is a difficult arrangement to achieve via direct substitution and suggests a more complex synthetic route involving functional group manipulation.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option for chemical validity.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is chemically flawed. Step (iii) produces a sulfonic acid derivative of nitro-tert-butylbenzene. This molecule does not contain a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). Step (iv) uses NaNO₂/HCl, the reagent for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine to react. Therefore, this sequence is impossible as written.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence is also chemically flawed. Steps (i) and (ii) correctly synthesize aniline from benzene. However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is known to fail because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring, preventing the desired alkylation. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence contains a chemically nonsensical step. After forming a diazonium salt in step (v), step (vi) attempts to nitrate it using HNO₃/H₂SO₄. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates; they would not survive these harsh nitrating conditions and this is not a standard synthetic transformation. Therefore, this sequence is invalid.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This sequence presents a chemically logical pathway to the target molecule, although it has a notable limitation.\n    1.  **i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene:** A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  **ii) tert-Butylbenzene → o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming nitro group to the *ortho* and *para* positions. The *para* isomer is the major product due to less steric hindrance. To proceed, the minor *ortho* isomer must be separated. This step prevents the overall synthesis from being truly \"high-yield,\" but it is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → 2-tert-butylaniline:** The nitro group is reduced to a primary amine using Fe/HCl.\n    4.  **iv) 2-tert-butylaniline → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the crucial step to establish the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). This ion is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, making this a feasible transformation.\n    5.  **v) 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline → Diazonium salt:** The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) Diazonium salt → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol by heating in aqueous acid.\n    7.  **vii) 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ethoxy ether product.\n    8.  **viii & ix:** The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are superfluous as they are listed after the target molecule has already been synthesized. They are likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible steps and are therefore incorrect. Option C describes a sequence of reactions that is entirely plausible and leads directly to the desired product. While the yield of the second step is not ideal, it is the only chemically valid pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Such adjacent substitution patterns are often challenging to synthesize.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt (ethoxy): Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu (tert-butyl): Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro): Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Relationship:** The strongly activating -OEt group is *meta* to the deactivating -NO2 group. This arrangement is difficult to achieve by direct nitration of a precursor containing the ethoxy group, suggesting a more complex strategy involving functional group manipulation is required.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence to identify any chemically impossible steps or pathways that lead to the wrong product.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    1.  Steps (i) and (ii) correctly synthesize aniline from benzene.\n    2.  Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline. This deactivates the ring and prevents the desired alkylation.\n    3.  **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect because it contains a chemically non-viable step.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    1.  This sequence attempts to use the diazotization reagent `NaNO2/HCl` in step (iv).\n    2.  Diazotization is a reaction specific to primary aromatic amines (-NH₂). The intermediate formed after steps (i), (ii), and (iii) is a nitrated and sulfonated version of tert-butylbenzene, which does not contain an amino group.\n    3.  **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect because it applies a reagent to an intermediate that cannot react with it.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    1.  Steps (i) through (v) outline a valid strategy: alkylation, blocking the para position with a sulfonyl group, nitration, reduction of the nitro group to an amine, and finally diazotization of that amine.\n    2.  However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate the diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; reacting them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or logical synthetic step. They are typically used immediately for replacement reactions.\n    3.  **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect because it contains a chemically nonsensical step.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    1.  **i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  **ii) tert-butylbenzene → o/p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration. To achieve the final 1,2,3-pattern, the synthesis must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. While this is not a high-yield step, it is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → 2-tert-butylaniline:** Standard reduction of the nitro group.\n    4.  **iv) 2-tert-butylaniline → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the crucial step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). This group is a *meta*-director, directing the incoming nitro group to position 3. This correctly establishes the 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n    5.  **v) 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline → Diazonium salt:** Standard diazotization of the primary amine.\n    6.  **vi) Diazonium salt → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces the -N₂⁺ group with an -OH group.\n    7.  **vii) 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ethoxy ether product.\n    8.  **viii) & ix):** The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are nonsensical as they are placed after the target molecule has already been formed. They are likely included as distractors.\n    9.  **Conclusion:** The core sequence of reactions (i through vii) in Option B is a chemically logical and valid pathway that leads to the desired product. It is the only option that does not contain a fundamentally impossible chemical step.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nWhile Option B is not a perfect \"high-yield\" synthesis due to the initial nitration step and contains two superfluous steps at the end, it is the only sequence among the choices that is chemically viable and leads to the correct target molecule. The other options are invalidated by chemically impossible steps.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Positions:** The substituents are on adjacent carbons in a 1,2,3-pattern.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:**\n    *   The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the deactivating group (-NO2).\n    *   The bulky -tBu group is *ortho* to both the -OEt and -NO2 groups.\n\nThis substitution pattern is sterically crowded and electronically challenging to achieve through simple electrophilic aromatic substitution. A direct nitration of a precursor containing an ethoxy group would not place the nitro group at the meta position. This indicates that a more complex strategy involving functional group manipulation is required.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Candidate Options**\n\nThe most effective way to solve this is to identify which sequences contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option B:** `... ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (step iv) on the product of sulfonation (step iii), which is a nitro-sulfonic acid. Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). This sequence is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence forms aniline in step (ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on it. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic attack. This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v) and then attempts to nitrate it in step (vi). Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard or logical synthetic transformation. This sequence is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This is the only option that does not contain a fundamentally impossible step in its core synthetic sequence (steps i-vii). Let's trace the pathway:\n    1.  **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene.** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration → o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.** This step produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The para isomer is major due to sterics. To achieve the final product, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. While this step is not high-yield, it is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction → 2-tert-butylaniline.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    4.  **iv) Nitration → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.** This is the crucial step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group at C1 is a *meta*-director (directing to C3 and C5). The -tBu group at C2 is an *ortho,para*-director (directing to C3 and C5). The directing effects of both groups cooperate, leading to substitution at the C3 and C5 positions. The desired 3-nitro isomer is formed.\n    5.  **v) Diazotization → Diazonium salt.** The primary amine of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.** The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group.\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** The phenol is treated with base (NaOH) and ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final ether product.\n    8.  **viii & ix:** The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are extraneous and misplaced, likely serving as distractors. The synthesis is complete after step vii.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps, making them invalid synthetic routes. Option A describes a sequence of reactions that is chemically plausible and leads to the correct target molecule. Although one step (the initial nitration) is not high-yield, the overall pathway is the only one among the choices that correctly navigates the complex directing effects to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents (a 1,2,3-substitution pattern).\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director (and very bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and difficult to achieve with simple electrophilic aromatic substitution. A more sophisticated strategy, likely involving blocking groups, is required to control the regiochemistry and achieve a high yield.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each sequence to see if it is chemically sound and leads to the target product.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene. Step (ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: ... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence is chemically impossible. Step (iv) uses NaNO2/HCl, a reagent for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. However, the product from the preceding step is a nitro-sulfonic acid derivative, which has no amino group to react with. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This sequence begins with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large steric bulk, the major product is the *para* isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene). The desired *ortho* isomer, which is required to build the 1,2,3-pattern, is a minor product.\n    *   Since the question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis, a route that relies on separating a minor product in an early step is not ideal. While the rest of the sequence is chemically plausible, it fails the high-yield criterion.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This sequence represents the most sophisticated and appropriate strategy for this type of synthesis.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the -SO3H group to the sterically accessible *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a classic \"blocking group\" strategy, which is a hallmark of a high-yield synthesis for complex isomers.\n    *   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. With the *para* position blocked, the -tBu group directs the incoming -NO2 group to the *ortho* position (C2). The -SO3H group (a *meta*-director) also directs to C2. This concerted directionality leads to a high yield of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amine to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** A second nitration. This is an unusual but key step. All three existing groups (-tBu, -N2+, -SO3H) direct the new nitro group to the same position (C6), making this a highly specific reaction.\n    *   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two things: the diazonium salt at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). This yields **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **viii) dilute H2SO4:** This step is likely redundant or ensures the completion of step vii.\n    *   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol (-OH) is converted to the target ethoxy ether (-OEt). The final product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** (after re-numbering according to IUPAC rules where the ether takes priority).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A is the only sequence that employs the necessary blocking group strategy to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern in high yield. While complex, each step is chemically sound and leads logically to the final product. The other options either contain chemically impossible steps or are not high-yield routes.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Devise a Strategy**\n\n*   **Target:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: -OEt (C1), -tBu (C2), and -NO2 (C3).\n*   **Retrosynthesis (working backward):**\n    *   The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. It is most reliably formed in the final step via a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`) from the corresponding phenol. The precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the phenol is often introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (`H3O+/Heat`). The precursor is the diazonium salt of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   The diazonium salt is formed from the primary amine (`NaNO2/HCl`). The precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   This intermediate, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline, is the key to the synthesis. It has a 1,2,3 substitution pattern. How can we make it? Let's work forward from benzene.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options (Working Forward)**\n\nWe are looking for a sequence that can produce the key intermediate, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence starts with `i) tBuCl` then `ii) SO3/H2SO4`. This is a \"blocking group\" strategy. It forms 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Subsequent nitration gives 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. While this is a valid strategy for controlling regiochemistry, it establishes a 1,2,4-substitution pattern on the ring. It is very difficult to rearrange this to the required 1,2,3 pattern with the given reagents. This path is unlikely to lead to the target.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence has chemically impossible steps. For example, step `iv) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) is attempted on an intermediate that does not have a primary amine group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence starts with `i) HNO3/H2SO4` (nitration), then `ii) Fe/HCl` (reduction to aniline), then `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** Let's trace this sequence carefully.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *o*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To achieve the final 1,2,3 pattern, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. While this is not a high-yield step, it is a necessary one for this pathway.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial step. In the strong acid, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position C3 (and C5). This successfully creates the desired 1,2,3 substitution pattern. The product is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The primary amine of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sequence of reactions (i) through (vii) in Option D provides a chemically logical and valid pathway to the target molecule. The final two steps listed in Option D, `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4`, are extraneous and nonsensically placed at the end of the synthesis, but the core sequence of reagents is correct and unique among the choices. The other options contain fatal chemical flaws.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   **-OEt:** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu:** Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director. Very bulky.\n    *   **-NO2:** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The arrangement is 1,2,3. The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the deactivating group (-NO2). This is a difficult substitution pattern to achieve directly and suggests a multi-step synthesis involving the manipulation of functional groups to alter their directing effects.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Routes\n\nWe will analyze each option to see if it provides a chemically logical path to the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    1.  Benzene is nitrated to nitrobenzene.\n    2.  Nitrobenzene is reduced to aniline.\n    3.  The next step is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect due to a fatal flaw in step (iii).\n\n*   **Option C and D:** These options, as written in the prompt, contain typos and jumbled steps (e.g., `HNO3/H2SO4 iv)`). Analyzing them reveals chemically nonsensical sequences, such as attempting to perform a diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) on a molecule without an amine group or trying to nitrate a diazonium salt.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Options C and D are incorrect as they contain chemically impossible steps.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    Let's trace the core synthesis pathway described by steps (i) through (vii). The final two steps (viii, ix) are sulfonation and desulfonation, which are nonsensically placed at the end and can be ignored as distractors.\n\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director. Due to its large steric bulk, the major product is the *para* isomer. However, the *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, is also formed. To achieve the final 1,2,3-pattern, the synthesis must proceed with this *ortho* isomer. While this is not a high-yield step, it is chemically necessary.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial step for setting the 1,2,3-pattern. In the strong acid, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The anilinium ion at C1 is a *meta*-director, directing the incoming nitro group to C3. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *o,p*-director, also directing to C3. The directing effects cooperate, leading to the formation of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The primary amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group to give **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH, and the resulting phenoxide attacks ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions (i) through (vii) in Option B provides a chemically logical and complete pathway to the target molecule. It is the only option that correctly navigates the complex directing effects to achieve the required 1,2,3-substitution pattern. While the initial nitration step (ii) may not be high-yield, the overall sequence is chemically sound, whereas the other options contain fundamental, disqualifying errors.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2).\n*   **Positions:** They are arranged in a 1, 2, 3 pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director (and very bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:** The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the strong deactivating group (-NO2). This is a difficult arrangement to achieve through direct substitution and suggests a more complex strategy is needed, likely involving the conversion of one functional group into another to change its directing effect during the synthesis.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausibility of Each Option**\n\nWe will examine each sequence for chemical validity. A single chemically impossible step invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) correctly form aniline from benzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect due to a fatal flaw in step (iii).\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This option is poorly written (e.g., two step iv's).\n    *   Crucially, step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization reagent, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The preceding steps produce nitro and sulfonic acid derivatives, but no amine. The amine is not formed until step (viii) `Fe/HCl`. Performing diazotization before forming the amine is impossible.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect due to an impossible reaction order.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This option is also poorly written.\n    *   It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt in step (vi). Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates, and reacting them with a nitrating mixture is not a standard or logical synthetic transformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect due to an illogical step (vi).\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    *   Let's trace the core synthesis (steps i-vii):\n        1.  **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene.** (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n        2.  **ii) Nitration → o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.** The para product is major due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group. To get the 1,2,3-pattern, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This makes the synthesis not \"high-yield\" but it is chemically possible.\n        3.  **iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 2-tert-butylaniline.** The nitro group is reduced to an amine.\n        4.  **iv) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.** This is the key step. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the C3 position. This correctly establishes the 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n        5.  **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) → Diazonium salt.** The amine at C1 is converted to -N2+.\n        6.  **vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+/Heat) → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group.\n        7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether.\n    *   The final two steps (viii and ix) are nonsensical at the end of the synthesis and are likely distractors or errors in the option list. However, the core sequence (i-vii) is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or illogical steps. Option A, despite a low-yield step and two extraneous steps at the end, describes the only chemically viable pathway to the target molecule among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo decide the final answer, I will systematically analyze the chemical validity of each proposed reaction sequence. The goal is to find a high-yield synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: -OEt (C1), -tBu (C2), and -NO2 (C3).\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, ortho/para-director (bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. The meta-relationship between the strong activating group (-OEt) and the deactivating group (-NO2) suggests a non-trivial synthesis, likely involving the manipulation of a functional group's directing effect.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options from the Prompt**\n\nI will analyze each option as written in the original prompt, identifying any chemically impossible steps.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...`\n    *   Steps i-v correctly describe a blocking group strategy to form a diazonium salt (4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid). This is a sound, high-yield strategy up to this point.\n    *   **Step vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`:** This step attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable reaction. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and would likely decompose under these harsh conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A contains a chemically flawed step and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step i) forms nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   **Step iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C contains a chemically impossible step and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ...`\n    *   Step i) forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step ii) nitrates it, forming mainly p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step iii) sulfonates this product.\n    *   **Step iv) `NaNO2/HCl`:** This is a diazotization reagent, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) to react. The product from step iii is a sulfonic acid of a nitro compound and has no amine group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D contains a chemically impossible step and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; ...`\n    *   **i)** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii)** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho and para products. To get the final 1,2,3-pattern, we must proceed with the minor **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. While this step is not high-yield, it is chemically possible.\n    *   **iii)** Reduction of the nitro group → **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv)** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a clever step to establish the 1,2,3-pattern, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   **v)** Diazotization of the amine group.\n    *   **vi)** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **vii)** Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically valid from start to finish and leads to the correct target molecule. Its only weakness is the low yield of the initial ortho-nitration, which may conflict with the \"high-yield\" requirement. However, compared to the other options which are chemically impossible, this is the only viable choice.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are invalid because they contain chemically impossible steps. Option B describes a complete and chemically logical pathway to the target molecule. It is the only correct answer among the choices, despite the potential yield issue in one of its steps. The presence of fundamentally flawed alternatives makes the one possible route the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe task is to identify the sequence of reactions that would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, which is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:** The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the deactivating group (-NO2). This arrangement is difficult to achieve through direct electrophilic substitution and suggests a more complex strategy is required, such as changing a group's directing effect during the synthesis or using a blocking group.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Pathways\n\nLet's analyze the two most plausible strategies discussed in the candidate answers.\n\n**Strategy 1: The \"Anilinium Ion\" Route (Corresponds to Option B in the prompt)**\nThis strategy relies on protonating an amino group to change its directing effect from *o,p* to *meta*.\n1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **Nitration:** tert-butylbenzene is nitrated. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The *para* isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. To proceed, the minor *ortho* isomer must be separated. **This step is not high-yield**, which contradicts the question's requirement.\n3.  **Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming 2-tert-butylaniline.\n4.  **Second Nitration:** The 2-tert-butylaniline is nitrated. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. This directs the new nitro group to the C3 position, correctly forming 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n5.  **Diazotization, Hydrolysis, and Etherification:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt, then to a hydroxyl group, and finally to the target ethoxy group.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Strategy 1:** While chemically sound, this pathway is not \"high-yield\" because of the poor regioselectivity in the first nitration step.\n\n**Strategy 2: The \"Blocking Group\" Route (Corresponds to Option A in the prompt)**\nThis strategy uses a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) to temporarily block the *para* position, forcing subsequent reactions to occur at the *ortho* position. This is a classic technique for high-yield synthesis of specific isomers.\n1.  **i) Alkylation (tBuCl/AlCl3):** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4):** The bulky t-butyl group directs the -SO3H group to the sterically accessible *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield. The reactive *para* position is now blocked.\n3.  **iii) First Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** With the *para* position blocked, nitration is directed to the *ortho* position (C2). Both the -tBu group (*o,p*-director) and the -SO3H group (*m*-director) direct the incoming nitro group to this same position. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** with high regioselectivity and yield.\n4.  **iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl):** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) Second Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** This is a non-obvious but logical step. The existing groups (-tBu, -N2+, -SO3H) all direct the second incoming nitro group to the C6 position.\n7.  **vii) & viii) Hydrolysis and Desulfonation (H3O+/Heat, dilute H2SO4):** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two things: the diazonium group at C2 is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed. This yields **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n8.  **ix) Etherification (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is converted to the corresponding ether. The product is **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**. When named according to IUPAC rules (giving the -OEt group priority at C1), this is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Strategy 2:** This pathway is complex but every step is highly regioselective, fulfilling the \"high-yield\" requirement. It is a superior synthetic design compared to Strategy 1.\n\n### Final Decision\nComparing the options provided in the prompt:\n*   **Option A** describes the reagents for the superior \"Blocking Group\" strategy.\n*   **Option B** describes the reagents for the plausible but lower-yield \"Anilinium Ion\" strategy.\n*   **Option C** fails because it attempts Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n*   **Option D** is chemically jumbled and attempts diazotization on a molecule with no amine group.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of reactions in Option A is the only one that leads to the high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This involves a careful analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) directing effects and multi-step synthesis strategies.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Structure:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl (-tBu), a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C3: Nitro (-NO₂), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Features:** The molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern, which is sterically crowded. Synthesizing this pattern, especially with the given groups, requires a sophisticated strategy to overcome standard directing effects. The question's emphasis on \"high-yield\" is a critical clue, suggesting that pathways relying on the separation of minor isomers are incorrect.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of Proposed Synthetic Pathways\n\nA high-yield synthesis for such a complex substitution pattern will almost certainly involve a **blocking group**. The sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is a classic choice because it is a bulky, *meta*-directing group that can be easily removed later in the synthesis (desulfonation).\n\nLet's analyze the provided options based on this principle.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`**\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction. This option is chemically invalid.\n\n*   **Option C: `... iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence is chemically impossible. Step (iv) uses a diazotization reagent (NaNO₂/HCl), which reacts with primary aromatic amines. The substrate produced in step (iii) is a nitro-sulfonic acid derivative and does not contain an amino group. This option is invalid.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`**\n    This sequence begins with the alkylation of benzene, followed by nitration. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but due to its large steric bulk, nitration overwhelmingly yields the *para* product. To obtain the necessary *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups, one would have to isolate the minor *ortho* isomer. A synthesis that relies on a low-yield step is not a \"high-yield synthesis.\" Therefore, this strategy is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`**\n    This sequence represents the most logical and sophisticated strategy for a high-yield synthesis.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄:** Sulfonation blocks the sterically favored *para* position, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    3.  **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** With the *para* position blocked, nitration is directed to the *ortho* position. Both the -tBu group (*o,p*-director) and the -SO₃H group (*m*-director) direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2). This gives a high yield of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** A second nitration occurs. As analyzed by several agents, the directing effects of all three existing groups (-tBu, -N₂⁺, -SO₃H) align to direct the new nitro group to the only available position, C6.\n    7.  **vii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two crucial transformations simultaneously: the diazonium salt at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). This yields **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    8.  **viii) dilute H₂SO₄:** This is a redundant step, likely ensuring the completion of desulfonation.\n    9.  **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol into the final product. When the product, 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene, is named according to IUPAC rules (giving the ether the highest priority C1), the result is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound, highly regioselective, and the only one that represents a true high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring, meaning all three substituents are adjacent. This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   -OEt (ethoxy): A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu (tert-butyl): A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro): A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **The Challenge:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. A major challenge in synthesizing this molecule is controlling the position of the substituents. For example, if we start by making tert-butylbenzene, the tert-butyl group will direct subsequent substituents to the *para* position in high yield due to its steric bulk. To achieve substitution at the *ortho* position in high yield, a special strategy is required.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Options Based on Synthetic Strategy\n\nA \"high-yield\" synthesis of an *ortho*-substituted product from a starting material with an *ortho, para*-directing group often requires the use of a **blocking group**. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is a classic blocking group because its introduction (sulfonation) is reversible. It can be used to block the sterically favored *para* position, forcing subsequent reactions to occur at the *ortho* position, and can then be removed later (desulfonation).\n\nLet's examine which option employs this necessary high-yield strategy.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence begins by making tert-butylbenzene and then immediately sulfonating it. This places a sulfonic acid group at the *para* position, blocking it. The next step, nitration, is then forced to occur at the *ortho* position. This is the correct strategy for a high-yield synthesis of an *ortho*-substituted intermediate.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence begins by making tert-butylbenzene and then nitrating it. As explained above, this reaction will produce the *para*-nitro product as the major product and the desired *ortho*-nitro product as the minor product. A synthesis that relies on separating a minor product from a major one is not considered \"high-yield\".\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing the desired reaction. This sequence is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence attempts to use a diazotization reagent (NaNO2/HCl) on an intermediate that does not contain a primary amine group. This is chemically impossible.\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of the Correct Strategic Path (Option A)\n\nSince Option A is the only one that employs a valid high-yield strategy, let's trace its steps to confirm its plausibility.\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation blocks the *para* position, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration occurs at the position *ortho* to the t-butyl group and *meta* to the sulfonic acid group. Both groups direct to the same position (C2), yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a high-yield step that creates the crucial *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl and nitro groups.\n4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) - ix):** The remaining steps are a series of functional group manipulations to convert the diazonium salt, remove the blocking group, and add the ethoxy group. While the order and specific reagents listed might be confusing or contain typos (a common issue in complex multiple-choice questions), the initial strategic steps (i-v) are the only ones presented that are consistent with a \"high-yield synthesis\" of a sterically hindered product. The overall sequence, despite potential ambiguities in the later steps, correctly uses a blocking group to control regiochemistry, which is the key to solving this problem.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of synthetic strategy, only Option A outlines a path that is consistent with the \"high-yield\" requirement. It correctly employs a blocking group to overcome the normal directing effects of the tert-butyl group and force the creation of the necessary ortho-disubstituted intermediate. The other options are either chemically impossible (B, C) or do not represent a high-yield strategy (D).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** 1,2,3-trisubstituted (all adjacent).\n*   **Relative Positions & Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt (at C1) is a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu (at C2) is a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -NO2 (at C3) is a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The final structure is sterically crowded. The powerful activating -OEt group is *meta* to the deactivating -NO2 group, an arrangement that is difficult to achieve through direct substitution on a ring containing the -OEt group. This suggests a complex synthesis involving blocking groups and/or functional group interconversions.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each sequence for chemical validity and its ability to produce the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    *   Step (iv) uses `NaNO2/HCl`, a reagent for diazotizing a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid derivative of nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which does not contain an amine. This sequence is chemically impossible. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    *   This sequence is chemically plausible but leads to the wrong isomer.\n    *   i) tert-butylbenzene\n    *   ii) 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (major product)\n    *   iii) 4-tert-butylaniline\n    *   iv) Nitration of the anilinium ion gives 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n    *   Subsequent steps would convert this to 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene, which is an isomer of the target. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr`**\n    *   This sequence, while complex, represents a sophisticated and correct strategy for this synthesis.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the -SO3H group to the *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This acts as a blocking group.\n    *   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. With the *para* position blocked, nitration is directed to the *ortho* position (C2) by both the -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director). This gives a high yield of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amine to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a second nitration. The directing effects of all three groups (-tBu, -N2+, -SO3H) align to direct the new nitro group to the only available activated position, C6. This forms **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **vii) & viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat & dilute H2SO4:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two things simultaneously: the diazonium group at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). This yields **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is converted to an ethoxy group, yielding **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Final Naming:** According to IUPAC rules, the ethoxy group gets priority for C1. Numbering towards the next substituent gives the lowest locants: C1(-OEt), C2(-tBu), C3(-NO2). The final product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A is the only sequence that correctly employs a blocking group strategy and subsequent functional group manipulations to achieve the specific and sterically hindered 1,2,3-substitution pattern of the target molecule in high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. Furthermore, the relationship between the substituents is complex (e.g., the strong *o,p*-directing ethoxy group is *meta* to the nitro group). A simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions will not work. A \"high-yield\" synthesis requires a more sophisticated strategy, likely involving blocking groups to control the position of substitution.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Options\n\nLet's analyze each option based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`**\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is known to fail because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing the desired alkylation. Therefore, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: `... iv) NaNO₂/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence is nonsensically ordered. It attempts to perform a diazotization (step iv, using NaNO₂/HCl) long before the necessary primary amine is formed (step viii, using Fe/HCl). Diazotization only works on primary amines. Therefore, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence is a plausible chemical pathway, but it is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n    1.  Step (i) forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  Step (ii) is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky tert-butyl group is an *o,p*-director, but it strongly favors substitution at the sterically unhindered *para* position. The desired *ortho*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which is required to achieve the final 1,2,3-pattern, is only a minor product.\n    3.  Relying on the separation of a minor product in an early step prevents the overall synthesis from being high-yield. Therefore, **Option C is not the best answer.**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`**\n    This sequence employs a sophisticated and powerful \"blocking group\" strategy, which is characteristic of a high-yield synthesis for a complex target like this.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄:** Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the -SO₃H group to the *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the most reactive position.\n    3.  **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration. With the *para* position blocked, nitration is forced to occur at the *ortho* position. Both the -tBu group (*o,p*-director) and the -SO₃H group (*m*-director) direct the incoming -NO₂ group to position 2. This is a highly regioselective, high-yield step, producing **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** A second nitration occurs. The directing groups (-tBu, -N₂⁺, -SO₃H) all cooperate to direct the new -NO₂ group to position 6.\n    7.  **vii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat & viii) dilute H₂SO₄:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two crucial transformations: the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group is removed (desulfonation). This yields **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    8.  **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol into the final product. When the product, 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol ether, is named according to IUPAC rules (giving the ether priority), the result is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound and uses high-yield reactions to control the substitution pattern precisely. It is the only option that represents a true high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python code successfully analyzed the four proposed synthetic routes to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nThe analysis revealed the following:\n*   **Option A** describes a chemically plausible, multi-step synthesis. While it relies on separating an isomer in an early step (which affects overall yield), the sequence of transformations (alkylation, nitration, reduction, a second nitration, diazotization, hydrolysis, and etherification) is logical and correctly utilizes directing group effects to achieve the required 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n*   **Options B, C, and D** were all found to contain fundamental chemical errors. Option B fails at the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. Option C attempts a diazotization reaction on a molecule without an amine. Option D contains a jumbled and nonsensical sequence of reactions.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only viable synthetic route among the choices provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, meaning all three groups are adjacent. This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Relationship:** The strongly activating -OEt group is *meta* to the deactivating -NO2 group. This arrangement is difficult to achieve through direct nitration of a phenol or ethoxybenzene, as they would direct substitution to the *ortho* and *para* positions. This suggests a more complex strategy is required, likely involving the manipulation of a functional group's directing effect.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Validity**\n\nA reliable way to solve such problems is to identify sequences with chemically impossible steps.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   The product after step (iii) is 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. This molecule does not contain a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   Step (iv) uses `NaNO2/HCl`, a reagent for the diazotization of primary aromatic amines.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This step is chemically impossible. Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence correctly uses a blocking group strategy in steps (i-iii) and forms an amine in step (iv) before diazotization in step (v).\n    *   However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt. This is not a standard or logical synthetic transformation under these conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence contains a chemically nonsensical step. Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Step (i) forms nitrobenzene, and step (ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline using `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This step is chemically impossible. Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence where every step represents a valid, well-known chemical transformation in a logical order. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n        2.  **ii) → o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration. This step produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To achieve the final product, the minor *ortho* isomer must be separated and used. This makes the overall synthesis not \"high-yield,\" but the step is chemically possible.\n        3.  **iii) → 2-tert-butylaniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.\n        4.  **iv) → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *o,p*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position C3 (and C5), allowing for the creation of the crucial 1,2,3-pattern.\n        5.  **v) → Diazonium salt:** The primary amine at C1 is converted to a diazonium salt.\n        6.  **vi) → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol.\n        7.  **vii) → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene:** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether via Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is a chemically viable pathway to the target molecule. While it may not be perfectly high-yield due to the separation required in step (ii), it is the only option that does not contain fundamentally impossible chemical steps. The final two steps listed in the option (viii and ix) are superfluous and incorrectly placed, but the core synthesis (i-vii) is sound.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain steps that are chemically impossible under the given conditions. Option C describes a complete and logical synthesis that leads to the correct product. Despite a potential low-yield step, it is the only chemically valid route among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the points raised by the various candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent groups: -OEt (ethoxy), -tBu (tert-butyl), and -NO₂ (nitro).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Such patterns are often sterically hindered and require careful planning.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director (and very bulky).\n    *   -NO₂: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Relationship:** The strongly activating -OEt group is *meta* to the deactivating -NO₂ group. This is a difficult arrangement to achieve via direct electrophilic substitution and suggests a more complex strategy is needed, likely involving the modification of a functional group's directing effect during the synthesis.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Candidate Options\n\nLet's critically evaluate each proposed reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These options contain fundamental chemical errors.\n    *   **Option B** attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`) in step (iv) on an intermediate that does not have a primary amine group. This is impossible.\n    *   **Option C** attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline in step (iii). This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. This is not a viable synthetic step.\n    *   Therefore, options B and C can be eliminated.\n\n*   **Option D:** This option outlines a \"blocking group\" strategy, which is a valid and often high-yield approach for controlling regiochemistry.\n    *   i) `tBuCl/AlCl₃`: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation blocks the *para* position, forming 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   iii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration occurs *ortho* to the t-butyl group, forming 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   This initial strategy is excellent for creating a 1,2,4-substituted pattern in high yield. However, the target molecule has a 1,2,3-pattern. The subsequent steps as written are nonsensical (e.g., nitrating a diazonium salt in step vi), and even if reordered logically, this pathway cannot easily lead to the 1,2,3-product without a rearrangement that is not feasible with the given reagents. This path leads to the wrong isomer.\n\n*   **Option A:** This option presents a different, more direct strategy.\n    *   **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`**: Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`**: Nitration gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To proceed, the minor *ortho* isomer must be separated. This step is not high-yield, which conflicts with the prompt, but it is chemically possible.\n    *   **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`**: This is the key step. The amine is protonated in strong acid to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The -NH₃⁺ group at C1 is a *meta*-director (directing to C3 and C5). The -tBu group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director (directing to C3 and C5). The directing effects of both groups reinforce each other, leading to the formation of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a clever way to install the third substituent in the correct position.\n    *   **v) `NaNO₂/HCl`**: The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) `H₃O+, H₂O/Heat`**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **viii) & ix)**: The final sulfonation/desulfonation steps are extraneous and likely included as distractors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Options B and C are chemically impossible as written.\n*   Option D employs a sound high-yield strategy (blocking group) but leads to the wrong isomer and has nonsensical later steps.\n*   Option A describes a sequence of chemically valid reactions that logically leads to the correct final product. Its only flaw is that step (ii) is not high-yield, which contradicts the prompt's premise.\n\nIn the context of selecting the best possible answer from a flawed set of choices, a chemically viable pathway that produces the correct molecule (Option A) is superior to pathways that are impossible (B, C) or lead to the wrong product (D). The conflict with the \"high-yield\" condition is likely an error in the question's phrasing. The core sequence of reactions in Option A (steps i-vii) is the only one that correctly constructs the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthetic pathways to determine the correct option.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent substituents on a benzene ring (a 1,2,3-pattern). This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n*   **Substituent Properties:**\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The primary challenges are controlling the position of the incoming groups (regiochemistry) to achieve the 1,2,3-pattern and overcoming the steric hindrance. The relationship between the groups (e.g., the activating -OEt is *meta* to the deactivating -NO₂) suggests that a simple, direct substitution strategy will not work and a more complex approach is necessary.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Proposed Option\n\nA rigorous evaluation involves checking each step of the proposed sequences for chemical validity.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This pathway is chemically invalid. Steps (i) and (ii) correctly synthesize aniline. However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents alkylation.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    This option is nonsensical as written. It contains typos (two step iv's) and is chemically impossible. The diazotization reagent `NaNO₂/HCl` is used in step (iv), but the necessary primary amine precursor is not formed until step (viii). Attempting to perform diazotization on a sulfonic acid derivative is not a valid reaction.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    This sequence employs a \"blocking group\" strategy, which is an excellent approach for achieving high yields of specific isomers.\n    1.  Steps (i) and (ii) correctly form 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid, blocking the sterically favored *para* position.\n    2.  Step (iii) correctly nitrates the ring at the *ortho* position with high selectivity.\n    3.  Steps (iv) and (v) correctly form a diazonium salt.\n    4.  However, **step (vi) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄` is a fatal flaw**. It attempts to nitrate the highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation; the diazonium salt would likely decompose under these harsh conditions. Therefore, this pathway, as written, is chemically invalid.\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    This sequence is the only one that is chemically plausible from start to finish, although it has a significant drawback regarding yield.\n    1.  **i) Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces a mixture of isomers. The major product is the *para* isomer due to the bulk of the tert-butyl group, while the desired **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** is a minor product. This step is chemically possible but is **not high-yield**, which contradicts the premise of the question.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) Second Nitration:** This is the key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). This ion is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, successfully creating the desired **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) Diazotization:** The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) Etherification:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  The final two steps (viii and ix) are superfluous and can be ignored as distractors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Options A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps, making them invalid synthetic routes.\n*   Option C describes a sequence of reactions that is entirely chemically valid and leads to the correct target molecule. Its only flaw is that the second step is not high-yield, which makes the overall synthesis inefficient and conflicts with the question's premise.\n\nHowever, when choosing from the given options, a chemically possible but low-yield pathway (Option C) is the only correct answer compared to pathways that are chemically impossible (Options A, B, and D). A reaction that works with low yield is still a valid reaction, whereas a reaction that is impossible invalidates the entire sequence. Therefore, Option C is the only sequence that would successfully lead to the synthesis of the product.\n\n<<<C>>>"

A careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed reaction sequence is necessary, paying close attention to the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution, including directing effects and steric hindrance.\n\n**Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  Ethoxy (-OEt) at C1: A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  tert-Butyl (-tBu) at C2: A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky.\n    3.  Nitro (-NO₂) at C3: A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Structural Features:** The three substituents are on adjacent carbons (a 1,2,3-pattern). This is a sterically crowded arrangement. The strongly activating -OEt group is *meta* to the deactivating -NO₂ group, which is a difficult arrangement to achieve via direct substitution and suggests a more complex synthetic route involving functional group manipulation.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option for chemical validity.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is chemically flawed. Step (iii) produces a sulfonic acid derivative of nitro-tert-butylbenzene. This molecule does not contain a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). Step (iv) uses NaNO₂/HCl, the reagent for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine to react. Therefore, this sequence is impossible as written.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence is also chemically flawed. Steps (i) and (ii) correctly synthesize aniline from benzene. However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is known to fail because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring, preventing the desired alkylation. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence contains a chemically nonsensical step. After forming a diazonium salt in step (v), step (vi) attempts to nitrate it using HNO₃/H₂SO₄. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates; they would not survive these harsh nitrating conditions and this is not a standard synthetic transformation. Therefore, this sequence is invalid.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This sequence presents a chemically logical pathway to the target molecule, although it has a notable limitation.\n    1.  **i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene:** A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  **ii) tert-Butylbenzene → o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming nitro group to the *ortho* and *para* positions. The *para* isomer is the major product due to less steric hindrance. To proceed, the minor *ortho* isomer must be separated. This step prevents the overall synthesis from being truly \"high-yield,\" but it is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → 2-tert-butylaniline:** The nitro group is reduced to a primary amine using Fe/HCl.\n    4.  **iv) 2-tert-butylaniline → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the crucial step to establish the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). This ion is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, making this a feasible transformation.\n    5.  **v) 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline → Diazonium salt:** The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) Diazonium salt → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol by heating in aqueous acid.\n    7.  **vii) 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ethoxy ether product.\n    8.  **viii & ix:** The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are superfluous as they are listed after the target molecule has already been synthesized. They are likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible steps and are therefore incorrect. Option C describes a sequence of reactions that is entirely plausible and leads directly to the desired product. While the yield of the second step is not ideal, it is the only chemically valid pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Such adjacent substitution patterns are often challenging to synthesize.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt (ethoxy): Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu (tert-butyl): Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro): Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Relationship:** The strongly activating -OEt group is *meta* to the deactivating -NO2 group. This arrangement is difficult to achieve by direct nitration of a precursor containing the ethoxy group, suggesting a more complex strategy involving functional group manipulation is required.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence to identify any chemically impossible steps or pathways that lead to the wrong product.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    1.  Steps (i) and (ii) correctly synthesize aniline from benzene.\n    2.  Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline. This deactivates the ring and prevents the desired alkylation.\n    3.  **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect because it contains a chemically non-viable step.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    1.  This sequence attempts to use the diazotization reagent `NaNO2/HCl` in step (iv).\n    2.  Diazotization is a reaction specific to primary aromatic amines (-NH₂). The intermediate formed after steps (i), (ii), and (iii) is a nitrated and sulfonated version of tert-butylbenzene, which does not contain an amino group.\n    3.  **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect because it applies a reagent to an intermediate that cannot react with it.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    1.  Steps (i) through (v) outline a valid strategy: alkylation, blocking the para position with a sulfonyl group, nitration, reduction of the nitro group to an amine, and finally diazotization of that amine.\n    2.  However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate the diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; reacting them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or logical synthetic step. They are typically used immediately for replacement reactions.\n    3.  **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect because it contains a chemically nonsensical step.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    1.  **i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  **ii) tert-butylbenzene → o/p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration. To achieve the final 1,2,3-pattern, the synthesis must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. While this is not a high-yield step, it is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → 2-tert-butylaniline:** Standard reduction of the nitro group.\n    4.  **iv) 2-tert-butylaniline → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the crucial step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). This group is a *meta*-director, directing the incoming nitro group to position 3. This correctly establishes the 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n    5.  **v) 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline → Diazonium salt:** Standard diazotization of the primary amine.\n    6.  **vi) Diazonium salt → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces the -N₂⁺ group with an -OH group.\n    7.  **vii) 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ethoxy ether product.\n    8.  **viii) & ix):** The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are nonsensical as they are placed after the target molecule has already been formed. They are likely included as distractors.\n    9.  **Conclusion:** The core sequence of reactions (i through vii) in Option B is a chemically logical and valid pathway that leads to the desired product. It is the only option that does not contain a fundamentally impossible chemical step.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nWhile Option B is not a perfect \"high-yield\" synthesis due to the initial nitration step and contains two superfluous steps at the end, it is the only sequence among the choices that is chemically viable and leads to the correct target molecule. The other options are invalidated by chemically impossible steps.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Positions:** The substituents are on adjacent carbons in a 1,2,3-pattern.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:**\n    *   The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the deactivating group (-NO2).\n    *   The bulky -tBu group is *ortho* to both the -OEt and -NO2 groups.\n\nThis substitution pattern is sterically crowded and electronically challenging to achieve through simple electrophilic aromatic substitution. A direct nitration of a precursor containing an ethoxy group would not place the nitro group at the meta position. This indicates that a more complex strategy involving functional group manipulation is required.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Candidate Options**\n\nThe most effective way to solve this is to identify which sequences contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option B:** `... ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (step iv) on the product of sulfonation (step iii), which is a nitro-sulfonic acid. Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). This sequence is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence forms aniline in step (ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on it. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic attack. This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v) and then attempts to nitrate it in step (vi). Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard or logical synthetic transformation. This sequence is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This is the only option that does not contain a fundamentally impossible step in its core synthetic sequence (steps i-vii). Let's trace the pathway:\n    1.  **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene.** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration → o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.** This step produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The para isomer is major due to sterics. To achieve the final product, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. While this step is not high-yield, it is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction → 2-tert-butylaniline.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    4.  **iv) Nitration → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.** This is the crucial step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group at C1 is a *meta*-director (directing to C3 and C5). The -tBu group at C2 is an *ortho,para*-director (directing to C3 and C5). The directing effects of both groups cooperate, leading to substitution at the C3 and C5 positions. The desired 3-nitro isomer is formed.\n    5.  **v) Diazotization → Diazonium salt.** The primary amine of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.** The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group.\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** The phenol is treated with base (NaOH) and ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final ether product.\n    8.  **viii & ix:** The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are extraneous and misplaced, likely serving as distractors. The synthesis is complete after step vii.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps, making them invalid synthetic routes. Option A describes a sequence of reactions that is chemically plausible and leads to the correct target molecule. Although one step (the initial nitration) is not high-yield, the overall pathway is the only one among the choices that correctly navigates the complex directing effects to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents (a 1,2,3-substitution pattern).\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director (and very bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and difficult to achieve with simple electrophilic aromatic substitution. A more sophisticated strategy, likely involving blocking groups, is required to control the regiochemistry and achieve a high yield.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each sequence to see if it is chemically sound and leads to the target product.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene. Step (ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: ... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence is chemically impossible. Step (iv) uses NaNO2/HCl, a reagent for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. However, the product from the preceding step is a nitro-sulfonic acid derivative, which has no amino group to react with. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This sequence begins with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large steric bulk, the major product is the *para* isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene). The desired *ortho* isomer, which is required to build the 1,2,3-pattern, is a minor product.\n    *   Since the question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis, a route that relies on separating a minor product in an early step is not ideal. While the rest of the sequence is chemically plausible, it fails the high-yield criterion.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This sequence represents the most sophisticated and appropriate strategy for this type of synthesis.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the -SO3H group to the sterically accessible *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a classic \"blocking group\" strategy, which is a hallmark of a high-yield synthesis for complex isomers.\n    *   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. With the *para* position blocked, the -tBu group directs the incoming -NO2 group to the *ortho* position (C2). The -SO3H group (a *meta*-director) also directs to C2. This concerted directionality leads to a high yield of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amine to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** A second nitration. This is an unusual but key step. All three existing groups (-tBu, -N2+, -SO3H) direct the new nitro group to the same position (C6), making this a highly specific reaction.\n    *   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two things: the diazonium salt at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). This yields **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **viii) dilute H2SO4:** This step is likely redundant or ensures the completion of step vii.\n    *   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol (-OH) is converted to the target ethoxy ether (-OEt). The final product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** (after re-numbering according to IUPAC rules where the ether takes priority).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A is the only sequence that employs the necessary blocking group strategy to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern in high yield. While complex, each step is chemically sound and leads logically to the final product. The other options either contain chemically impossible steps or are not high-yield routes.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Devise a Strategy**\n\n*   **Target:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: -OEt (C1), -tBu (C2), and -NO2 (C3).\n*   **Retrosynthesis (working backward):**\n    *   The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. It is most reliably formed in the final step via a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`) from the corresponding phenol. The precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the phenol is often introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (`H3O+/Heat`). The precursor is the diazonium salt of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   The diazonium salt is formed from the primary amine (`NaNO2/HCl`). The precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   This intermediate, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline, is the key to the synthesis. It has a 1,2,3 substitution pattern. How can we make it? Let's work forward from benzene.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options (Working Forward)**\n\nWe are looking for a sequence that can produce the key intermediate, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence starts with `i) tBuCl` then `ii) SO3/H2SO4`. This is a \"blocking group\" strategy. It forms 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Subsequent nitration gives 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. While this is a valid strategy for controlling regiochemistry, it establishes a 1,2,4-substitution pattern on the ring. It is very difficult to rearrange this to the required 1,2,3 pattern with the given reagents. This path is unlikely to lead to the target.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence has chemically impossible steps. For example, step `iv) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) is attempted on an intermediate that does not have a primary amine group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence starts with `i) HNO3/H2SO4` (nitration), then `ii) Fe/HCl` (reduction to aniline), then `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** Let's trace this sequence carefully.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *o*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To achieve the final 1,2,3 pattern, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. While this is not a high-yield step, it is a necessary one for this pathway.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial step. In the strong acid, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position C3 (and C5). This successfully creates the desired 1,2,3 substitution pattern. The product is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The primary amine of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sequence of reactions (i) through (vii) in Option D provides a chemically logical and valid pathway to the target molecule. The final two steps listed in Option D, `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4`, are extraneous and nonsensically placed at the end of the synthesis, but the core sequence of reagents is correct and unique among the choices. The other options contain fatal chemical flaws.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   **-OEt:** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu:** Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director. Very bulky.\n    *   **-NO2:** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The arrangement is 1,2,3. The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the deactivating group (-NO2). This is a difficult substitution pattern to achieve directly and suggests a multi-step synthesis involving the manipulation of functional groups to alter their directing effects.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Routes\n\nWe will analyze each option to see if it provides a chemically logical path to the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    1.  Benzene is nitrated to nitrobenzene.\n    2.  Nitrobenzene is reduced to aniline.\n    3.  The next step is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect due to a fatal flaw in step (iii).\n\n*   **Option C and D:** These options, as written in the prompt, contain typos and jumbled steps (e.g., `HNO3/H2SO4 iv)`). Analyzing them reveals chemically nonsensical sequences, such as attempting to perform a diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) on a molecule without an amine group or trying to nitrate a diazonium salt.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Options C and D are incorrect as they contain chemically impossible steps.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    Let's trace the core synthesis pathway described by steps (i) through (vii). The final two steps (viii, ix) are sulfonation and desulfonation, which are nonsensically placed at the end and can be ignored as distractors.\n\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director. Due to its large steric bulk, the major product is the *para* isomer. However, the *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, is also formed. To achieve the final 1,2,3-pattern, the synthesis must proceed with this *ortho* isomer. While this is not a high-yield step, it is chemically necessary.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial step for setting the 1,2,3-pattern. In the strong acid, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The anilinium ion at C1 is a *meta*-director, directing the incoming nitro group to C3. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *o,p*-director, also directing to C3. The directing effects cooperate, leading to the formation of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The primary amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group to give **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH, and the resulting phenoxide attacks ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions (i) through (vii) in Option B provides a chemically logical and complete pathway to the target molecule. It is the only option that correctly navigates the complex directing effects to achieve the required 1,2,3-substitution pattern. While the initial nitration step (ii) may not be high-yield, the overall sequence is chemically sound, whereas the other options contain fundamental, disqualifying errors.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2).\n*   **Positions:** They are arranged in a 1, 2, 3 pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director (and very bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:** The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the strong deactivating group (-NO2). This is a difficult arrangement to achieve through direct substitution and suggests a more complex strategy is needed, likely involving the conversion of one functional group into another to change its directing effect during the synthesis.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausibility of Each Option**\n\nWe will examine each sequence for chemical validity. A single chemically impossible step invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) correctly form aniline from benzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect due to a fatal flaw in step (iii).\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This option is poorly written (e.g., two step iv's).\n    *   Crucially, step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization reagent, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The preceding steps produce nitro and sulfonic acid derivatives, but no amine. The amine is not formed until step (viii) `Fe/HCl`. Performing diazotization before forming the amine is impossible.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect due to an impossible reaction order.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This option is also poorly written.\n    *   It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt in step (vi). Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates, and reacting them with a nitrating mixture is not a standard or logical synthetic transformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect due to an illogical step (vi).\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    *   Let's trace the core synthesis (steps i-vii):\n        1.  **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene.** (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n        2.  **ii) Nitration → o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.** The para product is major due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group. To get the 1,2,3-pattern, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This makes the synthesis not \"high-yield\" but it is chemically possible.\n        3.  **iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 2-tert-butylaniline.** The nitro group is reduced to an amine.\n        4.  **iv) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.** This is the key step. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the C3 position. This correctly establishes the 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n        5.  **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) → Diazonium salt.** The amine at C1 is converted to -N2+.\n        6.  **vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+/Heat) → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group.\n        7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether.\n    *   The final two steps (viii and ix) are nonsensical at the end of the synthesis and are likely distractors or errors in the option list. However, the core sequence (i-vii) is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or illogical steps. Option A, despite a low-yield step and two extraneous steps at the end, describes the only chemically viable pathway to the target molecule among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo decide the final answer, I will systematically analyze the chemical validity of each proposed reaction sequence. The goal is to find a high-yield synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: -OEt (C1), -tBu (C2), and -NO2 (C3).\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, ortho/para-director (bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. The meta-relationship between the strong activating group (-OEt) and the deactivating group (-NO2) suggests a non-trivial synthesis, likely involving the manipulation of a functional group's directing effect.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options from the Prompt**\n\nI will analyze each option as written in the original prompt, identifying any chemically impossible steps.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...`\n    *   Steps i-v correctly describe a blocking group strategy to form a diazonium salt (4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid). This is a sound, high-yield strategy up to this point.\n    *   **Step vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`:** This step attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable reaction. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and would likely decompose under these harsh conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A contains a chemically flawed step and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step i) forms nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   **Step iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C contains a chemically impossible step and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ...`\n    *   Step i) forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step ii) nitrates it, forming mainly p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step iii) sulfonates this product.\n    *   **Step iv) `NaNO2/HCl`:** This is a diazotization reagent, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) to react. The product from step iii is a sulfonic acid of a nitro compound and has no amine group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D contains a chemically impossible step and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; ...`\n    *   **i)** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii)** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho and para products. To get the final 1,2,3-pattern, we must proceed with the minor **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. While this step is not high-yield, it is chemically possible.\n    *   **iii)** Reduction of the nitro group → **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv)** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a clever step to establish the 1,2,3-pattern, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   **v)** Diazotization of the amine group.\n    *   **vi)** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **vii)** Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically valid from start to finish and leads to the correct target molecule. Its only weakness is the low yield of the initial ortho-nitration, which may conflict with the \"high-yield\" requirement. However, compared to the other options which are chemically impossible, this is the only viable choice.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are invalid because they contain chemically impossible steps. Option B describes a complete and chemically logical pathway to the target molecule. It is the only correct answer among the choices, despite the potential yield issue in one of its steps. The presence of fundamentally flawed alternatives makes the one possible route the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe task is to identify the sequence of reactions that would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, which is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:** The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the deactivating group (-NO2). This arrangement is difficult to achieve through direct electrophilic substitution and suggests a more complex strategy is required, such as changing a group's directing effect during the synthesis or using a blocking group.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Pathways\n\nLet's analyze the two most plausible strategies discussed in the candidate answers.\n\n**Strategy 1: The \"Anilinium Ion\" Route (Corresponds to Option B in the prompt)**\nThis strategy relies on protonating an amino group to change its directing effect from *o,p* to *meta*.\n1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **Nitration:** tert-butylbenzene is nitrated. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The *para* isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. To proceed, the minor *ortho* isomer must be separated. **This step is not high-yield**, which contradicts the question's requirement.\n3.  **Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming 2-tert-butylaniline.\n4.  **Second Nitration:** The 2-tert-butylaniline is nitrated. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. This directs the new nitro group to the C3 position, correctly forming 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n5.  **Diazotization, Hydrolysis, and Etherification:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt, then to a hydroxyl group, and finally to the target ethoxy group.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Strategy 1:** While chemically sound, this pathway is not \"high-yield\" because of the poor regioselectivity in the first nitration step.\n\n**Strategy 2: The \"Blocking Group\" Route (Corresponds to Option A in the prompt)**\nThis strategy uses a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) to temporarily block the *para* position, forcing subsequent reactions to occur at the *ortho* position. This is a classic technique for high-yield synthesis of specific isomers.\n1.  **i) Alkylation (tBuCl/AlCl3):** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4):** The bulky t-butyl group directs the -SO3H group to the sterically accessible *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield. The reactive *para* position is now blocked.\n3.  **iii) First Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** With the *para* position blocked, nitration is directed to the *ortho* position (C2). Both the -tBu group (*o,p*-director) and the -SO3H group (*m*-director) direct the incoming nitro group to this same position. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** with high regioselectivity and yield.\n4.  **iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl):** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) Second Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** This is a non-obvious but logical step. The existing groups (-tBu, -N2+, -SO3H) all direct the second incoming nitro group to the C6 position.\n7.  **vii) & viii) Hydrolysis and Desulfonation (H3O+/Heat, dilute H2SO4):** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two things: the diazonium group at C2 is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed. This yields **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n8.  **ix) Etherification (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is converted to the corresponding ether. The product is **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**. When named according to IUPAC rules (giving the -OEt group priority at C1), this is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Strategy 2:** This pathway is complex but every step is highly regioselective, fulfilling the \"high-yield\" requirement. It is a superior synthetic design compared to Strategy 1.\n\n### Final Decision\nComparing the options provided in the prompt:\n*   **Option A** describes the reagents for the superior \"Blocking Group\" strategy.\n*   **Option B** describes the reagents for the plausible but lower-yield \"Anilinium Ion\" strategy.\n*   **Option C** fails because it attempts Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n*   **Option D** is chemically jumbled and attempts diazotization on a molecule with no amine group.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of reactions in Option A is the only one that leads to the high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This involves a careful analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) directing effects and multi-step synthesis strategies.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Structure:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl (-tBu), a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C3: Nitro (-NO₂), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Features:** The molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern, which is sterically crowded. Synthesizing this pattern, especially with the given groups, requires a sophisticated strategy to overcome standard directing effects. The question's emphasis on \"high-yield\" is a critical clue, suggesting that pathways relying on the separation of minor isomers are incorrect.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of Proposed Synthetic Pathways\n\nA high-yield synthesis for such a complex substitution pattern will almost certainly involve a **blocking group**. The sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is a classic choice because it is a bulky, *meta*-directing group that can be easily removed later in the synthesis (desulfonation).\n\nLet's analyze the provided options based on this principle.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`**\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction. This option is chemically invalid.\n\n*   **Option C: `... iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence is chemically impossible. Step (iv) uses a diazotization reagent (NaNO₂/HCl), which reacts with primary aromatic amines. The substrate produced in step (iii) is a nitro-sulfonic acid derivative and does not contain an amino group. This option is invalid.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`**\n    This sequence begins with the alkylation of benzene, followed by nitration. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but due to its large steric bulk, nitration overwhelmingly yields the *para* product. To obtain the necessary *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups, one would have to isolate the minor *ortho* isomer. A synthesis that relies on a low-yield step is not a \"high-yield synthesis.\" Therefore, this strategy is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`**\n    This sequence represents the most logical and sophisticated strategy for a high-yield synthesis.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄:** Sulfonation blocks the sterically favored *para* position, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    3.  **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** With the *para* position blocked, nitration is directed to the *ortho* position. Both the -tBu group (*o,p*-director) and the -SO₃H group (*m*-director) direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2). This gives a high yield of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** A second nitration occurs. As analyzed by several agents, the directing effects of all three existing groups (-tBu, -N₂⁺, -SO₃H) align to direct the new nitro group to the only available position, C6.\n    7.  **vii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two crucial transformations simultaneously: the diazonium salt at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). This yields **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    8.  **viii) dilute H₂SO₄:** This is a redundant step, likely ensuring the completion of desulfonation.\n    9.  **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol into the final product. When the product, 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene, is named according to IUPAC rules (giving the ether the highest priority C1), the result is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound, highly regioselective, and the only one that represents a true high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring, meaning all three substituents are adjacent. This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   -OEt (ethoxy): A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu (tert-butyl): A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro): A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **The Challenge:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. A major challenge in synthesizing this molecule is controlling the position of the substituents. For example, if we start by making tert-butylbenzene, the tert-butyl group will direct subsequent substituents to the *para* position in high yield due to its steric bulk. To achieve substitution at the *ortho* position in high yield, a special strategy is required.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Options Based on Synthetic Strategy\n\nA \"high-yield\" synthesis of an *ortho*-substituted product from a starting material with an *ortho, para*-directing group often requires the use of a **blocking group**. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is a classic blocking group because its introduction (sulfonation) is reversible. It can be used to block the sterically favored *para* position, forcing subsequent reactions to occur at the *ortho* position, and can then be removed later (desulfonation).\n\nLet's examine which option employs this necessary high-yield strategy.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence begins by making tert-butylbenzene and then immediately sulfonating it. This places a sulfonic acid group at the *para* position, blocking it. The next step, nitration, is then forced to occur at the *ortho* position. This is the correct strategy for a high-yield synthesis of an *ortho*-substituted intermediate.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence begins by making tert-butylbenzene and then nitrating it. As explained above, this reaction will produce the *para*-nitro product as the major product and the desired *ortho*-nitro product as the minor product. A synthesis that relies on separating a minor product from a major one is not considered \"high-yield\".\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing the desired reaction. This sequence is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence attempts to use a diazotization reagent (NaNO2/HCl) on an intermediate that does not contain a primary amine group. This is chemically impossible.\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of the Correct Strategic Path (Option A)\n\nSince Option A is the only one that employs a valid high-yield strategy, let's trace its steps to confirm its plausibility.\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation blocks the *para* position, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration occurs at the position *ortho* to the t-butyl group and *meta* to the sulfonic acid group. Both groups direct to the same position (C2), yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a high-yield step that creates the crucial *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl and nitro groups.\n4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) - ix):** The remaining steps are a series of functional group manipulations to convert the diazonium salt, remove the blocking group, and add the ethoxy group. While the order and specific reagents listed might be confusing or contain typos (a common issue in complex multiple-choice questions), the initial strategic steps (i-v) are the only ones presented that are consistent with a \"high-yield synthesis\" of a sterically hindered product. The overall sequence, despite potential ambiguities in the later steps, correctly uses a blocking group to control regiochemistry, which is the key to solving this problem.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of synthetic strategy, only Option A outlines a path that is consistent with the \"high-yield\" requirement. It correctly employs a blocking group to overcome the normal directing effects of the tert-butyl group and force the creation of the necessary ortho-disubstituted intermediate. The other options are either chemically impossible (B, C) or do not represent a high-yield strategy (D).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** 1,2,3-trisubstituted (all adjacent).\n*   **Relative Positions & Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt (at C1) is a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu (at C2) is a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -NO2 (at C3) is a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The final structure is sterically crowded. The powerful activating -OEt group is *meta* to the deactivating -NO2 group, an arrangement that is difficult to achieve through direct substitution on a ring containing the -OEt group. This suggests a complex synthesis involving blocking groups and/or functional group interconversions.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each sequence for chemical validity and its ability to produce the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    *   Step (iv) uses `NaNO2/HCl`, a reagent for diazotizing a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid derivative of nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which does not contain an amine. This sequence is chemically impossible. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    *   This sequence is chemically plausible but leads to the wrong isomer.\n    *   i) tert-butylbenzene\n    *   ii) 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (major product)\n    *   iii) 4-tert-butylaniline\n    *   iv) Nitration of the anilinium ion gives 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n    *   Subsequent steps would convert this to 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene, which is an isomer of the target. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr`**\n    *   This sequence, while complex, represents a sophisticated and correct strategy for this synthesis.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the -SO3H group to the *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This acts as a blocking group.\n    *   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. With the *para* position blocked, nitration is directed to the *ortho* position (C2) by both the -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director). This gives a high yield of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amine to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a second nitration. The directing effects of all three groups (-tBu, -N2+, -SO3H) align to direct the new nitro group to the only available activated position, C6. This forms **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **vii) & viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat & dilute H2SO4:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two things simultaneously: the diazonium group at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). This yields **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is converted to an ethoxy group, yielding **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Final Naming:** According to IUPAC rules, the ethoxy group gets priority for C1. Numbering towards the next substituent gives the lowest locants: C1(-OEt), C2(-tBu), C3(-NO2). The final product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A is the only sequence that correctly employs a blocking group strategy and subsequent functional group manipulations to achieve the specific and sterically hindered 1,2,3-substitution pattern of the target molecule in high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. Furthermore, the relationship between the substituents is complex (e.g., the strong *o,p*-directing ethoxy group is *meta* to the nitro group). A simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions will not work. A \"high-yield\" synthesis requires a more sophisticated strategy, likely involving blocking groups to control the position of substitution.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Options\n\nLet's analyze each option based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`**\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is known to fail because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing the desired alkylation. Therefore, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: `... iv) NaNO₂/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence is nonsensically ordered. It attempts to perform a diazotization (step iv, using NaNO₂/HCl) long before the necessary primary amine is formed (step viii, using Fe/HCl). Diazotization only works on primary amines. Therefore, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence is a plausible chemical pathway, but it is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n    1.  Step (i) forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  Step (ii) is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky tert-butyl group is an *o,p*-director, but it strongly favors substitution at the sterically unhindered *para* position. The desired *ortho*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which is required to achieve the final 1,2,3-pattern, is only a minor product.\n    3.  Relying on the separation of a minor product in an early step prevents the overall synthesis from being high-yield. Therefore, **Option C is not the best answer.**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`**\n    This sequence employs a sophisticated and powerful \"blocking group\" strategy, which is characteristic of a high-yield synthesis for a complex target like this.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄:** Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the -SO₃H group to the *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the most reactive position.\n    3.  **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration. With the *para* position blocked, nitration is forced to occur at the *ortho* position. Both the -tBu group (*o,p*-director) and the -SO₃H group (*m*-director) direct the incoming -NO₂ group to position 2. This is a highly regioselective, high-yield step, producing **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, forming **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** A second nitration occurs. The directing groups (-tBu, -N₂⁺, -SO₃H) all cooperate to direct the new -NO₂ group to position 6.\n    7.  **vii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat & viii) dilute H₂SO₄:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two crucial transformations: the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group is removed (desulfonation). This yields **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    8.  **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol into the final product. When the product, 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol ether, is named according to IUPAC rules (giving the ether priority), the result is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound and uses high-yield reactions to control the substitution pattern precisely. It is the only option that represents a true high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python code successfully analyzed the four proposed synthetic routes to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nThe analysis revealed the following:\n*   **Option A** describes a chemically plausible, multi-step synthesis. While it relies on separating an isomer in an early step (which affects overall yield), the sequence of transformations (alkylation, nitration, reduction, a second nitration, diazotization, hydrolysis, and etherification) is logical and correctly utilizes directing group effects to achieve the required 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n*   **Options B, C, and D** were all found to contain fundamental chemical errors. Option B fails at the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. Option C attempts a diazotization reaction on a molecule without an amine. Option D contains a jumbled and nonsensical sequence of reactions.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only viable synthetic route among the choices provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, meaning all three groups are adjacent. This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Relationship:** The strongly activating -OEt group is *meta* to the deactivating -NO2 group. This arrangement is difficult to achieve through direct nitration of a phenol or ethoxybenzene, as they would direct substitution to the *ortho* and *para* positions. This suggests a more complex strategy is required, likely involving the manipulation of a functional group's directing effect.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Validity**\n\nA reliable way to solve such problems is to identify sequences with chemically impossible steps.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   The product after step (iii) is 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. This molecule does not contain a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   Step (iv) uses `NaNO2/HCl`, a reagent for the diazotization of primary aromatic amines.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This step is chemically impossible. Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence correctly uses a blocking group strategy in steps (i-iii) and forms an amine in step (iv) before diazotization in step (v).\n    *   However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt. This is not a standard or logical synthetic transformation under these conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence contains a chemically nonsensical step. Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Step (i) forms nitrobenzene, and step (ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline using `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This step is chemically impossible. Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence where every step represents a valid, well-known chemical transformation in a logical order. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n        2.  **ii) → o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration. This step produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To achieve the final product, the minor *ortho* isomer must be separated and used. This makes the overall synthesis not \"high-yield,\" but the step is chemically possible.\n        3.  **iii) → 2-tert-butylaniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.\n        4.  **iv) → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *o,p*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position C3 (and C5), allowing for the creation of the crucial 1,2,3-pattern.\n        5.  **v) → Diazonium salt:** The primary amine at C1 is converted to a diazonium salt.\n        6.  **vi) → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol.\n        7.  **vii) → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene:** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether via Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is a chemically viable pathway to the target molecule. While it may not be perfectly high-yield due to the separation required in step (ii), it is the only option that does not contain fundamentally impossible chemical steps. The final two steps listed in the option (viii and ix) are superfluous and incorrectly placed, but the core synthesis (i-vii) is sound.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain steps that are chemically impossible under the given conditions. Option C describes a complete and logical synthesis that leads to the correct product. Despite a potential low-yield step, it is the only chemically valid route among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the points raised by the various candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent groups: -OEt (ethoxy), -tBu (tert-butyl), and -NO₂ (nitro).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Such patterns are often sterically hindered and require careful planning.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director (and very bulky).\n    *   -NO₂: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Relationship:** The strongly activating -OEt group is *meta* to the deactivating -NO₂ group. This is a difficult arrangement to achieve via direct electrophilic substitution and suggests a more complex strategy is needed, likely involving the modification of a functional group's directing effect during the synthesis.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Candidate Options\n\nLet's critically evaluate each proposed reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These options contain fundamental chemical errors.\n    *   **Option B** attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`) in step (iv) on an intermediate that does not have a primary amine group. This is impossible.\n    *   **Option C** attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline in step (iii). This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. This is not a viable synthetic step.\n    *   Therefore, options B and C can be eliminated.\n\n*   **Option D:** This option outlines a \"blocking group\" strategy, which is a valid and often high-yield approach for controlling regiochemistry.\n    *   i) `tBuCl/AlCl₃`: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation blocks the *para* position, forming 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   iii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration occurs *ortho* to the t-butyl group, forming 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   This initial strategy is excellent for creating a 1,2,4-substituted pattern in high yield. However, the target molecule has a 1,2,3-pattern. The subsequent steps as written are nonsensical (e.g., nitrating a diazonium salt in step vi), and even if reordered logically, this pathway cannot easily lead to the 1,2,3-product without a rearrangement that is not feasible with the given reagents. This path leads to the wrong isomer.\n\n*   **Option A:** This option presents a different, more direct strategy.\n    *   **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`**: Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`**: Nitration gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To proceed, the minor *ortho* isomer must be separated. This step is not high-yield, which conflicts with the prompt, but it is chemically possible.\n    *   **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`**: This is the key step. The amine is protonated in strong acid to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The -NH₃⁺ group at C1 is a *meta*-director (directing to C3 and C5). The -tBu group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director (directing to C3 and C5). The directing effects of both groups reinforce each other, leading to the formation of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a clever way to install the third substituent in the correct position.\n    *   **v) `NaNO₂/HCl`**: The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) `H₃O+, H₂O/Heat`**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **viii) & ix)**: The final sulfonation/desulfonation steps are extraneous and likely included as distractors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Options B and C are chemically impossible as written.\n*   Option D employs a sound high-yield strategy (blocking group) but leads to the wrong isomer and has nonsensical later steps.\n*   Option A describes a sequence of chemically valid reactions that logically leads to the correct final product. Its only flaw is that step (ii) is not high-yield, which contradicts the prompt's premise.\n\nIn the context of selecting the best possible answer from a flawed set of choices, a chemically viable pathway that produces the correct molecule (Option A) is superior to pathways that are impossible (B, C) or lead to the wrong product (D). The conflict with the \"high-yield\" condition is likely an error in the question's phrasing. The core sequence of reactions in Option A (steps i-vii) is the only one that correctly constructs the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
