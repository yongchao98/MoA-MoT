def check_correctness_of_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the particle decay question.

    The core physics principle is that for a decay to be kinematically allowed,
    the mass of the decaying particle must be greater than or equal to the sum
    of the masses of the decay products.
    
    For the decay X -> f + f_bar:
    m_X >= m_f + m_f_bar
    Since m_f = m_f_bar, the condition simplifies to:
    m_X >= 2 * m_f
    
    Given m_X = 6 GeV, the condition on the fermion mass is:
    m_f <= 3 GeV
