    """
    Checks the correctness of the given LLM answer about the impulse approximation.

    The impulse approximation in nuclear physics simplifies many-body interactions
    by treating a nucleon as if it were free during a high-energy collision.
    This relies on three main assumptions:
    1. The interaction is with a single nucleon (one-body current).
    2. The interaction is so fast that binding forces are negligible during the event.
    4. The rest of the nucleus is "transparent," meaning there are no initial or
       final state interactions (ISI/FSI).

    Assumption 3, regarding the internal quark structure of the nucleon, is a
    separate level of physics (QCD) and not a defining feature of the impulse
    approximation itself.
