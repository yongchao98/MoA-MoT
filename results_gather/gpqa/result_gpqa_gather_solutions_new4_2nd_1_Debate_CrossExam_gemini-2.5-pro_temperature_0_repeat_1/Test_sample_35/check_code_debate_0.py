def check_correctness_of_answer():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer based on the physics principles
    outlined in the question.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Use the given distance (2.1 Gpc) and the Hubble-Lemaître Law to calculate the cosmological redshift (z).
    2.  Use the redshift and the observed energy (3.9 µeV) to calculate the rest-frame energy of the absorption line.
    3.  Compare the calculated rest-frame energy to known spectral lines to identify the transition. It should match the 21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen.
    4.  Based on the identification (atomic hydrogen) and the observation type (absorption line), determine the correct component of the interstellar medium. 21-cm absorption specifically traces the cold atomic medium.
    5.  Compare this derived conclusion with the provided answer (B).
