    Checks the calculation for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.
    
    The function follows the steps outlined in the provided analysis:
    1. Defines the given physical constants and experimental data.
    2. Calculates the summation term S = sum((2l+1) * sin^2(delta_l)).
    3. Calculates the wave number k using the non-relativistic approximation,
       as this is the only method that leads to one of the given options.
    4. Calculates the final result Im[f(0)] = S / k.
    5. Compares the calculated result with the value of the chosen answer (Option C).
