    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the physics problem.

    The problem involves a proton-antiproton annihilation:
    p + p_bar -> 2A+ + 2A-

    Given:
    - Antiproton is "slowly moving" (implies initial kinetic energy is negligible).
    - Rest mass energy of particle A, m_A * c^2 = 300 MeV.

    The solution relies on the conservation of energy.
