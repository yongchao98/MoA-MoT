def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the maximum speed
    of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. The final answer is given as Option A.

    The function performs four key checks:
    1.  **Derivation Check**: It follows the physical derivation from first principles (conservation of total relativistic energy) and compares the result to the formula in Option A.
    2.  **Dimensionality Check**: It verifies that the formula is dimensionally consistent.
    3.  **Physical Plausibility Check**: It ensures the formula always yields a speed less than the speed of light, c.
    4.  **Classical Limit Check**: It verifies that the relativistic formula correctly reduces to the well-known classical formula when c approaches infinity.

    The checks are performed both symbolically (in comments) and numerically.

    # The options as provided in the question
    # A) v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + k*A**2 / (2*m*c**2))**2)
    # B) v_max = sqrt(k*A**2 / m)
    # C) v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1 / (1 - k*A**2 / (2*m))**2)
    # D) v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1 / (1 - k*A**2 / (2*m*c**2)))

    # --- Symbolic/Logical Checks ---

    # 1. Derivation Check
    # The derivation from conservation of total relativistic energy is:
    # E_total = gamma * m * c^2 + 0.5 * k * x^2
    # At x=A, v=0: E_total = m*c^2 + 0.5*k*A^2
    # At x=0, v=v_max: E_total = gamma_max * m * c^2
    # Equating them gives: gamma_max = 1 + (k*A^2)/(2*m*c^2)
    # Solving v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_max^2) yields the formula in Option A.
    # This confirms the derivation matches Option A.

    # 2. Dimensionality Check
    # In Option C, the term k*A^2/(2*m) has units of velocity^2 and is subtracted
    # from the dimensionless number 1, making it dimensionally inconsistent.
    # Option A is dimensionally consistent, as k*A^2/(2*m*c^2) is dimensionless.

    # 3. Physical Plausibility Check
    # Let X = k*A^2/(2*m*c^2), which is > 0.
    # Option A: v_max = c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1+X)^2). Since X>0, (1+X)^2 > 1, so 0 < 1/(1+X)^2 < 1.
    # This ensures the term in the sqrt is between 0 and 1, so 0 <= v_max < c. Plausible.
    # Option D: v_max = c*sqrt(1 + 1/(1-X)). If X<1, the term in the sqrt is > 1, so v_max > c. Impossible.
    # Option C is also impossible as it gives v_max > c.

    # 4. Classical Limit Check
    # The classical formula is Option B: v_classical = sqrt(k*A^2/m).
    # For Option A, as c -> infinity, X -> 0. Using binomial expansion (1+X)^-2 ≈ 1-2X,
    # v_max^2 ≈ c^2 * (1 - (1-2X)) = 2*c^2*X = 2*c^2 * (k*A^2/(2*m*c^2)) = k*A^2/m.
    # So v_max approaches the classical limit.

    # All logical checks point to Option A being the correct one.
    # Now, we perform a numerical verification.
