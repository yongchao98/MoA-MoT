    Checks the correctness of the answer by symbolically deriving the relationship.

    The problem involves transforming a number density distribution from parallax space
    to distance space.

    1. Given: Number density in parallax space, n(plx) = dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5.
    2. Relationship: Distance r and parallax plx are related by plx = 1/r.
    3. Goal: Find the number density in distance space, n(r) = dN/dr.
    4. Method: Use the chain rule for transforming densities: n(r) = n(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|.
