Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct products for the given reactions.

### **Analysis of Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol → A**

1.  **Identify the Mechanism**: The starting material, 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol, is a 1,5-dien-3-ol. The reaction conditions involve a strong base (KH, potassium hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H⁺). This is the classic setup for an **anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement**.
2.  **Step-by-Step Process**:
    *   **Deprotonation**: The strong base KH deprotonates the alcohol to form a potassium alkoxide. The presence of the negative charge on the oxygen dramatically accelerates the subsequent-sigmatropic rearrangement, by a factor of 10¹⁰ to 10¹⁷.
    *   **-Sigmatropic Rearrangement**: The alkoxide undergoes a concerted rearrangement. This process is thermodynamically driven by the formation of a stable enolate and the relief of ring strain from the four-membered cyclobutane ring, which is broken during the reaction.
    *   **Tautomerization**: The rearrangement initially produces a bicyclic enolate intermediate. The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates this enolate, which then rapidly tautomerizes to the more stable ketone product.
3.  **Determine Product A**:
    *   The rearrangement of the spiro[3.5]nonane skeleton forms a bridged **bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane** system.
    *   A crucial check is the conservation of the molecular formula, as a rearrangement is an isomerization. The starting material, C₁₁H₁₆O, must have the same formula as the product.
    *   The molecular formula for `(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one` is C₁₁H₁₆O, making it a valid isomer.
    *   The alternative, `decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one`, would have a molecular formula of C₁₁H₁₈O. Since this is not an isomer, it cannot be the correct product.
    *   Therefore, **Product A is (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**. This eliminates options B and D.

### **Analysis of Reaction 2: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol → B**

1.  **Identify the Mechanism**: This reaction involves an allylic alcohol, an acylating agent (acetyl bromide), and a strong, bulky base (LDA, lithium diisopropylamide). This combination of reagents is characteristic of the **Ireland-Claisen rearrangement**.
2.  **Step-by-Step Process**:
    *   **Ester Formation**: The allylic alcohol is first converted *in situ* to its corresponding ester, (E)-pent-2-en-1-yl acetate.
    *   **Enolate Formation**: A second equivalent of the strong base LDA deprotonates the α-carbon of the ester's acetyl group to form a lithium enolate.
    *   **-Sigmatropic Rearrangement**: This lithium enolate undergoes a concerted-sigmatropic rearrangement to form a new C-C bond.
3.  **Determine Product B**:
    *   The direct product of the rearrangement is a lithium carboxylate.
    *   A critical point is to consider the final state of the product under the given reaction conditions. The reaction is performed with a strong lithium-containing base (LDA), and **no acidic workup step (like H⁺ or H₃O⁺) is specified** for this second reaction.
    *   Therefore, the carboxylic acid product remains in its deprotonated salt form.
    *   The correct product is the lithium salt of 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid.
    *   Therefore, **Product B is lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**. This eliminates option A.

### **Conclusion**

*   Product **A** is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.
*   Product **B** is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.

The only option that correctly identifies both products is C.
