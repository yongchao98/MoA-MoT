    "To determine the numerical value of \"a,\" we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding a particle anywhere in the space it can exist must be equal to 1. This is mathematically expressed as the integral of the squared modulus of the wave function over all possible positions being equal to one.\n\nThe given wave function is `Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i`.\nThe particle is only found in the region between x=1 and x=3.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the probability density function, which is the squared modulus of the wave function, `|Ψ(x)|²`. For a complex function `Ψ = u + iv`, the squared modulus is `u² + v²`.\n\nIn this case:\n*   The real part is `u = a / sqrt(1 + x)`\n*   The imaginary part is `v = -0.5`\n\nSo, the probability density is:\n`|Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²`\n`|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`\n\nNext, we apply the normalization condition by integrating the probability density from x=1 to x=3 and setting the result to 1:\n`∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1`\n\nWe can solve this by integrating the two terms separately:\n1.  `∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx`\n2.  `∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx`\n\nFor the first integral, we factor out the constant `a²`:\n`a² * ∫[from 1 to 3] (1 / (1 + x)) dx`\nThe integral of `1/(1+x)` is `ln(1+x)`. So we have:\n`a² * [ln(1+x)]` evaluated from 1 to 3\n`a² * (ln(1+3) - ln(1+1))`\n`a² * (ln(4) - ln(2))`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, this simplifies to:\n`a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)`\n\nFor the second integral:\n`∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx`\n`[0.25x]` evaluated from 1 to 3\n`0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5`\n\nNow, we combine the results and set them equal to 1:\n`a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`\n\nFinally, we solve for \"a\":\n`a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5`\n`a² * ln(2) = 0.5`\n`a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n\nUsing the value `ln(2) ≈ 0.693`:\n`a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693`\n`a² ≈ 0.7215`\n`a ≈ sqrt(0.7215)`\n`a ≈ 0.849`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
