    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the flux ratio.\n\n### 1. Identify Neutrino Sources by Energy\n\nFirst, we need to know which nuclear reactions in the Sun produce neutrinos in the two energy bands of interest:\n*   **Band 1: 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV)**\n*   **Band 2: 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV)**\n\nThe primary neutrino-producing reactions and their energy ranges are:\n*   **pp-I chain:**\n    *   `p + p → d + e⁺ + νe` (`pp` neutrinos): Continuous spectrum up to 0.42 MeV. **Does not contribute to either band.**\n*   **pp-II chain:**\n    *   `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe` (`⁷Be` neutrinos): Produces a sharp energy line, primarily at 0.861 MeV (861 keV). This falls squarely in **Band 2**.\n*   **pp-III chain:**\n    *   `⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νe` (`⁸B` neutrinos): Produces a continuous spectrum of high-energy neutrinos up to about 15 MeV. This spectrum starts from zero, so it contributes to **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n*   **CNO cycle:**\n    *   `¹³N → ¹³C + e⁺ + νe`: Continuous spectrum up to 1.20 MeV. Contributes to **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n    *   `¹⁵O → ¹⁵N + e⁺ + νe`: Continuous spectrum up to 1.73 MeV. Contributes to **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n\n### 2. Apply the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stopped**. The defining reaction of the pp-III branch is the one that produces Boron-8 (`⁸B`), which then decays to produce high-energy neutrinos. Therefore, in this scenario, the flux of `⁸B` neutrinos drops to zero. All other reactions, including the pp-II chain and the CNO cycle, continue as normal.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Remaining Fluxes\n\nLet's see what neutrino sources are left for each band after the pp-III branch stops:\n\n*   **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV):**\n    *   `⁸B` neutrinos: Flux is now zero.\n    *   Remaining sources: `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` neutrinos from the CNO cycle.\n\n*   **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV):**\n    *   `⁸B` neutrinos: Flux is now zero.\n    *   Remaining sources: The prominent `⁷Be` line at 861 keV and the continuous spectra from `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` neutrinos.\n\n### 4. Compare the Flux Magnitudes\n\nNow we need to compare the total remaining flux in Band 1 to the total remaining flux in Band 2.\n\n*   The flux from CNO-cycle neutrinos (`¹³N`, `¹⁵O`) is known to be significantly lower than the flux from the main pp-chain reactions. In a standard solar model, the CNO cycle contributes only about 1% of the Sun's energy.\n*   The `⁷Be` neutrino flux, which comes from the pp-II chain, is very large. It is the second-largest component of the solar neutrino flux, after the `pp` neutrinos.\n*   Looking at the solar neutrino spectrum, the peak of the `⁷Be` line flux at 861 keV is vastly higher than the continuous flux from the CNO cycle neutrinos in the 700-900 keV range. The CNO flux is more than an order of magnitude smaller.\n\nTherefore:\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV)** is determined by the small contribution of CNO neutrinos.\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV)** is dominated by the very large `⁷Be` neutrino line flux, with a much smaller addition from CNO neutrinos.\n\nThe flux in Band 2 will be substantially larger than the flux in Band 1. The ratio Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2) will be a small number.\n\nGiven the options:\n*   A) 1.0 (fluxes are equal) - Incorrect.\n*   B) 10.0 (Band 1 is much larger) - Incorrect.\n*   C) 0.1 (Band 2 is 10 times larger) - This is a plausible order of magnitude.\n*   D) 0.01 (Band 2 is 100 times larger) - This is also a plausible order of magnitude.\n\nTo refine the choice between C and D, we can look at the relative flux values from solar models. The total flux of `⁷Be` neutrinos is roughly 5 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹, while the total fluxes for `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` are in the range of 2-5 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹. Since the `⁷Be` flux is concentrated in a single line within Band 2, and the CNO flux is spread out over a wider energy range, the flux density at any point in the CNO spectrum will be significantly lower. The `⁷Be` line flux is roughly 10 times greater than the total CNO flux. This makes the ratio of the flux densities even more extreme. A ratio of 0.01 is a more accurate estimate of the relative magnitudes than 0.1.\n\nLet's summarize the final comparison:\n*   **Flux(Band 1):** A small value from the tail of the CNO spectra.\n*   **Flux(Band 2):** A very large value from the `⁷Be` line, plus a small value from CNO.\n*   **Ratio:** (small CNO flux) / (large `⁷Be` flux + small CNO flux) ≈ small/large << 1. The difference in magnitude between the `⁷Be` line flux and the CNO continuous flux in this region is approximately two orders of magnitude.\n\nThus, the approximate ratio is 0.01.\n\n<<<D>>>"
