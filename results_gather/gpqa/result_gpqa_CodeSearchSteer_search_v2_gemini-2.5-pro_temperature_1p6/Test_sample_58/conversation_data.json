    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of acid and base being mixed.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n    *   **CH3COOH (weak acid):** Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n    *   **HCl (strong acid):** Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol. Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):** Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol. Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), the total moles of OH⁻ ions are 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n2.  **Neutralize the strong acid and strong base:**\n    The strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂) will react first in a neutralization reaction:\n    H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    The H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant. They will neutralize 0.080 moles of OH⁻ ions.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n3.  **React the remaining strong base with the weak acid:**\n    Now, the excess OH⁻ ions will react with the weak acid, CH₃COOH:\n    CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of remaining OH⁻ = 0.100 mol\n    The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely neutralized by the OH⁻ ions.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ consumed = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of excess OH⁻ after this reaction = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH of the final solution:**\n    The final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻ ions, which is a strong base. The presence of this strong base will dominate the pH of the solution. The contribution from the weakly basic acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) formed is negligible in comparison.\n    *   **Total Volume:** 0.500 L + 0.400 L + 0.300 L = 1.2 L\n    *   **Concentration of OH⁻:** [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n    *   **Calculate pOH:** pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   **Calculate pH:** pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
