    "An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with the symmetry axis along the z-axis can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole, especially when its size is much smaller than the radiated wavelength. The behavior of such a system is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism.\n\n**Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is proportional to sin²(θ), where θ is the angle with respect to the z-axis. This relationship shows that the radiated power is zero along the axis of oscillation (θ = 0°) and maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis of oscillation (θ = 90°).\n\nThe maximum radiated power, denoted as A, occurs at θ = 90°, where sin²(90°) = 1.\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle θ = 30°, we calculate the ratio:\n\n(Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°)\n\nSince sin(30°) = 1/2, sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4.\nTherefore, the fraction is (1/4) / 1 = 1/4.\n\n**Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴). The angular frequency (ω) is related to the wavelength (λ) by the formula ω = 2πc/λ, where c is the speed of light.\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for power:\n\nPower ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n\nThis inverse fourth-power relationship is characteristic of electric dipole radiation, often referred to as Rayleigh scattering. Thus, the function *f* describing the radiated power per unit solid angle will have a λ⁻⁴ dependence.\n\nCombining these two findings, the fraction of the maximum power *A* radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4, and a possible form of the function *f* is proportional to λ⁻⁴.\n\n<<<C>>>"
