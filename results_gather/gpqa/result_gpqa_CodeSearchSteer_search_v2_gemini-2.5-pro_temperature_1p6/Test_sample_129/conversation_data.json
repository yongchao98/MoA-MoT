    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected by ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength at which Earth's atmosphere becomes transparent to light.\n\n### Key Factors:\n*   **Lyman-alpha Wavelength:** Neutral hydrogen absorbs light at the Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) wavelength, which is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers (nm) in its rest frame. This wavelength is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n*   **Atmospheric Cutoff:** Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone, blocks most ultraviolet radiation. Ground-based optical telescopes can typically observe light at wavelengths longer than about 3000 to 3300 Å (300 to 330 nm). The Giant Magellan Telescope, for example, is designed for observations in the optical range of 3000 to 10,000 Å.\n*   **Redshift:** The expansion of the universe stretches the wavelength of light as it travels. This phenomenon, known as redshift (z), causes the absorption feature from the distant hydrogen cloud to appear at a longer, \"redshifted\" wavelength when it reaches Earth.\n\n### Calculation:\nThe relationship between the rest wavelength (λ_rest), the observed wavelength (λ_observed), and redshift (z) is given by the formula:\n\n**1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest**\n\nTo find the minimum redshift for detection, we use:\n*   **λ_rest**: The Lyman-alpha wavelength, 1216 Å.\n*   **λ_observed**: The minimum wavelength that can penetrate the atmosphere and be detected by a ground-based telescope. We will use a conservative value of ~3500 Å for the atmospheric cutoff, which is where atmospheric transmission starts to become significant for ground-based observatories.\n\n**1. Set the observed wavelength to the atmospheric cutoff:**\n   λ_observed ≈ 3500 Å\n\n**2. Calculate the redshift (z):**\n   z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n   z = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\n   z ≈ 2.88 - 1\n   z ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculation shows that the light needs to be redshifted by a factor of about 1.88 to be observable from the ground. Reviewing the options provided:\n\nA) 3\nB) 1.2\nC) 2.4\nD) 1.9\n\nThe calculated value of ~1.88 is closest to 1.9. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for these objects to be detectable with optical ground-based telescopes is approximately 1.9.\n\n<<<D>>>"
