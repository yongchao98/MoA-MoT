    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the major isomer of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene with Maleic Anhydride**\n\nCyclooctatetraene (COT) itself is non-planar and exists in a tub-shaped conformation. To participate in a Diels-Alder reaction, it must first undergo a thermal electrocyclic ring-closure to form its valence isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This isomer contains a planar *s-cis* diene within its cyclohexadiene ring, which can then react with a dienophile. Maleic anhydride is an excellent dienophile. The Diels-Alder reaction between bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene and maleic anhydride yields a tetracyclic anhydride, known as the \"Reppe-Anhydride\". The stereochemistry of this addition is crucial. Due to steric hindrance from the cyclobutene ring, the maleic anhydride adds to the *exo* face of the diene. This results in the formation of the *exo* adduct as **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1, the *exo*-anhydride, is heated with methanol (CH₃OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) as a catalyst. This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The acid protonates a carbonyl oxygen, activating it for nucleophilic attack by methanol, which opens the anhydride ring. This process results in the formation of two methyl ester groups (-COOCH₃). This reaction is stereospecific, meaning it does not alter the stereochemical arrangement of the carbon backbone. Therefore, **Product 2** is the corresponding dimethyl ester, with the two ester groups retaining the *exo* and *cis* relationship established in the first step.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Final Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is then heated with cyclopentadiene. This is a second Diels-Alder reaction. In this step:\n*   The **diene** is cyclopentadiene.\n*   The **dienophile** is the strained double bond within the cyclobutene ring of Product 2. Cyclobutene derivatives are known to be highly reactive dienophiles.\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of this final step is determined by the direction of approach of the cyclopentadiene to the cyclobutene double bond. The rest of the molecule, particularly the main bicyclic framework, presents a large, sterically hindering face. To minimize steric repulsion, the cyclopentadiene will add to the face of the cyclobutene that is *anti* (opposite) to the main cage of the molecule. Additionally, the Diels-Alder reaction itself proceeds via an *endo* transition state with respect to the diene (cyclopentadiene) and dienophile, which is the kinetically favored pathway.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of these stereochemical controls (*exo* addition in Step 1, stereospecific esterification in Step 2, and a sterically directed *anti* and *endo* addition in Step 3) leads to the formation of a specific stereoisomer as the major product. Analyzing the stereochemical descriptors in the provided options reveals that only one structure matches this outcome.\n\nThe correct structure is **dimethyl (1R,4S,4aS,4bR,5R,8S,8aS,8bR,10R,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
