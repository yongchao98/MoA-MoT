    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** One of the substituents is a halogen atom (e.g., -Cl, -Br) attached directly to the aromatic ring. Halogens do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and a carbonyl group. The only common group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n    Combining these points, the compound must be a **haloacetophenone**. The structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Isomeric Possibilities and their Expected 1H NMR Spectra:**\n    There are three possible positional isomers for a di-substituted benzene ring: *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), and *para* (1,4).\n\n    *   ***ortho*-haloacetophenone:** All four protons on the aromatic ring would be chemically distinct and would likely appear as complex multiplets.\n    *   ***meta*-haloacetophenone:** All four protons on the aromatic ring would also be chemically distinct, leading to four separate and complex signals.\n    *   ***para*-haloacetophenone:** Due to a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents, there are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons next to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons next to the halogen are equivalent. This substitution pattern typically gives a clean spectrum with two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons. The methyl protons of the acetyl group (-COCH3) would appear as a sharp singlet (as there are no adjacent protons to couple with) typically in the 2.1-2.6 ppm region.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This option also shows prominent peaks outside the expected aromatic region and shows only one aromatic proton, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde, like halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO), the CH2 protons at 3.7 ppm should be a doublet (split by the CHO proton), and the CHO proton at 9.9 ppm should be a triplet (split by the CH2 protons). The data shows both as singlets, which is inconsistent.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`), which is the classic pattern for a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   It also shows a singlet integrating to three protons at 2.3 ppm (`2.3 (3H, s)`), which is the characteristic chemical shift and multiplicity for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n        *   This data perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a *para*-haloacetophenone, and the correct 1H NMR data is provided in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
