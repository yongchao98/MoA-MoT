    "To calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the given Schrödinger cat state, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Measure of Non-Gaussianity:** The problem provides the relative entropy measure `del_b = trace(ρ ln ρ) - trace(τ ln τ)`. This is equivalent to `S(τ) - S(ρ)`, where `S(σ) = -trace(σ ln σ)` is the von Neumann entropy. This is a standard measure for non-Gaussianity. Here, `ρ` is the density matrix of the state being analyzed, and `τ` is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as `ρ`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the State `ρ`:** The state is given by `|ψ> = (cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α>) / N`. This is a pure quantum state. For any pure state, the density matrix `ρ = |ψ><ψ|` has one eigenvalue equal to 1 and all others equal to 0. Consequently, the von Neumann entropy `S(ρ) = - (1 * ln(1) + 0 * ln(0) + ...)` is zero. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity simplifies to `nG = S(τ)`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Reference Gaussian State `τ`:** We need to find the Gaussian state `τ` that has the same first two moments as `ρ`. For the given parameters `φ = -π/4` and `α = 0.5`, the state is an \"odd cat state\": `|ψ> ∝ (|α> - |-α>)`. A Gaussian state is completely defined by its first moment (displacement vector) and second moment (covariance matrix).\n    *   **First Moment (Displacement):** The displacement is given by `< a > = <ψ|a|ψ>`. For the odd cat state, this evaluates to zero.\n    *   **Second Moments (Covariance Matrix):** For a state with zero displacement, the covariance matrix is determined by the mean photon number `<n> = <ψ|a†a|ψ>` and the squeezing term `<a²> = <ψ|a²|ψ>`.\n        *   The mean photon number for this state is calculated as `<n> = α² coth(α²)`.\n        *   The squeezing term is calculated as `<a²> = α²`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `S(τ)`:** Since the squeezing term `<a²>` is not zero, the reference state `τ` is a squeezed thermal state (the most general single-mode Gaussian state with zero displacement). Its entropy is given by the formula:\n    `S(τ) = (ν + 1/2)ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2)ln(ν - 1/2)`\n    where `ν` is the symplectic eigenvalue of the state's covariance matrix. This eigenvalue can be calculated from the mean photon number `<n>` and the squeezing `<a²>` using the relation:\n    `ν² = (<n> + 1/2)² - |<a²>|²`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Given `α = 0.5`, so `α² = 0.25`.\n    *   Calculate the mean photon number:\n        `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25) ≈ 0.25 * (1 / tanh(0.25)) ≈ 0.25 * 4.0833 ≈ 1.0208`.\n    *   The squeezing term is `<a²> = α² = 0.25`.\n    *   Now, calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `ν`:\n        `ν² = (1.0208 + 0.5)² - (0.25)²`\n        `ν² = (1.5208)² - 0.0625`\n        `ν² ≈ 2.3128 - 0.0625 = 2.2503`\n        `ν ≈ √2.2503 ≈ 1.5001`.\n    *   This value is remarkably close to `1.5`. Let's use `ν = 1.5` to calculate the entropy:\n        `S(τ) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n        `S(τ) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n        `S(τ) = 2 * ln(2) - 0`\n        `S(τ) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`.\n\nThis result is very close to the provided option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
