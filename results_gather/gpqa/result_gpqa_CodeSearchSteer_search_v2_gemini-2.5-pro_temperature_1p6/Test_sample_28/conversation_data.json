    "To identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must find the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. This is achieved by analyzing how each mutation alters the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\nFirst, let's break down the intact gene's initial sequence into codons (three-nucleotide units):\n*   **Intact gene:** 5’- **ATG TTT CTC** GCT GGT ACT… -3’\n*   **Translation:** This translates to **Methionine (Start) - Phenylalanine - Leucine**…\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’- **ATG TTC TAC** GCT… -3’\n    *   **Codon change:** The original `TTT CTC` becomes `TTC TAC`.\n    *   **Amino acid change:** `TTT` and `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine, so the first change is silent. However, `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While a different amino acid could disrupt protein function, it is not guaranteed to do so.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’- **ATG TTC TAA** GCT… -3’\n    *   **Codon change:** The original `TTT CTC` becomes `TTC TAA`.\n    *   **Amino acid change:** As in Mutant 1, `TTT` becomes `TTC` (still Phenylalanine). The significant change is `CTC` (Leucine) becoming `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon** (also called a \"nonsense\" codon).\n    *   **Effect:** This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the cell's machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein will be severely truncated, containing only two amino acids instead of the full length. A drastically shortened protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’- **ATG TTT TAC** GCT GGT GTC… -3’\n    *   **Codon change:** The original `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n    *   **Amino acid change:** `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is another **missense mutation**. Similar to Mutant 1, this single amino acid swap might not be enough to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’- **ATG TTT TAC** GCT ACT… -3’\n    *   **Codon change:** The original `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n    *   **Amino acid change:** `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is identical to the mutation in Mutant 3 at this position, making it a **missense mutation**. It is unlikely to be more effective than a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the four mutants, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most definitive and probable way to completely knock out the gene's function. By introducing a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein, it ensures that a functional, full-length protein cannot be produced. Missense mutations, as seen in the other mutants, only change a single amino acid, and their effect on protein function is less certain.\n\n<<<C>>>"
