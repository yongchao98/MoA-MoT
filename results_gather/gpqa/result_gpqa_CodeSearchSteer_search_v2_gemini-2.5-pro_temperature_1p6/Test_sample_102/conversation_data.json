    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents and the nature of each reaction.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2). All substituents are in a meta position relative to each other (positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nA successful synthesis must install these groups in the correct 1,3,5-pattern. This often requires a multi-step strategy that carefully controls the regiochemistry at each step.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n**A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Bromobenzene:** This step is fine.\n2.  **Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene:** Bromine is an *o,p*-director, so nitration yields mainly the *para* product (and some *ortho*). This does not lead to the desired *meta* relationship between the bromo and nitro groups. This route will not produce the 1,3,5-substituted product in high yield.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Nitrobenzene:** This step is fine.\n2.  **Nitrobenzene → Aniline:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂).\n3.  **Aniline → Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction fails. The amino group (-NH₂) is a Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃). This deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution and prevents the acylation from occurring on the ring.\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n2.  **Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n3.  **Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt**\n4.  **Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene:** This step, a deamination reaction, reverts the product back to the starting material, benzene. The initial sequence is chemically redundant and serves no purpose in advancing the synthesis.\n\n**D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Acetophenone:** Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acetyl group (-COCH₃). This is a good first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone → Nitration:** At this stage, we have two groups on the ring: the *meta*-directing acetyl group and the *ortho,para*-directing bromo group.\n    *   The acetyl group directs the new substituent (nitro) to position 5.\n    *   The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    These directing effects are in conflict. Nitration under these conditions would result in a mixture of isomers, including 3-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone, 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone, and the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis of the specific target isomer. The subsequent steps in this option are also chemically illogical (e.g., reducing the nitro group that was just added).\n\n**Conclusion on Options:**\nAll the provided options contain significant chemical flaws that would prevent the high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. They involve reactions that would fail, produce the wrong isomers, or are chemically nonsensical. There appears to be an error in the question or the provided options, as none represent a valid, high-yield synthetic pathway.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" option despite its flaws, one might consider the start of a logical sequence. The sequence that most successfully begins to build the correct substitution pattern is option D, which correctly forms 3-bromoacetophenone in its first two steps. Despite the fact that the subsequent nitration step (iii) would lead to a mixture of isomers and not a high-yield reaction for the target compound, no other option provides a more plausible route. For instance, option A generates the wrong initial isomer, B fails at the acylation step, and C includes a pointless sequence that returns to the starting material. Given the flaws in all choices, and assuming a single best answer must be selected from the flawed set, the initial steps of D are the most synthetically sound for creating a 1,3-disubstituted pattern that is part of the final product.\n\nSince the prompt requires a definitive answer from the given choices, and acknowledging the severe limitations of each, there isn't a truly correct answer. No proposed reaction sequence leads to a high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<D>>>"
