    "This question has two parts. Let's analyze each part separately.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomers are isomers of a compound that readily interconvert, most often by the migration of a hydrogen atom (a proton) and the switching of a single bond and an adjacent double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two opposing ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Without an alpha-hydrogen, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons between the ketone groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) each have two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerism. It converts to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound and therefore very stable.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound will show optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate):** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    2.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  an ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism. It does, however, have a *cis* geometric isomer called dimethyl maleate.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
