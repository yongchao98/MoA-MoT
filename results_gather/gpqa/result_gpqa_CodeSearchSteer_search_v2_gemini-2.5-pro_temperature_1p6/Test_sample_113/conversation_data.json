    "The problem asks to identify the correct reagents for two separate organic reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n\nThis reaction is a **cyanohydrin formation**. It involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of a ketone (butan-2-one).\n1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The cyanide ion, provided by NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n2.  **Protonation:** The negatively charged alkoxide ion is then protonated by an acid to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin. Reagent **A** must be a proton source.\n\nCommonly, cyanohydrin reactions are carried out by generating HCN *in situ* from NaCN and a mineral acid, or by using NaCN followed by an acidic workup. H₃O⁺ represents an acidic aqueous solution (an acid workup) and is a suitable proton source for the second step. NaHSO₃ is used in forming bisulfite addition products and is not the correct reagent here. Therefore, reagent **A is H₃O⁺**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n\nThis reaction is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile** group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating.\n*   **Reagent B** is mixed with water to perform this hydrolysis. The goal is to convert the nitrile to a carboxylic acid while leaving the hydroxyl group intact.\n*   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis** is a standard method for this conversion and requires a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄.\n*   A weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is generally not strong enough to effectively hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n\nComparing the options, **HCl** is a strong acid and the appropriate reagent for this hydrolysis. Therefore, reagent **B is HCl**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n*   Reagent B is HCl.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
