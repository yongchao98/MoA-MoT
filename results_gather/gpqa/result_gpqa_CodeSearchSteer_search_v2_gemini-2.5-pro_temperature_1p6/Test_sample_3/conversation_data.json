    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles—isolated north or south poles—exist, two of the fundamental laws of electromagnetism known as Maxwell's equations would be altered. These changes would make the equations for electricity and magnetism more symmetrical.\n\nThe specific equations that would be different are:\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇ ⋅ B) is zero. This is the mathematical expression of the fact that there are no observed magnetic monopoles; magnetic field lines always form closed loops, never starting or ending at a single point. If magnetic monopoles existed, this law would be modified to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the magnetic charge density (ρₘ), similar to how Gauss's law for electricity relates the divergence of the electric field to electric charge. The equation would become: ∇ ⋅ B = ρₘ.\n\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t), a principle that underlies the operation of generators and transformers. The term \"circulation\" refers to the curl of the electric field. The existence of magnetic monopoles would imply the possibility of a \"magnetic current\" (Jₘ), created by the flow of these magnetic charges. This magnetic current would act as another source for a circulating electric field, modifying the equation to: ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - Jₘ.\n\nTherefore, the presence of magnetic monopoles would alter the equations related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<D>>>"
