    "When solving partial differential equations (PDEs) like the heat equation numerically, the problem is often discretized into a system of ordinary differential equations of the form `dU/dt = AU + ...`, where `U` is a vector of the solution at different points in space and `A` is a large matrix representing the spatial derivatives. The solution to this system involves the matrix exponential, `exp(tA)`.\n\nFor complex problems, `exp(tA)` is approximated by a rational (fractional) function, `R(A)`. The key to parallelizing the algorithm lies in the mathematical properties of this rational function.\n\nSpecifically, the rational function `R(A)` can be broken down using a partial fraction decomposition. This expansion represents the complex rational function as a sum of simpler terms:\n`R(A) = c_0*I + c_1*(A - d_1*I)^-1 + c_2*(A - d_2*I)^-1 + ... + c_k*(A - d_k*I)^-1`\n\nEach term in this sum, of the form `(A - d_i*I)^-1`, corresponds to solving a system of linear equations. Crucially, each of these linear systems is independent of the others and can therefore be solved simultaneously on a different processor. The final solution is then obtained by taking a linear combination of the results from each processor.\n\nTherefore, the ability to express the fractional approximation as a linear combination of partial fractions is the fundamental factor that converts the sequential process into a highly parallel one.\n\n*   **A) Stability analysis:** This is a necessary property for any useful numerical algorithm to ensure errors do not grow uncontrollably, but it is not the mechanism for parallelization.\n*   **B) Complex roots of fractional approximation:** The nature of the roots can affect stability, but it is the decomposition enabled by these roots, not the roots themselves, that allows for parallel computation.\n*   **D) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions:** This is a feature of the problem being solved and generally complicates the solution process rather than enabling parallelization.\n\nThe correct choice is the one that directly breaks the problem into independent, concurrently solvable parts.\n\n<<<C>>>"
