    "Based on the evidence from the chemical clues, Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). The reasoning is as follows:\n\n*   **Heavier Isotope:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. LiAlD₄ contains deuterium (D or ²H), which is a heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Reaction with Liquid Y:** Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), the close analog of X, is known to react violently with water. The deuterated version, LiAlD₄, reacts violently with heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Gas W:** The reaction produces a gas W whose molecules contain an equal number of neutrons and protons. When LiAlD₄ reacts with heavy water (D₂O), the gas produced is deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms, each with one proton and one neutron, resulting in a total of two protons and two neutrons.\n*   **Precipitate G and Substance B:** The reaction forms a precipitate G, which upon heating, releases B. In the reaction `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`, the precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (mixed with lithium deuteroxide). Heating aluminum hydroxide (and by analogy, aluminum deuteroxide) causes it to decompose and release water (or in this case, heavy water). This makes B heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Melting Point of B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Heavy water (D₂O) has a melting point of 276.97 K (3.82 °C), which is indeed very close to 277 K.\n*   **Organic Chemistry Reagent:** Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. LiAlH₄ is a powerful and common reducing agent in organic synthesis, used to reduce functional groups like carboxylic acids and ketones. LiAlD₄ is used for the same purpose, specifically to introduce deuterium atoms into a molecule.\n*   **Reaction with Keto Acid:** The reaction of a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) with substance X results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄ can reduce the carboxylic acid group of a keto acid to a primary alcohol, leaving the keto group intact and thus reducing the oxygen count from three to two.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nHaving identified Substance X as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄), the task is to find the cumulative atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n1.  **Elements present:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminium (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (as its isotope Deuterium, D, atomic number 1).\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** The lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminium (Z=13).\n3.  **Sum of Masses:**\n    *   The molecule contains four atoms of the lightest element's isotope, Deuterium (²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   The molecule contains one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminium (²⁷Al). The mass number of Aluminium is 27. The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n4.  **Cumulative Mass:** The sum is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
