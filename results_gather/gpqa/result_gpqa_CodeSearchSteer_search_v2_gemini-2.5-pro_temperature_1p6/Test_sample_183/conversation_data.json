    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### Target Molecule Analysis\n\n*   **Structure:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituent Positions:** The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Directing Effects:** Understanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial.\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **Tert-butyl (-tBu):** Activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **Amino (-NH₂):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **Sulfonic acid (-SO₃H):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n### Retrosynthetic Strategy\n\nA common final step for synthesizing an ether is the Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting a phenoxide with an alkyl halide.\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group can be installed by reacting the corresponding phenol (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol) with sodium hydroxide and ethyl bromide (`NaOH/EtBr`).\n*   **Penultimate Intermediate:** Therefore, the key precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\nThe phenol group is often created from an aniline (-NH₂) via diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`) followed by hydrolysis (`H₃O⁺, heat`).\n*   **Precursor to Phenol:** The phenol would be formed from **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\nThe central challenge is the synthesis of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline, which has a 1,2,3 substitution pattern. Creating this specific arrangement with high yield is difficult due to the directing effects of the substituents. For instance, if you were to nitrate a molecule containing an amino group and a tert-butyl group, the strong ortho/para directing effect of the amine would not favor substitution at the meta position.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's analyze the provided sequences to see if any can plausibly yield the target molecule. Most multi-step syntheses of complex aromatic compounds involve using blocking groups or starting with an isomer that can be rearranged.\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts by making aniline, then alkylating it. `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on aniline would primarily yield *p*-tert-butylaniline. Step `iv) HNO3/H2SO4` would then nitrate the position ortho to the amine, yielding 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline. The final product from this route would have the tert-butyl and nitro groups meta, not ortho as required.\n*   **Option B:** This sequence attempts to use a sulfonic acid as a blocking group. `ii) SO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene produces primarily the *para* isomer due to sterics. Step `iii) HNO3/H2SO4` nitrates the position ortho to the tert-butyl group, leading to 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. If the sulfonic acid were later removed, this would leave the tert-butyl and nitro groups in a meta relationship, which is incorrect. Furthermore, step `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` on a diazonium salt is not a standard reaction.\n*   **Option C:** This option is incorrect because it attempts a reduction (`viii) Fe/HCl`) after the amine (which would have been formed by reduction) has already been converted to a phenol and then an ether. It also has a nitration step at the very end, which is unlikely to give the correct regiochemistry.\n*   **Option D:** Let's analyze this sequence carefully, as it presents the most plausible, albeit complex, pathway despite apparent inconsistencies.\n    1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: This step nitrates tert-butylbenzene. While the major product is *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene, let's assume the synthesis proceeds with the **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** isomer, which is formed in smaller amounts but can be separated.\n    3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amine. *o*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: This step involves the nitration of *o*-tert-butylaniline. This is a problematic step. To control the reaction, the amine would typically first be protected (e.g., acetylated). However, if we proceed, the strong activating amino group directs ortho/para. The desired product requires nitration at position 3, which is meta to the amine. This step, as written, would not give a high yield of the desired product. There seems to be a flaw in the provided sequences.\n\nHowever, if we re-examine the options and assume there's a typo, no simple correction makes any option perfectly logical. Often in such questions, one must identify the \"most plausible\" route, even if it's flawed. The sequence of alkylation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, and etherification is a standard pattern in organic synthesis. Option D contains a sequence that follows this pattern to generate *an* isomer, even if it is not the target isomer and the final steps are misplaced. If we assume the question intends to synthesize an isomer like 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene (which is a plausible product from the major isomers at each step), then the sequence in D (steps i-vii) is the most logical synthetic route. The inclusion of steps viii and ix appears to be an error in the question's construction. Among the deeply flawed options, D presents a sequence of reactions that is the most coherent for a significant portion of its length.\n\nAfter careful consideration of standard synthetic methodologies and the options provided, none of the choices represent a viable, high-yield synthesis for the specified product. There is a high probability of an error in the question itself or the options. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" fit, one would look for the most logical sequence of functional group transformations. The sequence in option D is the most logical progression for producing a trisubstituted nitro-ether from benzene, despite leading to the wrong isomer and having extraneous steps at the end.\n\nGiven the flawed nature of all options, we must select the one that represents the most viable chemical logic, even if it doesn't match the target perfectly. The sequence of Friedel-Crafts, nitration, reduction, subsequent substitution, and functional group conversion is a standard paradigm. Option D follows this, whereas other options have more severe logical errors (e.g., reduction before nitration, nonsensical reactions on diazonium salts).\n\n<<<D>>>"
