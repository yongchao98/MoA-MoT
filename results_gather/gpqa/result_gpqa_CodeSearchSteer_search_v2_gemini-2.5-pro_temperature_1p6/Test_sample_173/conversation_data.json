    "This is a physics problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. All the necessary information is provided in the problem statement. No external search is needed.\n\n**1. Define initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   Nucleus at rest.\n    *   Initial rest mass: `M`\n    *   Initial rest energy: `E_i = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`\n    *   Initial momentum: `p_i = 0`\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   Given `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments move with kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest masses of the fragments:**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for `m1` and `m2`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nThe more massive fragment has a rest mass `m1 = 0.66 * M`.\n\n**3. Calculate the rest energies of the fragments:**\n\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n\nThe total energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy.\n`Q = E_i - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\n`Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p1| = |p2|`.\nTherefore, `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n\nUsing the classical kinetic energy formula:\n`2*m1*T1_classical = 2*m2*T2_classical`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2`\n`T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**6. Calculate the correct (relativistic) value of T1:**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between energy, momentum, and rest mass is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy `E = T + mc^2`.\nSubstituting this in, we get `(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, which simplifies to:\n`(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`\n\nFrom conservation of momentum `p1^2 = p2^2`, so `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`\n\nWe know:\n*   `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nSubstitute these values (all in units of GeV):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nCancel the `T1^2` terms:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**7. Calculate the difference:**\n\nDifference = (Correct T1) - (Classical T1)\nDifference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\n**8. Convert the result to MeV:**\n\n`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\nDifference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
