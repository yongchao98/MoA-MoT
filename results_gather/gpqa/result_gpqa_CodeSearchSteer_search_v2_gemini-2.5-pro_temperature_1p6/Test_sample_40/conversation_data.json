    "This problem is a classic example of relativistic velocity addition, famously demonstrated by the Fizeau experiment. To find the speed of light in the moving glass as seen by an observer in the laboratory, we must use the Einstein velocity-addition formula.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the frames of reference:**\n    *   The laboratory is the stationary frame (S).\n    *   The moving glass is the moving frame (S').\n\n2.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass, as measured within the glass's own frame (S'), is `u'`. This speed is determined by the index of refraction, `n`.\n\n3.  **Determine the speed of light in the glass (frame S'):**\n    *   The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c / u'`, which means `u' = c / n`.\n    *   The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`.\n    *   Therefore, the speed of light within the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n4.  **Apply the relativistic velocity-addition formula:**\n    *   The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u'*v)/c^2)`\n        where `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) as seen by the stationary observer in the lab.\n\n5.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    *   Substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the equation:\n        `u = ((1/n) + v) / (1 + ((1/n)*v)/1^2)`\n    *   This simplifies to:\n        `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n6.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    *   To simplify the fraction, find a common denominator for the numerator and the denominator, which is `n`:\n        Numerator: `1/n + v = (1 + n*v)/n`\n        Denominator: `1 + v/n = (n + v)/n`\n    *   Now, divide the new numerator by the new denominator:\n        `u = ((1 + n*v)/n) / ((n + v)/n)`\n    *   The `n` in the denominator of both parts cancels out, leaving:\n        `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
