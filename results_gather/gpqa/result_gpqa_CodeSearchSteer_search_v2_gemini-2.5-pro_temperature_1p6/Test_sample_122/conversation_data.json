    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Frames of Reference\n*   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame of reference from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n*   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference. The time measured in this frame is the \"proper time\" because the clock is at rest within this frame.\n\n### 2. List the Given Information\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper time (Δt'):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame is 50 seconds.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** Approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 3. Determine the Goal\nThe objective is to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for this is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n### 4. Calculate Time Dilation\nDue to the effects of special relativity, an observer in the Galaxy frame will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the time measured in the ejecta's moving frame (`Δt'`). This phenomenon is known as time dilation. The formula for time dilation is:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, substitute this into the Lorentz factor equation:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n`γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n### 6. Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)\nNow we can calculate the dilated time `Δt`:\n`Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n### 7. Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame\nFinally, calculate the distance `d` using the speed `v` and the dilated time `Δt`:\n`d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\nThis result is extremely close to option B. To be more precise without intermediate rounding:\n\n`d = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / √0.96) = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nComparing this value with the given options, the closest choice is 3,060,000 km.\n\n*   A) 3,000,000 km: This would be the answer if relativistic effects were ignored.\n*   **B) 3,060,000 km:** This answer correctly accounts for time dilation.\n*   C) 2,880,000 km: This value is incorrect.\n*   D) 2,940,000 km: This result would come from incorrectly applying the time dilation formula (i.e., making the time shorter instead of longer).\n\n<<<B>>>"
