    "An essential principle in physics is the conservation of energy, which also applies to the relativistic harmonic oscillator. The total energy of the system remains constant throughout its motion.\n\nWe can analyze the energy of the oscillator at two key positions:\n1.  **At the maximum amplitude ($x = A$)**: Here, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is zero ($v = 0$). The kinetic energy is therefore zero. The total energy of the system is the sum of its rest energy ($mc^2$) and the potential energy stored in the spring, which is at its maximum. The potential energy is given by the non-relativistic formula $U = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    So, the total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n2.  **At the equilibrium position ($x = 0$)**: Here, the potential energy is zero, and the mass has its maximum speed, $v_{max}$. The total energy is the relativistic energy of the mass moving at $v_{max}$. The total relativistic energy is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$.\n    So, the total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}mc^2$\n\nAccording to the principle of energy conservation, the total energy at both positions must be equal.\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\nTo solve for $v_{max}$, we can first divide by $mc^2$:\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nNow, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n$1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\nFinally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n$v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
