    "To determine the correct transition route and probability for the decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions, we must consider the electric dipole selection rules and the probabilities of the intermediate steps.\n\n### 1. Identify the Transition Path\n\nThe transition occurs in two steps, starting from the initial state |*n*,*l*,*m*⟩ = |3,0,0⟩ and ending at the final state |1,0,0⟩, through an intermediate state |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩.\n\n**Electric Dipole Selection Rules:**\nFor a transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n*   The orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1).\n*   The magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n*   The spin quantum number *m*s does not change.\n\n**Step 1: |3,0,0⟩ → |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩**\n*   The initial state has *l*=0. According to the selection rule Δ*l* = ±1, the intermediate state must have *l'*=1.\n*   The initial state has *m*=0. The selection rule Δ*m* = 0, ±1 means the intermediate state can have *m'* = 0, 1, or -1.\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has *n'*=2.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Step 2: |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\nWe check if a transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ is allowed:\n*   From any |2,1,*m'*⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩: The change in *l* is Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed. The change in *m* (Δ*m* = 0 - *m'*) is also allowed for *m'* = 0, ±1.\n\nAll three paths are valid according to the selection rules. The options provided list these specific routes.\n\n### 2. Determine the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability corresponding to a specific transition route. This refers to the branching ratio of the first step of the decay. The atom starts in the spherically symmetric |3,0,0⟩ state. Because of this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon.\n\n*   The three possible intermediate states, |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩, correspond to different spatial orientations of the atom's orbital angular momentum.\n*   Since the initial state has no preferred orientation, the transition probabilities to each of these three *m'* sublevels are equal. The rate of transition is independent of the magnetic quantum number *m*.\n*   There are three equally likely intermediate states. Therefore, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any single one of these states is 1/3.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\n*   **A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The transition path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3:** The transition path is valid, and the probability of entering this specific intermediate state is 1/3. This option is correct.\n*   **C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The transition path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) |?⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3:** The probability is incorrect (and there appears to be a typo in the initial state).\n\nThus, the correct description of one possible decay route and its corresponding probability is the transition through the |2,1,0⟩ state with a probability of 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
