    "This problem requires identifying a compound from four options based on its FTIR and ¹H NMR spectral data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadening is a key indicator of this functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, and its position is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe FTIR data strongly suggest that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is correct but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern indicates that a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A neighboring methine (CH) group (1 proton, n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n    *   A neighboring methylene (CH₂) group (2 protons, n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n    *   A neighboring methyl (CH₃) group (3 protons, n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n    So, a \"dtq\" proton must have a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group as neighbors.\n*   **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern indicates a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A neighboring methine (CH) group (1 proton, n=1), causing a **d**oublet.\n    *   A neighboring methylene (CH₂) group (2 protons, n=2), causing a **t**riplet.\n    *   Another, chemically non-equivalent methylene (CH₂) group (2 protons, n=2), causing another **t**riplet.\n    So, a \"dtt\" proton must have a CH and two different CH₂ groups as neighbors.\n\nThe correct compound must have both of these environments in its structure. Let's analyze the structure corresponding to each option. The condensed formulas provided can be ambiguous, so we will deduce the structure based on a systematic interpretation and then find the corresponding IUPAC name to be clear.\n\n*   **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    This formula represents the molecule **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**. Let's draw its structure and analyze the protons:\n    ```\n          HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)\n    ```\n    *   Let's analyze the proton on carbon 4 (**H4**): It is bonded to H3 (1H), the CH₂ group at C5 (2H), and its own methyl group (3H). This set of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) will split the signal into a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal description.\n    *   Now, let's analyze the proton on carbon 3 (**H3**): It is bonded to H4 (1H), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H), and the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H). This set of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) will split the signal into a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal description.\n    Since this structure has protons that would give rise to both a dtq and a dtt, it is a very strong candidate.\n\n*   **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n    This formula represents **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ```\n          HOOC(1)-CH(2)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)\n    ```\n    *   The proton at **H3** is coupled to H2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). This would result in a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule with the correct combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) to produce a dtq signal. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n    This formula represents **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ```\n          HOOC(1)-CH(2)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)\n    ```\n    *   The proton at **H3** is coupled to H2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and its own methyl group (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule with two different neighboring CH₂ groups, which is required to produce a dtt signal. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n    This formula represents **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ```\n          HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₃(5)\n    ```\n    *   No proton in this structure fits the neighbor requirements for either a dtq or a dtt. The proton at H3 would be a triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq), and the proton at H4 would be a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq). This option is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option A, **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**, contains protons that match both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
