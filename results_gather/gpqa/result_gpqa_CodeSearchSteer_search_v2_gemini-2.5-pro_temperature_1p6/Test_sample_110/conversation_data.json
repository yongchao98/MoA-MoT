    "The analysis of the reactions and the provided options has been performed.\n\n### **Reaction A Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Reagent:** t-BuOK (Potassium tert-butoxide), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition (also known as a 1,4-conjugate addition). The base will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.\n*   **Enolate Formation:** The ketone has two α-carbons, at positions 2 and 6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no protons.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 is tertiary and has one proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract the proton from C6 to form the enolate. The double bond of the enolate will be between C1 and C6.\n*   **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate (nucleophile) will attack the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor). The new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n*   **Product Structure:** The resulting product will have the original 2-ethyl-2-methyl groups at C2, the ketone at C1, and at C6, it will have the original methyl group and a new ethyl propanoate chain (-CH₂CH₂COOEt).\n*   **Product Naming:** To match the options, we need to name the product according to IUPAC rules, treating the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    1.  The main chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    2.  The cyclohexyl group is attached to the C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    3.  We number the substituent ring starting from the point of attachment (old C6 is the new C1).\n    4.  The methyl group that was on C6 of the starting ketone is now on C1 of the substituent ring (`1-methyl`).\n    5.  The carbonyl group (old C1) is now at position 2 (`2-oxo`).\n    6.  The ethyl and methyl groups (old C2) are now at position 3 (`3-ethyl`, `3-methyl`).\n    7.  Combining these, the substituent name is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    8.  Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name given for A in options C and D.\n\n### **Reaction B Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n*   **Reagents:** KOH (a base) and H₂O (for workup).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The base deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic nitronate anion.\n*   **Carbanion Formation:** KOH removes a proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane, forming the nucleophile `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n*   **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon (C3) of the (E)-but-2-enenitrile. A new C-C bond is formed between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the nitrile.\n*   **Product Structure:** After protonation (workup with H₂O), the product is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n*   **Product Naming:** To name this product, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile functional group.\n    1.  The chain is six carbons long, with a nitrile at the end, so it is a `hexanenitrile`.\n    2.  Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    3.  There is a methyl group at C3 (`3-methyl`).\n    4.  There is a nitro group at C4 (`4-nitro`).\n    5.  The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given for B in options A and C.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) A is incorrect, B is correct.\n*   B) A is incorrect, B is incorrect.\n*   C) A is correct, B is correct.\n*   D) A is correct, B is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
