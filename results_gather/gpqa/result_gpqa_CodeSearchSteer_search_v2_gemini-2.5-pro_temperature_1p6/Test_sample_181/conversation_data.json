    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under several key assumptions about the device and the charge transport mechanism. Analyzing the options reveals the correct set of conditions.\n\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The foundational Mott-Gurney model assumes that the current is carried by only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes).\n*   **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** For the current to be limited by the charge buildup (space charge) within the semiconductor and not by the injection process itself, the injecting contact must be Ohmic. This means the contact can supply an abundance of carriers and presents no significant energy barrier to injection. A Schottky contact, which has an injection barrier, violates this condition.\n*   **Trap-Free:** The simple $J \\propto V^2$ form of the Mott-Gurney law specifically applies to a scenario where there are no charge traps within the material's band gap. If traps are present, they capture some of the injected carriers, and the current-voltage relationship becomes more complex.\n*   **Negligible Diffusion Current:** The model assumes that the dominant transport mechanism is carrier drift, which is motion caused by the applied electric field. It neglects the contribution of diffusion current, which arises from carrier concentration gradients. Therefore, the drift current is the primary component and cannot be considered negligible.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   A is incorrect because it specifies a Schottky contact.\n*   B is incorrect because the basic Mott-Gurney law is for single-carrier, not two-carrier, devices.\n*   D is incorrect because it states that drift current is negligible, which is the opposite of the model's main assumption.\n*   C correctly identifies all the key conditions: a trap-free material, a single dominant carrier type, a contact with no injection barrier (Ohmic), and negligible current from diffusion.\n\n<<<C>>>"
