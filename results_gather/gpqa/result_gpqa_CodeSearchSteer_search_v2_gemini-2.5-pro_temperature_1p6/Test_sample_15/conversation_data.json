    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from the presence of one or more chiral centers and a lack of an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Here is a breakdown of each compound:\n\n*   ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule does not possess any chiral centers. The carbons of the double bond are not chiral, and no other carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. Therefore, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   ***(3aR,7aS,E)*-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex bicyclic molecule includes the stereochemical descriptors *(3aR,7aS)*. These absolute configuration labels indicate the presence of specific chiral centers, defining a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n*   ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule contains two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the *(2R,3S)* configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and thus optically inactive despite having chiral centers.\n*   ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule also has two chiral centers. The *(2R,3R)* configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry, unlike its meso diastereomer. It is a chiral molecule and therefore optically active.\n*   ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The `(R)` in the name specifies the absolute configuration at a chiral center, which is the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1). As this is a specific enantiomer, it is optically active.\n*   ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is also known as *cis,cis*-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this ketone is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. An analysis of this structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, meaning there are no chiral centers. Consequently, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the compounds that are optically active:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nA total of 3 compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
