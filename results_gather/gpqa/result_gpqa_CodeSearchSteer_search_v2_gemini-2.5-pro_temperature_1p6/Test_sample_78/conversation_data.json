    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analysis of the Product's NMR Spectra**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the product from the given nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two doublets at δ 7.08 (2H) and δ 7.71 (2H) are characteristic of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   The two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H) correspond to two distinct methyl (CH₃) groups that are not adjacent to any protons, hence they appear as singlets. One of these is likely attached to the aromatic ring (a tolyl group), and the other is part of an acetyl group.\n    *   The two doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and δ 7.68 (1H) indicate two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons) that are coupled to each other.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   A signal at δ 197.7 is indicative of a ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n    *   The signals at δ 21.3 and δ 28.4 correspond to the two methyl carbons. The chemical shift of ~21 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   The presence of four signals in the aromatic/vinylic region (δ 126.9 to δ 144.1), with two of them representing two carbons each (δ 126.9 and δ 129.1), confirms the para-substituted aromatic ring and the vinylic carbons.\n\nBased on this spectral data, the product is identified as **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**. Its structure consists of a *p*-tolyl group (a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position) attached to a butenone chain. The molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O, which matches that of the starting material, Compound X, indicating the reaction is an isomerization or rearrangement.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Reaction and Potential Precursors**\n\nThe reaction involves heating Compound X with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) in a nonpolar solvent. DABCO is a sterically hindered, non-nucleophilic base. At high temperatures (403 K or 130 °C), these conditions are suitable for promoting rearrangement reactions, particularly of epoxides. This type of reaction is known as the Meinwald rearrangement, where epoxides rearrange into carbonyl compounds like ketones or aldehydes.\n\nNow let's examine the potential structures for Compound X provided in the options:\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound (C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH₃)) contains a phenyl group, not the p-tolyl group required to form the product. Therefore, it can be ruled out.\n*   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** The name is ambiguous, and the most direct interpretation, 2-(phenylethenyl)oxirane (C₁₀H₁₀O), does not match the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** This compound's structure is p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂. It possesses the correct molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O) and the necessary carbon skeleton, including the *p*-tolyl group, to rearrange into the identified product.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound (C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂) has the correct formula C₁₁H₁₂O. However, its carbon skeleton (a phenyl group and a branched chain) does not match that of the product (a tolyl group and a straight chain). A complex skeletal reorganization would be required, which is highly unlikely under these reaction conditions.\n\n**3. The Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe most plausible precursor is **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (C)**. The rearrangement to (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one can be explained by a base-catalyzed mechanism. DABCO acts as a base to abstract the most acidic proton, which is the one on the carbon of the epoxide ring that is also allylic to the vinyl group. The resulting carbanion intermediate undergoes ring-opening to form an enolate anion. Subsequent protonation yields an enol, which rapidly tautomerizes to the more stable ketone product. Such base-mediated rearrangements of vinylic epoxides are well-documented.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
