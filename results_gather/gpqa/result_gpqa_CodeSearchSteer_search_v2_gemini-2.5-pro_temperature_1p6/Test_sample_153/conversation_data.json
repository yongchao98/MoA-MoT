    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry Analysis**\n*   A molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of about one-third (32%) of the molecular ion peak is a characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing one chlorine atom.\n*   All four potential options—phenyl chloroformate, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 2-chlorobenzoic acid—have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with this data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak in the range of 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. This is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n*   There is also a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) group, specifically from a carboxylic acid.\n*   Based on these two peaks, the compound is almost certainly a carboxylic acid. This eliminates phenyl chloroformate (lacks an O-H group) and 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (a phenolic O-H is typically less broad, and the other peaks would differ). This narrows the possibilities down to 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   A singlet signal at a significant downfield shift of 11.0 ppm, integrating to one proton (1H), is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   The aromatic region displays two distinct signals: a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n*   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is indicative of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para*-substituted molecule results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.\n*   **4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits this pattern perfectly. It is a *para*-substituted benzene. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are shifted downfield (around 8.02 ppm), while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom appear slightly further upfield (around 7.72 ppm).\n*   **2-chlorobenzoic acid**, being *ortho*-substituted, lacks this symmetry. It would show four separate signals for each of its aromatic protons, resulting in a more complex multiplet pattern, not two simple doublets.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral data—the molecular weight and chlorine presence from the mass spectrum, the carboxylic acid functional group from the IR spectrum, and the *para*-substitution pattern from the ¹H NMR spectrum—unequivocally point to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
