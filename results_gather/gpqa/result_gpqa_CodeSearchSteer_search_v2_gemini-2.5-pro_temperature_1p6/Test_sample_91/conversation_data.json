    "Here is the step-by-step calculation for the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### 1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass\n\nFirst, we need to determine the chemical formula of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   Count the Carbon (C) atoms: 2 (from the first (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 (from the central CH) + 1 (from its CH3) + 1 + 1 + 1 (from the last C) + 2 (from the last (CH3)2) = **12 Carbon atoms**.\n*   Count the Hydrogen (H) atoms: 2*3 (from the first (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 (from the central CH) + 3 (from its CH3) + 2 + 1 + 2*3 (from the last (CH3)2) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 Hydrogen atoms**.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nThe molar mass of C12H22 is calculated using the atomic masses of Carbon (≈12 g/mol) and Hydrogen (≈1 g/mol).\nMolar Mass = (12 * 12 g/mol) + (22 * 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n### 2. Count the Chemical Bonds\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule by examining its structure:\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure contains two double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can count them from the structure:\n    *   Two bonds connecting the first two methyl groups.\n    *   One bond between `CH` and `CH2`.\n    *   One bond between `CH2` and `CH(CH3)`.\n    *   One bond for the methyl branch.\n    *   One bond between `CH(CH3)` and the next `CH2`.\n    *   One bond between `CH2` and `CH=`.\n    *   Two bonds connecting the last two methyl groups.\n    *   Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Molecule\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the molecule is the energy required to break all of its bonds. We use the given bond energies:\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Molecule) = 8800 + 600 + 1800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated from the elements in their standard states (C as graphite, H as H2 gas). We need to find the energy required to turn these elements into gaseous atoms.\n*   **For Carbon:** The enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol. For 12 carbons:\n    *   12 * 1000 kJ/mol = **12000 kJ**.\n*   **For Hydrogen:** The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to break one mole of H2 into 2 moles of H atoms. To form 22 moles of H atoms, we need 11 moles of H2.\n    *   11 * 100 kJ/mol = **1100 kJ**.\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Reactants) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the reactants and the enthalpy of atomization of the product molecule.\n\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/mol) = [Enthalpy of Atomization (Reactants)] - [Enthalpy of Atomization (Molecule)]\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/mol) = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### 6. Convert to kJ/g\n\nThe options include answers in kJ/g. We convert our result using the molar mass (166 g/mol).\n\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
