    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of distance (`r`) changes, we need to relate it to the given information about how the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`).\n\n### 1. Fundamental Relationships\n\n*   **Parallax and Distance:** Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. We can express this relationship as:\n    `plx ∝ 1/r`  or  `r ∝ 1/plx`\n\n*   **Number of Stars vs. Parallax:** The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵. This is best interpreted as the number of stars per unit of parallax, which we can write as a proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n    where `N` is the number of stars.\n\n### 2. The Transformation\n\nWe want to find how the number of stars changes with distance, which is the quantity `dN/dr`. We can find this by transforming the variable from parallax to distance using the chain rule of calculus:\n\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Derivative\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance, `d(plx)/dr`. Since `plx = k/r` (where `k` is a constant of proportionality), the derivative is:\n\n`d(plx)/dr = -k / r²`\n\nSince the number of stars must be a positive quantity, we are interested in the magnitude of this relationship for the proportionality:\n\n`|d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r²`\n\n### 4. Combining the Proportions\n\nNow, we substitute the proportionalities back into the chain rule equation:\n\n`dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n`dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\nFinally, we replace the parallax `plx` with its proportionality to distance (`plx ∝ 1/r`):\n\n`dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)`\n`dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n`dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes in proportion to `r³`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
