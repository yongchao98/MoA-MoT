    "To determine the probability of obtaining specific outcomes in sequential quantum measurements, we follow the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the concept of state collapse after a measurement.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n### 1. Initial State and Operators\nFirst, we define the initial state of the system and the operators for the observables P and Q.\n\nThe initial state vector at time t is given as:\n|ψ⟩ = `[-1, 2, 1]`ᵀ\n\nThis vector needs to be normalized. The squared norm is ||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\nThe normalized state vector is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `[-1, 2, 1]`ᵀ\n\nThe operators are given by the matrices:\nP =\n```\n[ 0,  1/√2,  0 ]\n[ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]\n[ 0,  1/√2,  0 ]\n```\nQ =\n```\n[ 1,  0,  0 ]\n[ 0,  0,  0 ]\n[ 0,  0, -1 ]\n```\n\n### 2. Measurement of Observable P\nThe problem asks for the probability of measuring the value 0 for P. According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator.\n\n**Eigenvalues and Eigenvector of P:**\nWe need to find the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue p=0. The eigenvalue equation is P|v⟩ = p|v⟩. For p=0, we have P|v⟩ = 0:\n```\n[ 0,  1/√2,  0 ] [x]   [0]\n[ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ] [y] = [0]\n[ 0,  1/√2,  0 ] [z]   [0]\n```\nFrom the first and third rows, we get (1/√2)y = 0, which means y = 0.\nFrom the second row, we get (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0, which implies x = -z.\nThe un-normalized eigenvector for p=0 is `[1, 0, -1]`ᵀ.\n\nNormalizing this eigenvector:\n||v||² = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2.\nThe normalized eigenvector |p=0⟩ is (1/√2) * `[1, 0, -1]`ᵀ.\n\n**Probability of Measuring P=0:**\nThe probability of measuring p=0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the eigenvector |p=0⟩ and the initial state |ψ_norm⟩.\nP(p=0) = |⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩|²\n\n⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩ = [ (1/√2) * `[1, 0, -1]` ] ⋅ [ (1/√6) * `[-1, 2, 1]`ᵀ ]\n= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)\n= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3\n\nThe probability is:\nP(p=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3\n\n### 3. State Collapse\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector. The new state of the system |ψ'⟩ is:\n|ψ'⟩ = |p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * `[1, 0, -1]`ᵀ\n\n### 4. Measurement of Observable Q\nNow, we measure the observable Q on the new state |ψ'⟩. We need to find the probability of getting the result -1.\n\n**Eigenvector of Q:**\nThe operator Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue q=-1 is:\n|q=-1⟩ = `[0, 0, 1]`ᵀ\n\n**Probability of Measuring Q=-1:**\nThe probability of measuring q=-1 in the state |ψ'⟩ is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product of |q=-1⟩ and |ψ'⟩.\nP(q=-1 | state is |p=0⟩) = |⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩|²\n\n⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩ = `[0, 0, 1]` ⋅ [ (1/√2) * `[1, 0, -1]`ᵀ ]\n= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))\n= -1/√2\n\nThe probability is:\nP(q=-1 | state is |p=0⟩) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2\n\n### 5. Joint Probability\nThe probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n\nP(p=0 then q=-1) = P(p=0) * P(q=-1 | state is |p=0⟩)\nP(p=0 then q=-1) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\nThus, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
