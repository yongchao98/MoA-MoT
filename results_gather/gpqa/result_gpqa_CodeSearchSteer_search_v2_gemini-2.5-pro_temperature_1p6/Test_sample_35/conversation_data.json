    "The energy of the observed absorption line must be corrected for cosmological redshift to determine its rest-frame energy, which corresponds to the energy of the transition as it would be observed in our own galaxy, the Milky Way.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):** An object at a distance of 2.1 Gigaparsecs (Gpc) has a significant redshift. While the exact value depends on the specific cosmological parameters used, we can find a reasonable approximation. The redshift (z) relates the observed energy (E_obs) and the rest-frame energy (E_rest) by the formula: E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z).\n\n2.  **Identify the Rest-Frame Energy and Transition:** The most prominent spectral line in radio astronomy with an energy in the micro-electron volt (µeV) range is the 21-cm line, which arises from the hyperfine transition in neutral atomic hydrogen (H I). The energy of this transition is approximately 5.9 µeV (5.87 x 10⁻⁶ eV).\n\n    Using the observed energy of 3.9 µeV, we can see if it is consistent with the 21-cm line:\n    1 + z = E_rest / E_obs = (5.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV) / (3.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV) ≈ 1.51\n    This gives a redshift of z ≈ 0.51, which is a plausible redshift for an object at a distance of 2.1 Gpc. Therefore, the observed line is the redshifted 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen.\n\n3.  **Identify the Interstellar Medium in the Milky Way:** The question asks what is most likely observed with *this absorption line* in the Milky Way. Since the line is from atomic hydrogen, this rules out the molecular medium options. The neutral atomic interstellar medium is known to exist in two main phases: a Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) and a Warm Neutral Medium (WNM).\n\n    While both phases can be involved with the 21-cm line, strong absorption features are characteristic of the cold phase. For absorption to occur, the absorbing gas must be colder than the background source of radiation. The Cold Neutral Medium, with temperatures around 100 K, is very effective at producing deep 21-cm absorption lines against warmer background sources. The warm phase, in contrast, is more commonly associated with broad emission lines. Therefore, observing a distinct 21-cm absorption line in the Milky Way points to the presence of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<A>>>"
