    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r), we can use the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. This theorem is particularly useful because the vector field has a singularity at the origin (r=0).\n\nThe vector field is described as having a magnitude that falls off as 1/r², and its direction is purely radial. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n**f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**\nwhere **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThe problem asks to evaluate ∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV, where V is the volume of a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence ∇ ⋅ **f** in spherical coordinates gives zero for any point where r ≠ 0. However, the divergence is undefined at the origin (r = 0), which is the location of a source. Because of this singularity, applying the Divergence Theorem is the appropriate method.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the surface integral of the vector field over the closed surface S that encloses the volume:\n∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nHere, S is the surface of the sphere of radius R. The differential surface area element d**S** on a sphere is directed radially outwards and is given by:\nd**S** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**\n\nThe vector field **f** evaluated on the surface of the sphere (where r = R) is:\n**f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**\n\nNow, we compute the dot product **f** ⋅ d**S**:\n**f** ⋅ d**S** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**]\nSince **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, the dot product simplifies to:\n**f** ⋅ d**S** = (1/R²) * R² * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nNext, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the spherical coordinates are 0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π and 0 ≤ θ ≤ π.\n\n∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = ∫₀²π ∫₀π sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nFirst, we evaluate the integral with respect to θ:\n∫₀π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]₀π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nNow, we integrate this result with respect to φ:\n∫₀²π 2 dφ = 2 [φ]₀²π = 2 (2π - 0) = 4π\n\nThus, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is 4π. This non-zero result, despite the divergence being zero almost everywhere, is due to the singularity at the origin, which acts as a source for the field. The divergence of **r̂**/r² is formally 4πδ³(**r**), where δ³(**r**) is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 4 π\n\nThe most appropriate answer is 4π.\n\n<<<D>>>"
