    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the relationship between the number of stars and their parallax, assuming a uniform spatial distribution of stars.\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution**: We begin with the assumption that stars are distributed uniformly throughout space. This means the number of stars per unit volume, known as the number density (represented by the Greek letter rho, ρ), is constant.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Spherical Shell**: Consider a thin spherical shell of space with a radius *d* and a small thickness *dd*. The volume of this shell (*dV*) can be calculated as the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (*dd*).\n    *   *dV* = 4πd² *dd*\n    The number of stars (*dN*) within this shell is the product of the number density (ρ) and the volume of the shell (*dV*).\n    *   *dN* = ρ * 4πd² *dd*\n\n3.  **Relating Distance and Parallax**: Parallax (*plx*) is inversely proportional to the distance (*d*) to a star. The formula is:\n    *   *plx* = 1/*d*\n    From this, we can express the distance as:\n    *   *d* = 1/*plx*\n\n4.  **Relating Distance Interval to Parallax Interval**: To find how the number of stars changes with parallax, we need to relate the interval of distance (*dd*) to an interval of parallax (*d(plx)*). We can do this by differentiating the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n    *   *d(d)/d(plx)* = -1/*plx*²\n    The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For this calculation, we are interested in the magnitude of the relationship, so we take the absolute value:\n    *   *dd* = (1/*plx*²) *d(plx)*\n\n5.  **Combining the Equations**: Now we can substitute the expressions for *d* and *dd* back into the equation for the number of stars (*dN*).\n    *   We start with: *dN* = ρ * 4πd² *dd*\n    *   Substitute *d* = 1/*plx*: *dN* = ρ * 4π(1/*plx*)² *dd*\n    *   Substitute *dd* = (1/*plx*²) *d(plx)*: *dN* = ρ * 4π(1/*plx*²) * (1/*plx*²) *d(plx)*\n    *   Simplifying this gives: *dN* = (4πρ / *plx*⁴) *d(plx)*\n\n6.  **Final Relationship**: To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (*dN/d(plx)*), we rearrange the final equation:\n    *   *dN/d(plx)* = 4πρ / *plx*⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, this shows that the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to 1/*plx*⁴. This relationship is a known result in stellar astronomy.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<C>>>"
