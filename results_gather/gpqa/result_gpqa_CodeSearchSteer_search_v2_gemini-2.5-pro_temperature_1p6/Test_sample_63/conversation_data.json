    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from heating the salts was passed through three tubes sequentially. Let's analyze the effect on each tube to identify the gases produced.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂ (Magnesium Perchlorate)**\n    This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (Limewater)**\n    This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂, which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃ or CaSO₃). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot Copper (Cu)**\n    Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO was formed and the weight increased by 0.80 g. This increase is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol\n    The gas that reacted must have been an oxygen-containing gas that is not water (removed in tube 1) or acidic (would have reacted in tube 2). Common possibilities are O₂ or nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction with hot copper and N₂O is: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C)**\n    The final remaining gas had a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n    This gas is inert to all three tubes, which strongly suggests it is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Deducing the Decomposition Reaction and Salt Composition**\n\nLet's consolidate the elemental composition of the gaseous products:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** From 0.2 mol of H₂O, we have 2 * 0.2 = 0.4 mol of H atoms.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** From 0.2 mol of H₂O (0.2 mol O atoms) and the 0.05 mol of O atoms that reacted with copper, we have a total of 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol of O atoms.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The products include 0.1 mol of N₂ gas and an unknown gas that provided 0.05 mol of oxygen. If we assume this gas was N₂O, the decomposition would be:\n    *   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. Assume the salts are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **.\n\nThe total mass of the initial mixture was 7.20 g, and the total mass of the calculated elements (H, O, N) is:\n*   Mass H = 0.4 mol * 1.01 g/mol = 0.404 g\n*   Mass O = 0.25 mol * 16.00 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   If we assume the final gas is N₂, Moles N = 0.1 mol N₂ from the N₂O reaction + some initial N₂. Total N atoms must come from the original salts.\n    Let's use our assumed products: If we have 0.05 mol of N₂O (providing the 0.05 mol of O for the copper), this would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂ in tube 3. This means the final 0.1 mol of N₂ is composed of this 0.05 mol plus an initial 0.05 mol of N₂ from the decomposition.\n    *   Products: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n    *   Total Moles of N atoms = (2 * 0.05 from N₂O) + (2 * 0.05 from N₂) = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Mass N = 0.2 mol * 14.01 g/mol = 2.802 g.\n*   Total mass of gaseous products = 3.60 g (H₂O) + (Mass of N₂ + N₂O). Mass of N₂ = 0.05 * 28.02 = 1.401g. Mass of N₂O = 0.05 * 44.02 = 2.201g. Total gas mass = 3.60 + 1.401 + 2.201 ≈ 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass.\nThe salts are composed only of N, H, and O.\n\n### **3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe mixture was equimolar, meaning moles of salt A = moles of salt B = *n*.\n\n*   The decomposition of 2*n moles of salt mixture produced:\n    *   0.2 mol H₂O\n    *   0.05 mol N₂\n    *   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   This matches perfectly with the decomposition of:\n    *   *n* = 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.1 mol H₂O\n    *   *n* = 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ → 0.05 mol N₂O + 0.1 mol H₂O\n*   Let's verify the total products:\n    *   Total N₂ = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total N₂O = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total H₂O = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n*   Let's re-trace the gases through the tubes:\n    1.  Tube 1 absorbs 0.2 mol H₂O (3.6 g).\n    2.  Gas mixture now is 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.05 mol N₂O. Neither is acidic. Tube 2 weight is unchanged.\n    3.  In Tube 3, 0.05 mol N₂O reacts with Cu, adding 0.05 mol of O (0.8 g) to the tube and producing 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    4.  The final gas consists of the initial 0.05 mol N₂ plus the 0.05 mol N₂ produced from N₂O, for a total of 0.1 mol N₂ (2.24 L at STP).\n\nAll calculations align. The two salts are Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n### **4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nNow, we count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in Salt A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in Salt B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of all atoms in salts A and B:**\n    *   Total = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
