    "To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars, we apply the principles of statistical mechanics to the stellar photospheres, assuming they are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1.  **Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):** The assumption of LTE allows us to use the Boltzmann distribution to describe the population of atoms in different energy levels within a localized region of the photosphere. The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level `b`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (level `a`) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    where:\n    *   N_b and N_a are the number of atoms in energy levels `b` and `a`.\n    *   g_b and g_a are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels (E_b - E_a).\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Stars:** We are given two stars, star_1 and star_2, with effective temperatures T_1 and T_2, respectively. The problem states that the relative population of a specific excited energy level for iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let's denote the ratio of the populations of the excited state to a lower state as *R*.\n\n    *   For Star 1: R₁ = (N_b / N_a)₁ = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n    *   For Star 2: R₂ = (N_b / N_a)₂ = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n3.  **Using the Given Ratio:** The problem states that R₁ = 2 * R₂. Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:\n\n    (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n    The statistical weights (g_b / g_a) cancel out:\n\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n4.  **Solving for the Temperatures:** To isolate the temperatures, we can rearrange the equation:\n\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) = 2\n\n    Using the property of exponents (exp(x) / exp(y) = exp(x - y)):\n\n    exp[(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k * T₂))] = 2\n    exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)] = 2\n\n    Taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)\n\n5.  **Substituting Given Values:** The problem provides the energy difference, ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is:\n\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    Substituting this value into our equation:\n\n    1 * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)\n\n6.  **Final Simplification:** We combine the fractions on the left side:\n\n    (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) = ln(2)\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
