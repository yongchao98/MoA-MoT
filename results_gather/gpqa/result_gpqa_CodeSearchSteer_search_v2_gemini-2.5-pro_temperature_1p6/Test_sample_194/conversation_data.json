    "To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Transit Condition:** A transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its star from our viewpoint. The geometry of a transit is described by the impact parameter (`b`), which is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, divided by the star's radius. For a planet's center to cross the stellar disk, the impact parameter `b` must be less than or equal to 1. An event with `b = 1` is called a grazing transit.\n\n2.  **Use Planet 1's Data:** We are given that the first planet has a transit impact parameter (`b1`) of 0.2. The impact parameter is defined as `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `R_s` is the stellar radius.\n    *   So, for Planet 1: `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s = 0.2`\n\n3.  **Determine the Condition for Maximum Period of Planet 2:** The question asks for the *maximum* orbital period of the second planet (`P2`) that still allows for transit and occultation events. Since the planets share the same orbital plane (same inclination `i`) and have circular orbits, an occultation (passing behind the star) will occur if a transit occurs. The maximum orbital period corresponds to the maximum possible semi-major axis (`a2`). This occurs at the limit for a transit, which is an impact parameter `b2 = 1`.\n    *   So, for Planet 2: `b2 = (a2 * cos(i)) / R_s = 1`\n\n4.  **Relate the Two Planets:** We now have two equations and can find the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n    *   From Planet 1: `a1 * cos(i) = 0.2 * R_s`\n    *   From Planet 2: `a2 * cos(i) = 1 * R_s`\n    *   Dividing the second equation by the first gives: `(a2 * cos(i)) / (a1 * cos(i)) = (1 * R_s) / (0.2 * R_s)`\n    *   This simplifies to `a2 / a1 = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n\n5.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its semi-major axis (`a`). For a given star, `P²` is proportional to `a³`. This can be written as `a` is proportional to `P^(2/3)`.\n    *   Therefore, `a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Maximum Period (P2):**\n    *   We know `a2 / a1 = 5` and the first planet's period (`P1`) is 3 days.\n    *   `5 = (P2 / 3)^(2/3)`\n    *   To solve for `P2`, we first raise both sides to the power of 3/2: `5^(3/2) = P2 / 3`\n    *   `P2 = 3 * 5^(3/2)`\n    *   `5^(3/2)` is `5 * sqrt(5)`, which is approximately `5 * 2.236 = 11.18`\n    *   `P2 ≈ 3 * 11.18`\n    *   `P2 ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe planetary and stellar radii given in the problem are not needed for this calculation, as the relationship relies on the ratio of the orbital distances, which can be determined directly from the impact parameters.\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet to exhibit transit and occultation events is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<D>>>"
