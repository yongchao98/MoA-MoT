    "### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone that has a single chiral center at the C5 carbon, in the (S) configuration. The reaction with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position. The hydride can attack the carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since these two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement at one of their two chiral centers, they are diastereomers.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. Treatment with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, yielding pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new chiral centers at carbons C2 and C4. Three possible stereoisomers can be formed:\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and thus constitute a pair of enantiomers.\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer, which has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. This is a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer.\nTherefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers, and the meso compound.\n\n### Chromatographic Separation\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined into a single mixture containing a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nThe separation of this mixture is then analyzed using two different High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) techniques.\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers**, like the two products from Reaction I, have different physical properties and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in two peaks.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) pair from Reaction II, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   The **meso compound** from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. As such, it has different physical properties and will be separated from them, yielding another peak.\n*   Furthermore, the products of Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) and Reaction II (pentanediols) are structurally different molecules with distinct polarities and will be separated from each other.\n\nCombining these points, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show **four peaks**:\n1.  Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  Peak 3: The co-eluting enantiomers (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  Peak 4: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### Chiral HPLC\nChiral HPLC utilizes a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers. The CSP creates a chiral environment where enantiomers interact differently, leading to their separation.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, just as in normal-phase HPLC. This gives two peaks.\n*   The key difference is that the chiral column will now separate the enantiomeric pair from Reaction II. This results in two distinct peaks for (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the others, will elute separately, giving one more peak.\n\nTherefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **five peaks**, one for each of the five stereoisomers present in the mixture:\n1.  Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  Peak 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  Peak 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  Peak 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis shows there will be 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
