    "To determine the time experienced by the astronaut, we need to perform a time dilation calculation. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### 1. Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The distance to the LMC is approximately 163,000 light-years. This means that from an observer on Earth's perspective, it would take light 163,000 years to travel this distance.\n\n### 2. Time of Travel from Earth's Perspective\n\nThe spacecraft travels at a constant speed of 0.99999987 *c*. From Earth's frame of reference, the time it would take for the spacecraft to reach Earth is the distance divided by the speed. Since the speed is very close to the speed of light, the travel time from Earth's perspective will be slightly more than 163,000 years.\n\nTime (Earth frame) = Distance / Speed\nTime (Earth frame) ≈ 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 *c*) ≈ 163,002.12 years\n\n### 3. Time Dilation Calculation\n\nTime dilation is a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's theory of special relativity, where time passes at different rates for different observers, depending on their relative motion. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nΔt' = γ * Δt₀\n\nWhere:\n*   Δt' is the time observed by the stationary observer (on Earth).\n*   Δt₀ is the proper time, the time experienced by the moving observer (the astronaut).\n*   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which is calculated as: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) for the spacecraft's speed (v = 0.99999987*c*):\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\nγ ≈ 1 / √(2.6 x 10⁻⁷)\nγ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\nγ ≈ 1961.16\n\nNow we can find the time experienced by the astronaut (Δt₀) by rearranging the time dilation formula:\n\nΔt₀ = Δt' / γ\nΔt₀ ≈ 163,002.12 years / 1961.16\nΔt₀ ≈ 83.12 years\n\n### 4. Astronaut's Age Upon Arrival\n\nThe astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey. The journey will take approximately 83.12 years from the astronaut's perspective.\n\nAge upon arrival = 22 years + 83.12 years = 105.12 years.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe aliens have an average lifespan of 150 solar years. Since the astronaut will be approximately 105 years old upon arrival, they will still be alive. The calculated travel time from the astronaut's point of view is approximately 83 years. Looking at the options provided:\n\nA) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth. (Incorrect)\nB) 81 years\nC) 72 years\nD) 77 years\n\nThe calculated value of ~83 years is closest to 81 years. The slight difference could be due to rounding of the initial distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud or the precise speed of light used in more exact calculations. Based on the provided options, 81 years is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
