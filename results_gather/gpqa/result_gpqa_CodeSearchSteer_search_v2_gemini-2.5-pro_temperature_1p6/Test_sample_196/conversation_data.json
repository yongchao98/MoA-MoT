    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing the IR and ¹H NMR Spectra of Compound X**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region suggests a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Signals:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to both a methyl group and a methine group.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** A methine group (-CH-) directly attached to the benzene ring (benzylic position) and coupled to the neighboring alkyl protons.\n    *   Assembling the alkyl group: The fragments suggest a *sec*-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   Conclusion from NMR: Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This matches option (B).\n\n**Step 2: Determining the Reaction and the Final Product**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** Compound X, identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reacted with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Transformation:** This specific reagent combination completely reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The rest of the molecule, including the benzene ring and the *sec*-butyl substituent, remains unchanged.\n*   **The Product:** The reduction of the -COOH group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid results in the formation of a methyl group at that position. The final product is therefore 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n**Step 3: Comparing with the Options**\n\n*   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches the predicted product of the reaction.\n*   B) **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   C) **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** This has an isobutyl group, not a *sec*-butyl group.\n*   D) **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** This is an isomer of the starting material but with a different structure.\n\nBased on the spectral analysis and the known outcome of the reaction, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
