    "The correct IUPAC name for the described molecule is **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nHere is the step-by-step determination:\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Compound**: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on a benzene ring makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. The carbon to which the carboxylic acid is attached is designated as position 1.\n\n2.  **Place the Substituents**:\n    *   **Para to -COOH**: A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para, so it is at position 4.\n    *   **Ortho to -COOH**: A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho, so they occupy positions 2 and 6.\n    *   **Meta to -COOH**: A carbaldehyde (-CHO, formyl group) and a cyano group (-CN) are meta, so they occupy positions 3 and 5.\n    *   **Constraint Check**: The final clue states that the methoxy (-OCH3 at C4) and the alcohol (-OH) are both ortho to the nitrile (-CN).\n        *   For this to be true, the nitrile group must be at position 5 (ortho to C4 and C6), which means the hydroxyl group must be at position 6.\n        *   This places the carbaldehyde (formyl) group at position 3 and the dimethylamino group at position 2.\n\n3.  **Determine the Numbering of the Ring**:\n    *   The principal functional group, carboxylic acid, is at C1.\n    *   The IUPAC rules state that the ring should be numbered to give the lowest possible locants to the substituents. Since all positions from C2 to C6 are substituted, the locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of whether numbering is clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   When the locant set is the same, a tie-breaker rule is used: the substituent that comes first alphabetically gets the lower number.\n    *   The substituents in alphabetical order are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, and **m**ethoxy.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise assigns position 2 to the dimethylamino group. Numbering clockwise would assign position 2 to the hydroxyl group.\n    *   Since \"dimethylamino\" comes before \"hydroxy\" alphabetically, the counter-clockwise numbering is correct.\n    *   This gives the final positions:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Name**: The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number.\n    *   5-cyano\n    *   2-(dimethylamino)\n    *   3-formyl\n    *   6-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n    *   The full name is **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**:\n    *   A) Incorrect numbering.\n    *   B) Incorrect alphabetical ordering of substituents in the name.\n    *   C) Matches the derived name exactly.\n    *   D) Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order.\n\n<<<C>>>"
