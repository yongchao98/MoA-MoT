    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Aromatic-H (Two signals):** The presence of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring) would mean the base formula is C₆H₄. Having only two signals for the aromatic protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution. In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of equivalent protons, which would give two distinct signals (typically two doublets). This accounts for 4 hydrogen atoms (C₆**H₄**).\n*   **Vinyl-H (Two signals, one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split only by the adjacent vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   The second vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (giving a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (giving a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   This vinyl group (-CH=CH-) accounts for 2 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **–CH₃ Groups (Two signals):**\n    *   One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH₃**), which accounts for 3 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The second methyl signal must belong to the other substituent. Given the presence of an ester group from the FTIR data, this is most likely a methyl group attached to the ester, either as a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-O-COCH₃). This accounts for another 3 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **No –CH₂ Groups:** The explicit absence of any signals for methylene (-CH₂) groups confirms that there are no ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains with -CH₂- units.\n\n### 2. Summation of Hydrogen Atoms\n\nBased on the ¹H NMR analysis, we can sum the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule:\n*   Aromatic protons: 4 H\n*   Vinyl protons: 2 H\n*   Methyl protons: 3 H + 3 H = 6 H\n*   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 H**\n\nThis hydrogen count immediately eliminates options A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and D (C₁₁H₁₄O₂), as they both contain 14 hydrogen atoms. The correct formula must be either C₁₁H₁₂O₂ or C₁₂H₁₂O₂.\n\n### 3. Assembling the Structure and Counting Carbon Atoms\n\nLet's assemble the identified fragments to determine the total number of carbon atoms. The two most plausible structures that fit all the data are:\n\n*   **Structure 1: Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**\n    *   Fragments: A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) and a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃) on a benzene ring.\n    *   Carbon Count:\n        *   Aromatic ring: 6 C\n        *   Propenyl group (-**C**H=**C**H-**C**H₃): 3 C\n        *   Methyl ester (-**C**OO**C**H₃): 2 C\n        *   **Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 C**\n\n*   **Structure 2: 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate**\n    *   Fragments: A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) and an acetate group (-O-CO-CH₃) attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   Carbon Count:\n        *   Aromatic ring: 6 C\n        *   Propenyl group (-**C**H=**C**H-**C**H₃): 3 C\n        *   Acetate group (-O-**C**O-**C**H₃): 2 C\n        *   **Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 C**\n\nBoth plausible structures result in a total of 11 carbon atoms.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe analysis indicates the molecule contains 11 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and (from the ester group) 2 oxygen atoms. This leads to the chemical formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nTo double-check, we can calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C₁₁H₁₂O₂:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\nThis matches the unsaturation in the proposed structure: 1 for the benzene ring (4), 1 for the vinyl C=C double bond, and 1 for the ester C=O double bond, totaling 6 degrees of unsaturation. The formula C₁₂H₁₂O₂ would have a DoU of 7, which is inconsistent with the structural features identified from the NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
