    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the effect of starspots on brightness\n\nA star's brightness is related to its temperature. Starspots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so a hemisphere covered in spots will be dimmer than an unspotted one. As the star rotates, we observe a periodic change in brightness. The maximum brightness (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, and the minimum brightness (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n\nThe energy radiated per unit area is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, F = σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the effective temperature.\n\n### 2. Calculate the brightness drop due to spots\n\nThe \"amplitude signal\" refers to the fractional drop in brightness, which can be expressed as `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This corresponds to the flux from the unspotted hemisphere, which is proportional to the fourth power of the star's effective temperature (T_eff). So, `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This comes from the spotted hemisphere. This hemisphere is composed of 80% normal photosphere (at T_eff) and 20% cool spots (at T_spot).\n    *   Star's effective temperature (T_eff) = 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature (T_spot) = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Spot filling factor (f) = 20% or 0.20\n    The flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\n*   **Calculate the amplitude:**\n    The relative amplitude of the brightness variation is:\n    `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    `Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = (f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n    Now, plug in the given values:\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * 0.51775`\n    `Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\nSo, the rotational modulation due to the spots causes a brightness dip of about 10.36%.\n\n### 3. Equate spot modulation to an exoplanet transit\n\nThe problem asks for the radius of a hypothetical planet that would produce the same amplitude signal if it were transiting an unspotted version of the star. The fractional dip in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet is approximately equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   **Transit Depth:** `Transit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n### 4. Solve for the relative planet radius (R_pl/R_star)\n\nWe set the transit depth equal to the amplitude of the starspot signal:\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355`\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the relative radius:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo produce the same amplitude signal as the spotted star, a hypothetical exoplanet would need a radius that is about 32% of the star's radius. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
