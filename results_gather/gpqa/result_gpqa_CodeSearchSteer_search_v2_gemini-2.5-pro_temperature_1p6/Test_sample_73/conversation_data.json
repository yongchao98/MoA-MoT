    "Radioactive decay is a memoryless process, which means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not affect its future decay probability. We can, therefore, calculate the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes as if we were starting from time zero.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the survival probability.**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. This means the probability of the atom *not* decaying (surviving) within 100 minutes is:\n    *   P(survival for 100 min) = 1 - P(decay in 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n2.  **Relate survival probability to the decay constant.**\n    The survival probability, S(t), over a time, t, is described by the exponential decay formula S(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n    *   For t = 100 minutes, we have 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100).\n\n3.  **Calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes.**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will survive for the next 150 minutes. We can use the information from the first step to find this without explicitly calculating the decay constant, λ.\n    Let S(100) be the survival probability for 100 minutes.\n    *   S(150) = e^(-λ * 150) = e^([-λ * 100] * 1.5) = (e^[-λ * 100])^1.5\n    *   Since S(100) = 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100), we have:\n    *   S(150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n4.  **Perform the calculation.**\n    *   S(150) ≈ 0.5598\n\n5.  **Calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes.**\n    The probability of the atom decaying within 150 minutes is 1 minus its survival probability for 150 minutes.\n    *   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5598 ≈ 0.4402\n\nThis probability is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
