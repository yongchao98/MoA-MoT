    "A dominant-negative mutation produces an altered protein that, in a heterozygous state, interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. The transcription factor described in the scenario must form a dimer to function. Mutation Y is located in the dimerization domain.\n\nHere is the breakdown of why the other options are less likely:\n*   **A) Protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** While degradation can be a consequence of some mutations, the primary mechanism of a dominant-negative effect in this context is interference, not necessarily triggering the degradation of the wild-type protein.\n*   **B) Change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** The problem explicitly states this is a dominant-*negative* mutation, which results in a loss of the protein's normal function, not a new or enhanced one (gain-of-function).\n*   **D) Loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This option is contradictory. Loss of dimerization is necessary for the protein's function, so it would lead to a loss-of-function phenotype, not a wild-type one.\n\nThe most probable molecular mechanism for the dominant-negative mutation Y is that the mutant subunit dimerizes with a wild-type subunit. This interaction can lead to misfolded, non-functional complexes that may aggregate. These aggregates effectively sequester the functional wild-type protein, preventing it from forming active wild-type/wild-type dimers and leading to a loss-of-function phenotype even with a normal allele present. This mechanism, where aberrantly folded proteins cause the aggregation of both the mutant and wild-type versions, is a known cause of dominant-negative effects.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is protein aggregation leading to a loss-of-function.\n\n<<<C>>>"
