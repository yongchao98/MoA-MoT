    "The observations provided point to a specific conclusion about the nature of the synthesized peptidic compound. Here is a breakdown of the evidence:\n\n*   **¹H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks of roughly equal intensity for a single alpha-proton. Since spin-spin coupling has been ruled out, this indicates the proton exists in two different chemical environments. The fact that the integrals of these two peaks sum to the expected value of one proton suggests the presence of a nearly 1:1 mixture of two different species.\n*   **LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) analysis separates the crude mixture into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This demonstrates that the mixture contains two components with different physical properties that allow them to be separated by chromatography. The mass spectrometry (MS) data reveals that both peaks have the same mass, which is consistent with the mass of the expected peptide. This confirms that the two components are isomers of each other—molecules with the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms.\n\nBased on this evidence, we can evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties. This means they can be separated by standard chromatographic techniques like LC and will have distinct signals in an NMR spectrum. This explanation is consistent with both the NMR data (two distinct peaks for the alpha-proton) and the LC-MS data (two separable peaks with the same mass). A common reason for this phenomenon in peptides is the presence of rotamers (or conformational isomers), which are a type of diastereomer that arises from slow rotation around a bond, such as a peptide bond.\n\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is unlikely because a precursor molecule would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum, which contradicts the LC-MS results.\n\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred:** This side reaction would result in a peptide with an extra amino acid, which would have a significantly higher mass. This is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry data showing the expected mass for both components.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in a non-chiral environment. Therefore, they would not be separated by a standard LC column and would show only a single set of peaks in a standard NMR experiment. This is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\nThe most plausible explanation that fits all the experimental observations is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
