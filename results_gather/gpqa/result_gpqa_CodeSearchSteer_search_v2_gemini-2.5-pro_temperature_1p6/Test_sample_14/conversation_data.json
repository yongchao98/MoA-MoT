    "The search results confirm the formulas I used.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability:** For a planet on a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its star is approximately the ratio of the star's radius (R*) to the planet's semi-major axis (a). This approximation is valid when the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's radius, which is a safe assumption for Earth-like planets.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the total mass of the system (M_star + M_planet). As the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass, the relation can be written as P² ∝ a³/M_star. This can be rearranged to a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3).\n\nThe derivation based on these principles is sound.\n\n**Recap of the derivation:**\n\n*   Transit probability of Planet 1: Pt1 ≈ R_s1 / a1\n*   Transit probability of Planet 2: Pt2 ≈ R_s2 / a2\n*   Ratio of probabilities: Pt1 / Pt2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)\n*   Given R_s1 = R_s2, the ratio simplifies to: Pt1 / Pt2 = a2 / a1\n*   From Kepler's Third Law, a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3).\n*   So, a2 / a1 = [(M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3)] / [(M_s1 * P1²)^(1/3)]\n*   This can be written as: a2 / a1 = (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)\n*   We are given: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2 (so M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2) and P1 = P2 / 3 (so P2 / P1 = 3).\n*   Substituting these values: a2 / a1 = (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3) = (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)\n*   Calculating the value: (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65\n\nThe probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nFinal Answer seems to be D.\n\nI have all the necessary information and have confirmed the underlying physics and formulas. The calculation is straightforward. I'm ready to provide the final answer.\n\nThe geometric transit probability for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the ratio of the host star's radius (R*) to the planet's semi-major axis (a):\n\nP_transit ≈ R* / a\n\nFor Planet_1 and Planet_2, the probabilities are:\nP_t1 ≈ R_s1 / a1\nP_t2 ≈ R_s2 / a2\n\nTo determine which planet is more likely to transit, we need to compare these two probabilities by taking their ratio:\nP_t1 / P_t2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that the host stars have the same radii (R_s1 = R_s2). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\nP_t1 / P_t2 = a2 / a1\n\nNow, we must find the relationship between the semi-major axes of the two planets using Kepler's Third Law. For a planet whose mass is negligible compared to its star, the law is:\nP² ≈ (4π² / G*M_s) * a³\n\nWhere:\n- P is the orbital period\n- a is the semi-major axis\n- M_s is the mass of the host star\n- G is the gravitational constant\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, 'a':\na³ ≈ (G*M_s*P²) / 4π²\na ≈ (G / 4π²)^(1/3) * (M_s * P²)^(1/3)\n\nSince (G / 4π²)^(1/3) is a constant, we can establish a proportionality:\na ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)\n\nNow we can write the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1) in terms of the stellar masses and orbital periods:\na2 / a1 = [(M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3)] / [(M_s1 * P1²)^(1/3)]\na2 / a1 = (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)\n\nFrom the information provided in the problem:\n- The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of the host star of Planet_2: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2, which means M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2.\n- The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: P1 = P2 / 3, which means P2 / P1 = 3.\n\nNow, we substitute these values back into the equation for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\na2 / a1 = (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)\na2 / a1 = (1/2)^(1/3) * (9)^(1/3)\na2 / a1 = (9/2)^(1/3)\na2 / a1 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5:\na2 / a1 ≈ 1.65096\n\nSince the probability ratio P_t1 / P_t2 is equal to a2 / a1, we have:\nP_t1 / P_t2 ≈ 1.65\n\nThis means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
