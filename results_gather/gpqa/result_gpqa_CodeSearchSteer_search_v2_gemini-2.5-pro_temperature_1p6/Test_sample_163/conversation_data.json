    "The provided search results confirm the physics principles I used.\n\n*   **Eclipsing + Spectroscopic is Key:** Several sources state that for a double-lined spectroscopic binary, you can get the mass ratio from the radial velocity amplitudes. However, to get the absolute masses, you need the inclination angle `i`. An eclipsing binary is one where the inclination is known to be close to 90 degrees, allowing for the determination of the actual masses.\n\n*   **Mass Ratio:** The ratio of the masses is the inverse of the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes: `m1 / m2 = K2 / K1`.\n\n*   **Total Mass Formula:** The sum of the masses is given by the formula: `m1 + m2 = (P / (2 * pi * G)) * (v_r_A + v_r_B)^3 / sin^3(i)`. Since the problem deals with eclipsing binaries, we can assume `sin(i) = 1`. This confirms that the total mass of a system is directly proportional to its period (P) and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K_A + K_B).\n\nThe logic and calculations are sound. I will proceed with formulating the final answer based on the calculation `Ratio = 0.432`. This corresponds to option C.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Identify the relationship between total mass and the observed properties.**\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic and eclipsing binary system, the total mass (M_total = m₁ + m₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂) by the following proportionality:\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n\nThis relationship comes from combining Kepler's Third Law with the definitions of radial velocity for a binary system, with the critical information that an eclipse implies an orbital inclination `i` of approximately 90 degrees (so sin³(i) ≈ 1).\n\n**2. Calculate the relevant parameters for System 1.**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   Therefore, M₁ ∝ 2 * (15)³\n\n**3. Calculate the relevant parameters for System 2.**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   Therefore, M₂ ∝ 1 * (25)³\n\n**4. Compute the ratio of the total masses.**\nThe question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which translates to calculating the ratio M₁ / M₂.\n\nRatio = M₁ / M₂ = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)\nRatio = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nRatio = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\nRatio = 0.432\n\n**5. Compare the result with the given options.**\nThe calculated ratio of ~0.432 is closest to option C.\n\nThe problem requires a step-by-step application of the principles of binary star dynamics to find the ratio of the total masses of two systems. Here is the detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physics**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system that also exhibits eclipses, the total mass of the system (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M_total = m₁ + m₂) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the sinusoidal radial velocity curves (K₁ and K₂). The crucial fact is that eclipses only occur when the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is close to 90°, and thus sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nThe governing relationship is derived from Kepler's Third Law and is given by:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nThis shows that the total mass is directly proportional to the orbital period and to the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Formula to System 1**\n\n*   **Period (P₁):** 2 years\n*   **Radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ₐ, K₁ᵦ):** 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   **Sum of amplitudes for System 1:** K_total₁ = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\nUsing the proportionality, the mass of System 1 (M₁) is:\nM₁ ∝ P₁ * (K_total₁ )³ = 2 * (15)³\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Formula to System 2**\n\n*   **Period (P₂):** 1 year\n*   **Radial velocity amplitudes (K₂ₐ, K₂ᵦ):** 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   **Sum of amplitudes for System 2:** K_total₂ = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nUsing the proportionality, the mass of System 2 (M₂) is:\nM₂ ∝ P₂ * (K_total₂)³ = 1 * (25)³\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of the Masses**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which System 1 is more massive than System 2, which is the ratio M₁ / M₂.\n\nRatio = M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n\nNow, we solve the expression:\n\nRatio = 2 * (15/25)³\nRatio = 2 * (3/5)³\nRatio = 2 * (27/125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThe result shows that System 1 is about 0.432 times as massive as System 2.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Closest Answer**\n\nComparing the calculated value of 0.432 to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe closest option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
