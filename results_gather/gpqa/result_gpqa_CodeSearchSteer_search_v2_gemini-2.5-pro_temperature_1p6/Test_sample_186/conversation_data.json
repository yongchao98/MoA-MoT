    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a single 8m VLT telescope, we must first establish the detection limit and then evaluate each star's visibility and brightness.\n\n### **ESPRESSO's Detection Limit**\n\nThe condition for detection is achieving a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a one-hour exposure. According to documentation for ESPRESSO, when used with a single VLT Unit Telescope (1-UT mode), it can achieve an S/N of 10 for a star with an apparent visual magnitude (V) of approximately 17 in about one hour. We will use **V ≤ 17** as the threshold for detectability.\n\n### **Visibility from Paranal Observatory**\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located in Chile at a latitude of about -24.6 degrees. This location in the Southern Hemisphere restricts which parts of the sky can be observed. A simple rule of thumb is that the declination of an observable object should be less than (90° - |latitude|). For Paranal, this means stars with declinations greater than approximately +65° are not visible.\n\n### **Analysis of the Stars**\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of about -52° 42'. As a southern star, it is easily visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky with an apparent visual magnitude of -0.74.\n*   **Detectability:** Since -0.74 is much brighter (a smaller number) than the limit of V=17, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of approximately +89° 15'. This is far north of the observability limit for Paranal Observatory.\n*   **Detectability:** Polaris is not visible from Paranal and is therefore **not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with Mv = 15 at 10 pc**\nTo determine detectability, we first need to calculate the apparent magnitude (mv) using the absolute magnitude (Mv) and distance (d) in parsecs. The formula is:\n*mv = Mv + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5*\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    mv = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(10) - 5\n    mv = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5\n    mv = 15\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 15 is brighter than the V=17 limit. The star's position at a declination of 0° makes it observable from Paranal. Thus, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with Mv = 15 at 200 pc**\n*   **Calculation:**\n    mv = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(200) - 5\n    mv = 15 + 5 * (2.30) - 5\n    mv = 15 + 11.5 - 5\n    mv = 21.5\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is fainter than the V=17 limit. Therefore, this star is **not detectable** under the specified conditions.\n\n**e) Star with Mv = 15 at 5 pc**\n*   **Calculation:**\n    mv = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(5) - 5\n    mv = 15 + 5 * (0.70) - 5\n    mv = 15 + 3.5 - 5\n    mv = 13.5\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the V=17 limit. The star's declination of 0° makes it visible from Paranal. This star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with Mv = 15 at 50 pc**\n*   **Calculation:**\n    mv = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(50) - 5\n    mv = 15 + 5 * (1.70) - 5\n    mv = 15 + 8.5 - 5\n    mv = 18.5\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the V=17 limit. This star is **not detectable**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe stars that are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph under the given conditions are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star (c) with Mv=15 at 10 pc (mv=15)\n3.  Star (e) with Mv=15 at 5 pc (mv=13.5)\n\nIn total, **3** of the listed stars would be detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
