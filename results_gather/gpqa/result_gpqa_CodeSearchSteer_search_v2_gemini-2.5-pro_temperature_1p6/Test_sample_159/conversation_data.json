    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Aperture's Shape:** The problem describes an N-sided polygon where all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, all apothems are inherently equal. As the number of sides N becomes infinitely large (N → ∞), a regular polygon approaches a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius 'r' of this circle.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Diffraction Phenomenon:** When light passes through a circular aperture, it creates a characteristic diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central spot, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima.\n\n3.  **Formulas for Minima in an Airy Pattern:** The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) in an Airy pattern are given by the formula:\n    sin(θ) ≈ θ = c * (λ / D)\n    where:\n    *   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n    *   λ is the wavelength of the monochromatic light.\n    *   D is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n    *   c is a coefficient that determines the order of the minimum. These coefficients are derived from the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind.\n\n4.  **Relating Aperture Parameters:**\n    *   As established, the polygon becomes a circle with radius r = a.\n    *   The diameter of this circular aperture is D = 2 * r = 2a.\n\n5.  **Finding the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    *   **First Minimum:** The coefficient for the first minimum is approximately 1.220. The angular position (θ₁) is:\n        θ₁ ≈ 1.220 * (λ / D) = 1.220 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a)\n    *   **Second Minimum:** The coefficient for the second minimum is approximately 2.233. The angular position (θ₂) is:\n        θ₂ ≈ 2.233 * (λ / D) = 2.233 * (λ / 2a) ≈ 1.117 * (λ / a)\n\n6.  **Calculating the Angular Distance:** The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is the difference between their angular positions (Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁).\n\n    *   Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁\n    *   Δθ ≈ (1.117 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\n    *   Δθ ≈ (1.117 - 0.610) * (λ / a)\n    *   Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ / a)\n\n7.  **Comparing with the Options:** The calculated value of approximately 0.507 λ / a is closest to option A.\n\n    *   A) 0.506 λ / a\n    *   B) 0.500 λ / a\n    *   C) 0.610 λ / a  *(This is the position of the first minimum, not the distance between the first two.)*\n    *   D) 1.220 λ / a\n\nThe most accurate answer is derived from the difference between the angular positions of the first and second minima of the Airy diffraction pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
