    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expectation value of the operator `A = 10σz + 5σx` for the given quantum state.\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is a linear superposition:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`\n\nThe states `|↑⟩` and `|↓⟩` are the eigenstates of the Pauli matrix `σz`. In this standard basis, the states and Pauli matrices can be represented as vectors and matrices:\n*   `|↑⟩ = [1, 0]`ᵀ\n*   `|↓⟩ = [0, 1]`ᵀ\n*   `σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n*   `σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe state vector `|ψ⟩` is:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1, 0]`ᵀ` + (√3)/2 * [0, 1]`ᵀ` = [0.5, √3/2]`ᵀ\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `O` is given by `⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`. For the operator `A = 10σz + 5σx`, the expectation value is:\n`⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|(10σz + 5σx)|ψ⟩`\n\nDue to the linearity of the inner product, this can be split into:\n`⟨A⟩ = 10 * ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ + 5 * ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩`\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of `σz` (`⟨σz⟩`):**\n\nThe expectation value `⟨σz⟩` for a state `|ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩` is given by `|a|² - |b|²`.\nFor our state, `a = 0.5` and `b = √3/2`.\n`⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)² - (√3/2)² = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of `σx` (`⟨σx⟩`):**\n\nTo find `⟨σx⟩`, we calculate `⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩`.\n`σx|ψ⟩ = σx(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩) = 0.5 * σx|↑⟩ + (√3/2) * σx|↓⟩`\nUsing the properties `σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩` and `σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩`, we get:\n`σx|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩`\nNow, we compute the inner product with `⟨ψ|`:\n`⟨σx⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|) * ((√3/2)|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩)`\nUsing the orthogonality of the basis states (`⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1`, `⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1`, `⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0`), the terms are:\n`⟨σx⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) * ⟨↑|↑⟩ + ((√3/2) * 0.5) * ⟨↓|↓⟩ = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n**3. Combine the results:**\n\nNow substitute the expectation values of `σz` and `σx` back into the expression for `⟨A⟩`:\n`⟨A⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`⟨A⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3`\n\nTo find the numerical answer, we use the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is **-0.7**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
