    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Isotopic labeling, in this case using deuterium (d), is a key technique for elucidating the mechanism of such reactions.\n\nThe reaction proceeds via two main pathways originating from the initial elimination step:\n\n**Pathway 1: Abstraction of a Proton (H)**\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), can abstract a proton from the C6 position (ortho to the bromine). The resulting anion eliminates the bromide ion to form a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in place.\n\n*   **Formation of Benzyne I:** This intermediate is 2-deuterobenzyne.\n*   **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can then attack either carbon of the triple bond in this unsymmetrical benzyne.\n    *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline** (o-deuteroaniline).\n    *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline** (m-deuteroaniline).\n\n**Pathway 2: Abstraction of a Deuteron (d)**\nAlternatively, the amide anion can abstract the deuteron from the C2 position. Because the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond, this pathway is kinetically less favored but still occurs. This elimination also results in a benzyne intermediate, this time with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Formation of Benzyne II:** This intermediate is a non-deuterated benzyne.\n*   **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) attacks this symmetrical benzyne. Attack at either C1 or C2 results in the formation of **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\nTherefore, three distinct organic products are possible from this reaction:\n1.  2-Deuteroaniline\n2.  3-Deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nThus, there are a total of three possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
