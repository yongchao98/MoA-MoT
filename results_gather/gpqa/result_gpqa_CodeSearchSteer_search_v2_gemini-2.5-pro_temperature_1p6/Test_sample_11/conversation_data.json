    "The problem has been solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. The given mass values for the positive pion (Pi+) and the positive muon (mu+) are 139.6 MeV/c² and 105.7 MeV/c², respectively. The search results confirm that these are the standard, accepted values. The search also confirms that for this type of two-body decay calculation, the neutrino (nu) is considered massless.\n\nThe calculation steps were as follows:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion (E_pi = M_pi * c²). The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_mu) and the neutrino (E_nu).\n    *   E_pi = E_mu + E_nu\n    *   139.6 MeV = (KE_mu + M_mu * c²) + E_nu\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the muon and neutrino must have momenta that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   p_mu = p_nu = p\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**:\n    *   For the massless neutrino, E_nu = p_nu * c = p*c.\n    *   For the muon, E_mu² = (p_mu * c)² + (M_mu * c²)².\n\nBy substituting and solving these equations, the momentum of each product particle was determined:\n*   p * c = [(M_pi * c²)² - (M_mu * c²)²] / [2 * M_pi * c²]\n*   p * c = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6] ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nWith the momentum known, the kinetic energies were calculated:\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)**: Since it is massless, its kinetic energy is its total energy.\n    *   KE_nu = E_nu = p * c ≈ 29.8 MeV\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_mu)**: This is its total energy minus its rest energy.\n    *   KE_mu = E_mu - M_mu * c²\n    *   From energy conservation, E_mu = E_pi - E_nu = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV\n    *   KE_mu = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These values are consistent with those found in physics resources for this specific decay.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values (4.1 MeV, 29.8 MeV) most closely match option A. Using slightly more precise values from the initial calculation (4.116 MeV) confirms this match.\n\n<<<A>>>"
