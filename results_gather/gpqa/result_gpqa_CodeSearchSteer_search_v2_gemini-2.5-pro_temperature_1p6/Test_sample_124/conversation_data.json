    "The problem asks for the energy and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) of the third excited state of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic potential, $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nHere, $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integer quantum numbers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe states are defined by the value of $n$:\n*   **Ground state:** $n = 0$.\n*   **First excited state:** $n = 1$.\n*   **Second excited state:** $n = 2$.\n*   **Third excited state:** $n = 3$.\n\nTo find the energy of the third excited state, we substitute $n = 3$ into the energy formula:\n$E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nNext, we need to determine the degeneracy of this energy level, which is the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $n = 3$. The formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the $n$-th energy level is:\n$g_n = (n+1)(n+2) / 2$\n\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$, the degeneracy is:\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2) / 2 = (4)(5) / 2 = 10$\n\nWe can also find this by listing the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ whose sum is 3:\n*   Sets with one non-zero quantum number: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). This gives 3 states.\n*   Sets with two non-zero quantum numbers: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). This gives 6 states.\n*   Sets with three non-zero quantum numbers: (1,1,1). This gives 1 state.\n\nThe total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 11 $\\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 3\nB) (9/2) $\\hbar \\omega$ , 10\nC) 11 $\\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 10\nD) (9/2) $\\hbar \\omega$, 3\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
