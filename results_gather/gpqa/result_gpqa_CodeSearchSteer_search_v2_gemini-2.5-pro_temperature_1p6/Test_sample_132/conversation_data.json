    "The search results confirm the standard two-step calculation method I used.\n1.  Use the concentrations of the weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻) with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (or the Ka expression) for the second dissociation of phosphoric acid to find the pH or [H⁺] of the buffer. The search results use a pKa₂ of ~7.2 for this step. The value given in the problem (Ka₂=6.2x10⁻⁸) corresponds to a pKa₂ of 7.21.\n2.  Use the calculated [H⁺] and the concentration of HPO₄²⁻ in the Ka expression for the third dissociation (HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻) to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻).\n\nThe approach is validated. I will proceed with the final calculation based on the values provided in the problem.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of each component:**\n\n*   **KH₂PO₄:** Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   This provides the moles of the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻).\n*   **Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:** Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   This provides the moles of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻).\n\n**2. Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\n\n*   The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n*   **[H₂PO₄⁻]** (the acid): 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **[HPO₄²⁻]** (the conjugate base): 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n\n*   This buffer system is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid:\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n*   Rearranging the acid dissociation constant expression: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H⁺] = 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration:**\n\n*   The concentration of orthophosphate (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant for this is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n*   Rearranging the expression Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]:\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   We can assume the concentration of HPO₄²⁻ at equilibrium is its initial concentration (0.02809 M) since its dissociation is minimal.\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nWhen rounded to three significant figures, the concentration is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This corresponds to option C.\n\nFinal check of the options.\nA) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculation is robust and confirmed by standard chemical principles found in the search results.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n<<<C>>>"
