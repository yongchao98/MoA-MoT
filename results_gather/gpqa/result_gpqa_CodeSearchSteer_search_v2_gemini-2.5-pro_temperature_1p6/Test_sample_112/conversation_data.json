    "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, the results from the characterization techniques must be analyzed.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n*   **FTIR Spectrum**: The very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, which often appears as a broad band from 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ due to hydrogen bonding. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch (1760-1690 cm⁻¹), which is also indicative of a carboxylic acid. The absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Vinylic protons typically show signals in the 4.5-7 ppm range.\n*   **Mass Spectrometry**: A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a strong indicator of a carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) fragment. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### Conclusion from Functional Groups:\nThe combined spectroscopic data strongly suggest that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. It contains:\n1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), identified by the broad O-H and C=O peaks in the FTIR and the m/z = 45 fragment in the mass spectrum.\n2.  A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), identified by the peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ in the FTIR and the presence of vinyl-hydrogens in the ¹H NMR.\n\n### Evaluating the Chemical Formulas:\nThe presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options A (C₆H₁₂O) and B (C₆H₁₀O). The choice is now between C (C₆H₁₀O₂) and D (C₆H₁₂O₂).\n\nTo distinguish between these two, we can use the concept of the **degree of unsaturation (DoU)**, which indicates the total number of rings and π (pi) bonds in a molecule. The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation for a molecule with the formula CₓHᵧO₂ is:\n\nDoU = C - (H/2) + 1  (Oxygen atoms do not affect this calculation).\n\n*   **For C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option C):**\n    DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n    A DoU of 2 corresponds to two double bonds, or one triple bond, or one double bond and one ring, etc. In this case, the spectroscopic evidence points to one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the vinyl group). This perfectly matches the DoU of 2.\n\n*   **For C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option D):**\n    DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n    A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of only one double bond or one ring. This would account for the C=O in the carboxylic acid but not the additional C=C double bond confirmed by the FTIR and ¹H NMR data. This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid, like hexanoic acid.\n\nBased on the evidence, the compound must have two degrees of unsaturation. Therefore, the chemical formula must be C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
