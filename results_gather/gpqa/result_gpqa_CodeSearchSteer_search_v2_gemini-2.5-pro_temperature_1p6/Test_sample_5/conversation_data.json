    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nWe use the standard transformations from polar to Cartesian coordinates:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nFrom which we derive:\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\nx^2 = r^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nSubstituting these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis potential is that of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is a sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction.\n\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\nV_x(x) = 1/2 (4k)x^2\nV_y(y) = 1/2 (k)y^2\n\nFor a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential V(z) = 1/2 mω^2z^2, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequencies (ω_x and ω_y) for the motion in each direction:\nFor the x-direction: 1/2 mω_x^2 x^2 = 1/2 (4k)x^2  => mω_x^2 = 4k => ω_x = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m)\nFor the y-direction: 1/2 mω_y^2 y^2 = 1/2 (k)y^2   => mω_y^2 = k   => ω_y = √(k/m)\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies for the two independent oscillators.\nE = E_x + E_y\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y\n\nSubstituting the expressions for ω_x and ω_y:\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ(2√(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ(√(k/m))\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term ħ√(k/m):\nE = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2) ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ√(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
