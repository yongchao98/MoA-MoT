    "Of the choices provided, Superstring Theory is the physical theory that is believed not to require regularization at high energies.\n\n*   **A) Superstring Theory:** A key feature of superstring theory is that it is believed to be free of ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences. Instead of point-particles, the fundamental objects are one-dimensional strings, and this extended nature smooths out the short-distance interactions that cause divergences in quantum field theories. Calculations in superstring theory have been shown to be finite without the need for regularization. While some contexts mention regularization for superstrings, it's often to handle infrared (low-energy) aspects or to construct proofs of the theory's inherent finiteness.\n\n*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory suffers from the problem of self-energy for point-like charged particles. The energy of the electric field of a point charge is infinite, which indicates a breakdown of the theory at very small distances (corresponding to high energies). This requires a form of regularization, such as assuming the charge is distributed over a small volume rather than being a true point.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** As a quantum field theory, QED calculations involving loop diagrams lead to infinite results (ultraviolet divergences) that must be managed. The procedure to handle these infinities is a two-step process starting with regularization, where a parameter is introduced to make the integrals finite, followed by renormalization.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** Similar to QED, QCD is a quantum field theory that describes the strong nuclear force. Calculations of interactions between quarks and gluons also produce ultraviolet divergences in loop diagrams. Therefore, QCD requires regularization and renormalization to yield physically meaningful predictions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
