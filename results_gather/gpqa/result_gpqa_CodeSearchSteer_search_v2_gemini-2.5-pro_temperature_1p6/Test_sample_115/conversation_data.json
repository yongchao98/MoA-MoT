    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound D:\n\n**1. Identification of Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of Compound A shows two signals: a triplet for 6 protons (6H) at 0.9 ppm and a quartet for 4 protons (4H) at 1.3 ppm.\n*   A 6H triplet suggests two identical methyl groups (-CH₃), each adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 for a triplet).\n*   A 4H quartet suggests two identical methylene groups (-CH₂-), each adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-), according to the n+1 rule (3+1=4 for a quartet).\n*   This pattern of two equivalent ethyl groups (CH₃-CH₂-) with chemical shifts in the alkane region (0.9 and 1.3 ppm) is characteristic of **n-butane** (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃). Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two methyl groups are equivalent, and the two methylene groups are equivalent.\n\n**2. Identification of Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. Radical bromination of an alkane is selective and favors the substitution of the most substituted carbon atom.\n*   In n-butane, the secondary carbons (C2 and C3) are more substituted than the primary carbons (C1 and C4).\n*   Therefore, the major product (Compound B) is **2-bromobutane**.\n\n**3. Identification of Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a classic E2 elimination reaction.\n*   The elimination of HBr from 2-bromobutane can form two different alkenes: but-1-ene and but-2-ene.\n*   According to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene is the major product. But-2-ene is a disubstituted alkene, while but-1-ene is monosubstituted.\n*   The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers, which confirms its identity as **but-2-ene**. But-2-ene exists as *cis*-but-2-ene ((Z)-but-2-ene) and *trans*-but-2-ene ((E)-but-2-ene).\n\n**4. Identification of Compound D**\n\n*   The reaction to form Compound D is a Diels-Alder reaction between the **cis-isomer of C** (*cis*-but-2-ene) and **(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol**.\n    *   **Diene**: (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol\n    *   **Dienophile**: *cis*-but-2-ene\n\n*   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring. To determine the product's structure and stereochemistry, we apply the rules of the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n    *   **Product Connectivity**: The reaction forms a cyclohexene ring substituted with one hydroxyl (-OH) group and three methyl (-CH₃) groups. Based on IUPAC numbering that gives the hydroxyl group priority (C1) and the double bond the lowest possible number (C2-C3), the product is **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol**. This matches the chemical name framework of options B and C.\n\n    *   **Stereochemistry**:\n        1.  **Dienophile Stereochemistry**: The stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained. Since *cis*-but-2-ene is used, the two methyl groups it provides (at positions C5 and C6 of the product) must be *cis* to each other.\n        2.  **Diene Stereochemistry**: The stereochemistry of the diene is also retained. For the diene to react, it must adopt an s-cis conformation. In the s-cis conformation of (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol, the substituents at the ends (C1-OH and C4-CH₃) are both oriented \"outward,\" which means they will be *cis* to each other in the final product.\n        3.  **Endo/Exo Selectivity**: The Alder Endo Rule generally predicts the major product. However, analyzing the stereochemical outcomes is complex. A more direct way is to analyze the stereochemistry given in the options.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Options**:\n    *   Options A and D can be eliminated because they have the incorrect substitution pattern (4,6,6-trimethyl instead of 4,5,6-trimethyl).\n    *   Let's analyze the relative stereochemistry of the methyl groups at C5 and C6 for options B and C, which must be *cis* as they come from *cis*-but-2-ene.\n        *   **Option B: (1S,4R,5S,6R)** - A (5S, 6R) configuration on this ring system corresponds to a *trans* relationship between the two methyl groups. This contradicts the use of a *cis*-dienophile. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n        *   **Option C: (1S,4R,5S,6S)** - A (5S, 6S) configuration corresponds to a *cis* relationship between the two methyl groups. This is consistent with the use of a *cis*-dienophile.\n\nAlthough a detailed analysis reveals that the (1S, 4R) relationship in option C is inconsistent with the use of a (1E,3E)-diene (which should give a 1S, 4S relationship), it is the only option that correctly represents the *cis* addition of the dienophile's substituents, a fundamental rule of this reaction. This suggests there is likely an error in the question's premise, but C remains the most plausible answer among the choices.\n\nTherefore, Compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
