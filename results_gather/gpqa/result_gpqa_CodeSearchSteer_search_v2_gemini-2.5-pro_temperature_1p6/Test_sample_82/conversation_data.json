    "### Calculation of pH at Different Titration Points\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point for the titration of diluted acetic acid with sodium hydroxide.\n\n**1. Initial Concentration of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, the initial 0.05 M acetic acid solution is diluted.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid:** 0.05 mol/L * 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **New total volume:** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   **Concentration of diluted acetic acid:** 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate. This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **pKa calculation:** The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for acetic acid is 1.85 x 10⁻⁵.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** This equation is used to calculate the pH of a buffer solution.\n    pH = pKa + log (\\[conjugate base] / \\[acid])\n*   At this point, the ratio of the conjugate base (acetate) to the acid (acetic acid) is 25% to 75%, or 1:3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.73 + log(0.25 / 0.75)\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.26\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion. For the titration of a weak acid with a strong base, the pH at the equivalence point is greater than 7.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH:** To reach the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH must equal the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    Volume of NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.0 cm³\n*   **Total Volume:** 40.0 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.0 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.0 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of Acetate:** The concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point is:\n    \\[CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion reacts with water, producing hydroxide ions and making the solution basic.\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Kb Calculation:** We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **OH⁻ Concentration:** We can find the hydroxide ion concentration using the Kb expression.\n    Kb = \\[[CH₃COOH][OH⁻]] / \\[[CH₃COO⁻]]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)\n    x² = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = \\[OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **pOH and pH Calculation:**\n    pOH = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nBased on these calculations, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n<<<D>>>"
