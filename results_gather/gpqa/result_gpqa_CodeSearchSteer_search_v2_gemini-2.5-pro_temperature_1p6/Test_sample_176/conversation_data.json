    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the fundamental principles of black-body radiation. The information regarding the mass and radial velocity of the stars is not necessary for this specific calculation.\n\n1.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law states that the wavelength at which a black body is brightest (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its surface temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. Since the problem states that the peak wavelengths for both stars are the same (λ_max1 = λ_max2), their surface temperatures must also be equal (T1 = T2).\n\n2.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The total power radiated by a star, its luminosity (L), is determined by its surface area and its temperature. The law is given by the equation L = σAT⁴, where A is the surface area, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since stars are spheres, their surface area is A = 4πR², where R is the radius.\n\nCombining these, the luminosity of a star is L = 4πR²σT⁴.\n\nNow, we can compute the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, and σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   As determined from Wien's Law, because their peak wavelengths are identical, their temperatures are the same, so T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<B>>>"
