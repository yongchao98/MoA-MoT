    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, each option must be evaluated.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is, by definition, a planet with the same characteristics as Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as about 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** For a planet with the same composition as Earth, having less mass results in weaker gravitational force. This leads to less compression of its material compared to Earth, and therefore a lower overall density. Its density would be less than 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** A planet with the same building blocks as Earth but significantly more mass will experience much stronger internal gravity. This increased gravitational force compresses the materials of the planet more tightly, leading to a higher overall density. Models of super-Earths show that for a planet with an Earth-like composition, the density increases with mass. Therefore, this planet's density will be greater than Earth's density of 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   Planet (a): ~5.51 g/cm³\n*   Planet (b): ~5.50 g/cm³\n*   Planet (c): > 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Planet (d): < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nThe planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass will be the densest due to gravitational compression.\n\n<<<D>>>"
