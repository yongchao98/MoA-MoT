    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can use the principles of stellar radial velocity and planetary energy balance.\n\n### Key Formulas:\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a given star, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).\n    *   `T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)`\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets around the same star is:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n2.  **Stellar Radial Velocity (RV) Amplitude (K):** The periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as the planets orbit it. The amplitude of this velocity (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its semi-major axis (a). The detection by both transit and RV methods implies the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so we can neglect the inclination angle.\n    *   `K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)`\n    *   From this, we can solve for the semi-major axis: `a ∝ (M_p / K)²`\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n\n1.  **Relate Temperature Ratio to Orbital Distance:**\n    The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends on the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance Ratio to Planet Mass and RV Amplitude:**\n    We can express the ratio of the semi-major axes (`a2 / a1`) using the relationship derived from the radial velocity amplitude:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / K2)² / (M_p1 / K1)² = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²`\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    By substituting the expression for `a2 / a1` into the temperature ratio equation, we get:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)² )`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   Mass of Planet1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n    *   Mass of Planet2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n    *   The radial velocity amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ).\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ_1) = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ_2) = 0.04 Å\n\n    Now, we calculate the ratios:\n    *   `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n    *   `K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\nThe extra information provided, such as the star's mass, radius, temperature, and the planets' radii, is not needed for calculating the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, as these terms cancel out in the final equation.\n\nThe correct ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
