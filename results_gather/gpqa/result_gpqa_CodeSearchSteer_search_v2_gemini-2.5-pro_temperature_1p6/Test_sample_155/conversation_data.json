    "The analysis of the chemical reactions and chromatographic separations is as follows:\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → Product 1**\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is treated with mCPBA. This is a syn-addition, which forms a trans-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, a racemic mixture of the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) epoxides is produced.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid. This is an anti-addition process where a water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the opposite side.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation. *Anti*-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene results in a single, achiral meso compound. In this case, the product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → Product 2**\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) reacts with mCPBA (syn-addition) to form a cis-epoxide, which is a meso compound.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The subsequent acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is an *anti*-addition.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. In this case, the products are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Combined Product Mixture**\nThe final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n*   One meso compound from Reaction 1.\n*   A pair of enantiomers from Reaction 2.\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of each of the enantiomers.\n\n**Chromatographic Analysis**\n1.  **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This method separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore will not be separated. They will elute as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated on a standard, achiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. This results in **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase to separate enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing the racemic mixture to be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, will also have a different interaction with the column and will elute as a distinct, third peak.\n    *   Therefore, all three stereoisomers will be separated. This results in **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
