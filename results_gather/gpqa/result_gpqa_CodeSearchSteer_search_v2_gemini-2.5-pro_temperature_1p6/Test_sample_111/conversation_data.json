    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector\n\nThe given state is `|alpha> ∝ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`.\nTo normalize it, we need to find the normalization constant C such that `|alpha> = C * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]` and `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\n\nThe inner product `<alpha|alpha>` is:\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [<(1-i)up| + <(2+i)down|] * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\nSince `|up>` and `|down>` are orthonormal (`<up|up>=1`, `<down|down>=1`, `<up|down>=0`, `<down|up>=0`), the calculation simplifies to:\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [ (1² - i²) + (2² - i²) ]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [ (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) ]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [ 2 + 5 ] = 7|C|^2`\n\nFor normalization, we set `<alpha|alpha> = 1`:\n`7|C|^2 = 1 => |C|^2 = 1/7 => C = 1/sqrt(7)`\n\nSo, the normalized state vector is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn matrix notation, with `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator and Find its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator `A` has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` for `i != j` and `Aij = 0` for `i = j`. In the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, this gives the matrix:\n`A = [ 0, hbar/2; hbar/2, 0 ] = (hbar/2) * [ 0, 1; 1, 0 ] = (hbar/2) * σ_x`\nwhere `σ_x` is the Pauli-X matrix.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det( [-λ, hbar/2; hbar/2, -λ] ) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues: `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding eigenvectors:\n*   For `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0 => [ -hbar/2, hbar/2; hbar/2, -hbar/2 ] * [a, b]^T = 0`\n    This leads to the equation `-a + b = 0`, so `a = b`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n*   For `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0 => [ hbar/2, hbar/2; hbar/2, hbar/2 ] * [a, b]^T = 0`\n    This leads to the equation `a + b = 0`, so `a = -b`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability `P(λ_i)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ_i` is given by `P(λ_i) = |<v_i|alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   **Probability for λ₁ = +hbar/2 (P₁):**\n    `<v₁|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    `P₁ = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability for λ₂ = -hbar/2 (P₂):**\n    `<v₂|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] = (1/sqrt(14)) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**.\n\n### 4. Find the Average Value\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `<A>` of the operator `A` can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    `<A> = Σ P_i * λ_i = P₁*λ₁ + P₂*λ₂`\n    `<A> = (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = **hbar/7**`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the definition `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`**\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [0, 1; 1, 0] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i), (2-i)]^T`\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [ (2-i), (1+i) ]^T`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1-i), (2+i) ] * (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [ (2-i), (1+i) ]^T`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - i - 2i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ] = (hbar/14) * 2 = **hbar/7**`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is hbar/7. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
