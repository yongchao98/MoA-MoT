    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactants\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data provided for the anhydride perfectly matches that of **maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃)**.\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at ~7 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent vinyl protons.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at ~137 ppm (alkene carbons) and ~165 ppm (carbonyl carbons) correspond to the two pairs of equivalent carbons in the symmetrical molecule.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄)**.\n\n### 2. The Reaction: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition\n\nThe reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a Diels-Alder reaction. This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic adduct. The stated molecular formula of the products, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms this, as C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃.\n\n### 3. Stereochemistry: *Endo* vs. *Exo* Products\n\nA Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: *endo* and *exo*.\n\n*   The **Alder Endo Rule** predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major product under kinetic control due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n*   However, significant steric hindrance can reverse this preference. In this reaction, the four methyl groups on the diene, particularly the ones at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead positions), create substantial steric clash with the anhydride ring in the *endo* transition state.\n*   Therefore, the reaction favors the less sterically hindered pathway, making the ***exo* adduct the major product** and the *endo* adduct the minor product. This is a known exception to the general *endo* rule.\n\n### 4. Structure and NOESY Spectra Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the spatial relationships of the protons in both isomers to predict the NOESY cross-peaks. The key protons in the product are:\n*   **Vinylic methyls (Me_vinyl):** The two methyl groups on the double bond (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet).\n*   **Anhydride protons (H_anhydride):** The two protons from the maleic anhydride part (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet).\n*   **Bridgehead methyls (Me_bridgehead):** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (~1.0 ppm, 6H singlet).\n*   **Methylene bridge protons (H_bridge):** The two protons on the C7 bridge.\n\n**NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We are looking for a cross-peak present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*).\n\n*   **In the *exo* isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond. This brings the **H_anhydride** protons close to the **Me_vinyl** groups. A NOESY cross-peak between these two sets of protons is expected.\n*   **In the *endo* isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the double bond, pointing \"under\" the bicyclic system. The H_anhydride protons are far from the Me_vinyl groups. Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.\n\nThis matches the problem's description: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\"\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe distinguishing cross-peak in the major (*exo*) product connects the **H_anhydride** protons with the **Me_vinyl** protons. Based on the typical chemical shifts:\n\n*   The **H_anhydride** protons appear as a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   The **Me_vinyl** protons appear as a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the spectrum of the major product connects the resonance at ~1.7 ppm (6H) and the resonance at ~3.5 ppm (2H). This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
