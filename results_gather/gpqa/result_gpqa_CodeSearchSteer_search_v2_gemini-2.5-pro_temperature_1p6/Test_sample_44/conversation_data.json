    "To solve this problem, we must first understand the behavior of spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n*   **Particle in a 1D Infinite Potential Well:** The energy levels for a single particle are quantized and given by the formula:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\n    where *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), *ħ* is the reduced Planck's constant, *m* is the particle's mass, and *L* is the length of the well.\n    The problem simplifies this by defining `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`, so the energy levels become `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\n*   **Spin-1/2 Particles:** These particles are fermions. This is crucial because identical fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level (*n*) and the spin projection (*m_s*), which can be spin-up (+1/2) or spin-down (-1/2). Consequently, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### Energy Calculations\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation for the energies of the required states:\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nFirst, let's list the energies of the first few single-particle states in terms of *E*:\n*   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n*   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n*   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n*   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n\n**2. Ground State Energy**\nTo find the ground state energy of the four-particle system, we must fill the lowest available energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   Two particles fill the `n=1` level (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is `2 * E_1 = 2 * 1E = 2E`.\n*   The remaining two particles fill the `n=2` level (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is `2 * E_2 = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum:\n`E_ground = 2*E_1 + 2*E_2 = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n**3. First Excited State Energy**\nTo get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state configuration to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   The ground state configuration has particles in `n=1` and `n=2`.\n*   We move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n\nThe total energy for the first excited state is:\n`E_1st_excited = 2*E_1 + 1*E_2 + 1*E_3 = 2(1E) + 1(4E) + 1(9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**4. Second Excited State Energy**\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next lowest possible energy configuration above the first excited state. We can achieve this by considering different promotions from the ground state:\n*   **Promotion 1:** Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 in `n=2`, 1 in `n=4`. Energy = `2(1E) + 1(4E) + 1(16E) = 22E`.\n*   **Promotion 2:** Promote a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. Configuration: 1 particle in `n=1`, 2 in `n=2`, 1 in `n=3`. Energy = `1(1E) + 2(4E) + 1(9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Promotion 3:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 2 in `n=3`. Energy = `2(1E) + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n\nComparing these possibilities, the lowest energy after the first excited state is 18E.\n\nThe total energy for the second excited state is:\n`E_2nd_excited = 18E`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the three states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
