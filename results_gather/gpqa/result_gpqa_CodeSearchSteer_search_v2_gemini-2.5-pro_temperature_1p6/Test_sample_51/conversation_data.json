    "The problem requires calculating the change in the population ratio of two atomic energy levels due to a change in temperature. This can be solved using the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium.\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nFor a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels, level 1 (with energy E₁) and level 2 (with energy E₂), is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\nN₁ / N₂ = (g₁ / g₂) * exp[-(E₁ - E₂) / (kT)]\n\nwhere:\n*   `g₁` and `g₂` are the statistical weights of the levels (which are constant for the atom).\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K).\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Interpreting the Observation**\n\nThe problem states that the ratio `N₁/N₂` decreases when the star has spots, which means the temperature is lower (5500 K compared to 6000 K). For the ratio `exp[-(E₁ - E₂) / kT]` to decrease as T decreases, the exponent `-(E₁ - E₂) / kT` must become more negative. Since `1/T` increases as `T` decreases, the term `-(E₁ - E₂)` must be negative. This implies that `E₁ - E₂` must be positive, meaning `E₁ > E₂`. Therefore, level 1 is the higher energy level.\n\n**3. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy difference between the two levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength. The energy `ΔE` can be calculated using the formula `ΔE = hc/λ`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   Wavelength `λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm`.\n*   A useful constant for this calculation is `hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm`.\n*   `ΔE = E₁ - E₂ = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV`.\n\n**4. Calculating the Factor of Change**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio of the unspotted state to the spotted state. Let `T_u = 6000 K` (unspotted) and `T_s = 5500 K` (spotted).\n\n`Factor = (N₁/N₂)unspotted / (N₁/N₂)spotted`\n\n`Factor = { (g₁/g₂) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_u)] } / { (g₁/g₂) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_s)] }`\n\nThe statistical weights `g₁/g₂` cancel out:\n\n`Factor = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_u)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_s)]`\n\n`Factor = exp[ -ΔE/k * (1/T_u - 1/T_s) ] = exp[ ΔE/k * (1/T_s - 1/T_u) ]`\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n\n*   `ΔE = 8.5635 eV`\n*   `k = 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K`\n*   `T_s = 5500 K`\n*   `T_u = 6000 K`\n\nFirst, calculate `ΔE/k`:\n`ΔE/k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K`\n\nNext, calculate the difference in the inverse of the temperatures:\n`1/T_s - 1/T_u = 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (12 - 11) / 66000 = 1 / 66000 K⁻¹`\n\nFinally, compute the exponent and the factor:\n`Exponent = (ΔE/k) * (1/T_s - 1/T_u) ≈ 99379 / 66000 ≈ 1.5057`\n\n`Factor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507`\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 4.5. The additional information about the star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage is not required for this calculation, as the effective temperatures for both the spotted and unspotted states are provided directly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
