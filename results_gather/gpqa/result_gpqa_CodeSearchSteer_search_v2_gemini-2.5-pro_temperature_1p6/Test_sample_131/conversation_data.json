    "To determine the two compounds in the mixture, we need to analyze the expected 1H NMR spectra for each of the options and see which combination matches the provided spectral data.\n\nAll compounds listed have the molecular formula C10H14. The experimental spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 integration ratio around 6.7 ppm.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 integration ratio around 2.2 ppm.\n\nLet's break down the expected spectrum for each compound:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** One singlet (12H).\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Two inequivalent protons, giving two separate singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Three sets of inequivalent methyl groups: one set of two equivalent methyls (6H) and two other distinct methyls (3H each). This results in three singlets with a 6:3:3 (or 2:1:1) integration ratio.\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** The two protons are equivalent, leading to one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups (the outer pair and the inner pair). This gives two singlets, each integrating to 6H, for a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** The aromatic protons are all equivalent. The ethyl groups would not produce singlets.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** A quartet (CH2) and a triplet (CH3), not singlets. This option can be immediately ruled out.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the mixtures:\n\n*   **A) 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (2H) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in **two singlets of equal integration (1:1 ratio)**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (12H) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum would show three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n\n*   **B) 1:1 mixture of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not show only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **C) 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This mixture would show three singlets (one 2H signal from 1,2,4,5- and two 1H signals from 1,2,3,5-) in a 2:1:1 ratio, which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1:1 mixture of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This mixture would also result in three singlets (one 2H signal from 1,2,3,4- and two 1H signals from 1,2,3,5-) in a 2:1:1 ratio, contradicting the data.\n\nThe only combination that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR spectrum is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
