    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for a binary fluoride is YFₙ.\n    The formula relating atomic weights (Ar), number of atoms (n), and mass fraction is:\n    ɷF = (n × Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n × Ar(F))\n    Using Ar(F) ≈ 19 g/mol, we can rearrange to solve for Ar(Y):\n    Ar(Y) ≈ ( (1 / ɷF) - 1 ) × n × 19\n    Ar(Y) ≈ ( (1 / 0.3196) - 1 ) × 19n ≈ 40.45n\n\n    We can test integer values for 'n':\n    *   If n=2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Selenium (Se, 79.0) or Bromine (Br, 79.9).\n    *   If n=3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76).\n    *   If n=6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is close to Plutonium (Pu, 244).\n\n    Let's check these candidates:\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** The calculated mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is 31.88%, which is an excellent match for the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu):** The mass percentage for PuF₆ is 31.84%, also an excellent match. However, if A2 is PuF₆, A1, which decomposes into A2 and fluorine, would have to be a higher fluoride like PuF₇ or PuF₈, which are not known to exist. This rules out Plutonium.\n    *   The strong match in mass percentage points firmly to **Y = Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 = SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Other Fluorides based on Antimony (Y=Sb).**\n    *   **A2 = SbF₃**: As determined above. Its molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol. It is a white solid.\n    *   **A3**: This compound is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) with fluorine and can also interact with xenon. This perfectly describes Antimony pentafluoride, **A3 = SbF₅**. SbF₅ is a strong Lewis acid known to react with xenon fluorides, and it is synthesized by direct fluorination of antimony. Its molecular weight is 216.75 g/mol.\n    *   **A1**: This is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine, and it oxidizes xenon. This is the most difficult clue, as the common fluorides of antimony are not red. This may refer to an obscure or impure compound, but it does not prevent identification of the others. Another very strong oxidizing agent with a red color is Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆). Silver(III) fluoride (AgF₃) is also bright red and unstable. However, the mass percentages for Pt and Ag do not match the key data for A2.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and A5.**\n    The problem states: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    The five known binary compounds of platinum fit the described chemical reactions very well, which suggests a possible error in the fluorine percentage provided for A2. Let's analyze the possibility of Y being Platinum.\n    *   **Hypothesis: Y = Platinum (Pt).**\n    *   **A1 = PtF₆**: A dark-red solid and one of the strongest oxidants, famous for oxidizing xenon. It decomposes upon heating to PtF₄ and F₂. This fits the description of A1 and its decomposition.\n    *   **A2 = PtF₄**: The product of A1's decomposition. Its molecular weight is ~271.08 g/mol. The mass percentage of fluorine is ~28.0%, which does not match the 31.96% given in the problem. This is a significant discrepancy.\n    *   **Five binary fluorides**: Platinum is known to form at least five: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆.\n    *   **A4**: Let's check the molecular weights of platinum fluorides against the given ranges. The molecular weight of PtF₂ is ~233.08 g/mol. This value falls squarely within the range **B) 220-240**.\n    *   **The 1:1 reaction**: If A4 = PtF₂, the reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` becomes `Pt + PtF₂ -> A5`. This is a classic comproportionation reaction. With a 1:1 stoichiometry, the product would be `2 PtF`. Thus, A5 could be PtF. The existence of PtF is documented, making this reaction chemically plausible.\n    *   **A5 hydrolysis**: PtF, as a sub-halide, would be expected to decompose in water.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAlthough the mass percentage of fluorine for A2 strongly suggests Y is Antimony (Sb), the subsequent clues (the red color of A1, the 1:1 reaction, and the provided molecular weight ranges) create multiple contradictions.\n\nConversely, if we assume the mass percentage for A2 is a typo and consider **Y = Platinum (Pt)**, all the other clues align to form a coherent picture:\n*   A1 = PtF₆ (red, strong oxidizer, decomposes to A2 + F₂).\n*   A2 = PtF₄.\n*   The set of five known fluorides exists.\n*   A4 = PtF₂ (MW ~233 g/mol), which perfectly matches range B).\n*   The 1:1 reaction `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF` works, identifying A5 as PtF.\n*   A5 is unstable in water.\n\nGiven that A4=PtF₂ has a molecular weight of approximately 233 g/mol, it falls into the 220-240 g/mol range.\n\n<<<B>>>"
