    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product, we must first understand the reaction and deduce the structure of the product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula and degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   **Core structure:** A cyclohex-3-ene ring. This is a six-membered ring containing one double bond.\n    *   **Substituents:**\n        *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   A formyl group (-CHO), which is an aldehyde.\n        *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂), which contains a double bond.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** The carbon skeleton consists of the 6-carbon ring, 1 carbon from the formyl group, 2 carbons from the vinyl group, and 1 carbon from the carboxylic acid, totaling **C₁₀**. Counting the hydrogens gives the formula **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Starting Material:**\n    The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) tells us the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    We can calculate it from the structure:\n    *   1 ring = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=C bond in the vinyl group = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=O bond in the formyl group = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group = 1 IHD\n    *   **Total IHD of starting material = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5**\n\n    Alternatively, using the formula `IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1` (oxygen atoms don't affect the calculation):\n    `IHD = 10 - (12/2) + 0/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reagent used is **red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is an extremely powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds (double and triple bonds) to their corresponding alkanes.\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to alkanes (-CH₃).\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to alkanes (-CH₃).\n    *   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\n4.  **Predict the Product and Its Molecular Formula:**\n    The reaction will reduce all the unsaturation in the starting material, except for the ring structure itself.\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced.\n    *   The double bond in the vinyl group is reduced.\n    *   The carbonyl (C=O) of the formyl group is reduced.\n    *   The carbonyl (C=O) of the carboxylic acid group is reduced.\n    The final product will be a fully saturated, substituted cyclohexane. Since the carbon skeleton is not broken, the product will still have 10 carbon atoms (**C₁₀**). The product is a saturated cycloalkane, which has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. For C₁₀, the formula will be **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    We can calculate the IHD for the product (C₁₀H₂₀) using the formula:\n    `IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1`.\n\n    This IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane backbone. All the pi bonds (four of them) have been removed by the reduction, decreasing the IHD from 5 to 1.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
