    "The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common expression in organic chemistry labs. It refers to a situation where a chemist is unable to separate two or more compounds using a chromatography technique.\n\nIn techniques like Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography, separation is based on the differing polarities of the compounds in a mixture. These compounds are passed through a stationary phase (like silica or alumina) using a mobile phase (a solvent).\n\n*   **Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC):** This is often used to quickly check the progress of a reaction or the purity of a sample. Compounds appear as spots on a plate. If two compounds have very similar polarities, their spots will travel the same distance up the plate and appear \"on top of each other,\" meaning they have the same or very similar Rf (retardation factor) values. This makes it difficult to distinguish them.\n\n*   **Column Chromatography:** This technique is used to physically separate larger amounts of compounds from a mixture. The mixture is loaded onto a column packed with a stationary phase, and a solvent is used to move the compounds down the column at different rates. Compounds with similar polarities will move down the column at nearly the same speed, eluting from the column at the same time. This results in the fractions collected containing a mixture of the compounds rather than the desired pure substances.\n\nWhen a sample contains compounds with very similar polarities, achieving a good separation can be challenging. Therefore, the chemist's statement most directly refers to the difficulty in separation due to this property.\n\n<<<C>>>"
