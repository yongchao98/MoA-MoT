    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the uncertainty in their energies. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe relationship is given by:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also known as the natural linewidth).\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the quantum state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nWe can calculate the energy uncertainty for each state. A common approximation for this calculation is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\n**For the first state:**\n*   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**For the second state:**\n*   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference between the two levels (|E₂ - E₁|) must be significantly larger than the energy uncertainties of the individual states. Specifically, the energy separation should be greater than the broader of the two linewidths. The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\nTherefore, the energy difference must be greater than approximately 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Looking at the given options:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV (smaller than the required minimum)\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV (much smaller than the required minimum)\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV (smaller than the required minimum)\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV (significantly larger than the required minimum of ~10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nThe only option that provides a large enough energy difference to clearly distinguish the two levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
