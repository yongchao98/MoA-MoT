    "The problem asks for the expectation value of the spin component in the y-direction, denoted as `⟨S_y⟩`, for an electron in the spin state `χ = (3i, 4)`.\n\n### 1. Define the State and Operator\n\n*   The spin state is given by the ket vector:\n    `|χ⟩ = [3i, 4]`\n\n*   The corresponding bra vector `⟨χ|` is the conjugate transpose of `|χ⟩`:\n    `⟨χ| = [-3i, 4]`\n\n*   The spin operator in the y-direction `S_y` is given by `(ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y matrix:\n    `S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n### 2. The Formula for Expectation Value\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `Â` for a state `|ψ⟩` is calculated using the formula:\n`⟨Â⟩ = ⟨ψ|Â|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n\nFor this problem, the formula is:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ / ⟨χ|χ⟩`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Denominator `⟨χ|χ⟩`\n\nThe term `⟨χ|χ⟩` represents the inner product of the state with itself and is used for normalization.\n\n`⟨χ|χ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]`\n`⟨χ|χ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n`⟨χ|χ⟩ = -9i² + 16`\nSince `i² = -1`:\n`⟨χ|χ⟩ = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Numerator `⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩`\n\nFirst, let's apply the `S_y` operator to the ket `|χ⟩`:\n`S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]`\n`S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4)]`\n`S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, 3i²]`\n`S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]`\n\nNow, multiply this result by the bra `⟨χ|`:\n`⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]`\n`⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]`\n`⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]`\n`⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]`\n`⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-24]`\n`⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = -12ħ`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Expectation Value `⟨S_y⟩`\n\nFinally, divide the numerator by the denominator:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25`\n`⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ/25`\n\nThis result matches the one found in a solved example with the exact same initial spin state.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 25*hbar/2\nB) -12*hbar/25\nC) 12*hbar/25\nD) -25*hbar/2\n\nThe calculated value is -12ħ/25, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
