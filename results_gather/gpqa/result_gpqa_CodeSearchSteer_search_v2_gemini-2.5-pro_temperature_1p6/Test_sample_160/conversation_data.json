    "The relationship between the mean free paths λ1 and λ2 is determined by the fundamental differences in how gas molecules interact with each other versus how an electron interacts with a gas molecule.\n\n*   **λ1 (Gas-Gas Mean Free Path):** This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. This interaction is well-approximated by a \"hard-sphere\" collision, where the key factor is the physical size (kinetic diameter) of the molecules. The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density (n) of particles and their collision cross-section (σ): λ = 1/(nσ).\n\n*   **λ2 (Electron-Gas Mean Free Path):** This is the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule. Unlike the hard-sphere collision between neutral molecules, this interaction is governed by the long-range electromagnetic force. An electron, being a charged particle, can be significantly deflected by a gas molecule's electric field (composed of its electron cloud and nucleus) without getting physically close.\n\nThe area in which a particle can cause a collision or scattering event is called the collision cross-section (σ). For particles that interact through long-range forces like electromagnetism, the scattering cross-section is generally larger than their simple geometric size. Because the electron interacts with gas molecules via this long-range force, its effective collision cross-section (σ2) is significantly larger than the kinetic cross-section for two gas molecules colliding (σ1).\n\nSince the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section, and the number density 'n' of gas molecules is the same in both scenarios, the following relationship holds:\n\n*   Because σ2 > σ1, it follows that 1/σ2 < 1/σ1.\n*   Therefore, λ2 < λ1.\n\nThe electron is more likely to interact (scatter) with the residual gas molecules than the gas molecules are to interact with each other, resulting in a shorter mean free path for the electron.\n\n<<<D>>>"
