    "The physical phenomenon described is Larmor precession. A magnetic moment in a magnetic field experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the axis of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation for the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State (t=0):** The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the `S_z` operator, specifically the \"spin-up\" state, represented by the ket `|+z>`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (t>0):** The magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction. The Hamiltonian `H` of the system is given by the interaction energy between the magnetic moment `μ` and the magnetic field `B`:\n    `H = -μ · B`\n    Since `μ = γS` (where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator) and the new field is `B` in the y-direction, the Hamiltonian becomes:\n    `H = -γ(S_x B_x + S_y B_y + S_z B_z) = -γS_y B`\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. Starting from the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`, the state at a later time `t` is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iγBS_y t/ħ) |+z>`\n\n4.  **Expectation Value:** We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`, which is `γ<S_z(t)>`. The expectation value of `S_z` at time `t` is:\n    `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n    `<S_z(t)> = <+z| exp(-iγBS_y t/ħ) S_z exp(iγBS_y t/ħ) |+z>`\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The operator `exp(iγBS_y t/ħ)` represents a rotation of the spin states around the y-axis by an angle `θ = γBt`. The operator `S_z` is transformed into `S_z(t)`. The expectation value of `S_z` can be calculated, which yields:\n    `<S_z(t)> = <S_z(0)> * cos(γBt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency:** The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is therefore:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThis expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `cos(ωt)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency. By comparing this to our result, we can identify the angular frequency `ω`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency `ω` is `γB`. This is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n<<<C>>>"
