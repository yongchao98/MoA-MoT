    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the energy at which gamma-ray lifetimes are limited by pair production with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons.\n\n### The Physics of the Interaction\n\nThe process in question is electron-positron pair production, where two photons interact to create an electron ($e^-$) and a positron ($e^+$):\n\nγ (high-energy) + γ (CMB) → e⁻ + e⁺\n\nFor this reaction to occur, the total energy of the two photons in their center-of-mass frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron and positron combined.\n\n### Threshold Energy Calculation\n\n1.  **Fundamental Constants and Given Values**:\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron (mₑc²) is approximately 0.511 MeV. Since a positron has the same mass, the total rest mass energy required is 2 * mₑc² = 1.022 MeV.\n    *   The average energy of a CMB photon (E_cmb) is given as 10⁻³ eV.\n\n2.  **Kinematic Condition**:\n    To find the minimum energy (the threshold energy) for the high-energy gamma-ray (E_γ), we consider the most energetically favorable scenario, which is a head-on collision between the high-energy photon and the CMB photon.\n\n3.  **Lorentz Invariant Calculation**:\n    The threshold energy for this process can be derived from the principles of special relativity. The square of the total four-momentum must be conserved. For a head-on collision, the threshold energy E_γ for the incoming gamma-ray is given by the formula:\n\n    E_γ = (mₑc²)² / E_cmb\n\n4.  **Substituting the Values**:\n    *   mₑc² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10⁶ eV\n    *   E_cmb = 10⁻³ eV\n\n    E_γ = (0.511 x 10⁶ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)\n    E_γ = (0.2611 x 10¹² eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)\n    E_γ = 0.2611 x 10¹⁵ eV\n    E_γ = 2.611 x 10¹⁴ eV\n\n5.  **Converting to Giga-electronvolts (GeV)**:\n    Since 1 GeV = 10⁹ eV:\n\n    E_γ = (2.611 x 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)\n    E_γ = 2.611 x 10⁵ GeV\n\nThis calculated value is the minimum energy a gamma-ray must have to be able to interact with a typical CMB photon to create an electron-positron pair. Gamma rays with energies at or above this threshold will have their travel distance (and thus lifetime in the universe) significantly limited by this interaction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the calculated energy with the given options:\n\n*   A) 9.5 * 10⁴ GeV\n*   B) 1.8 * 10⁵ GeV\n*   C) 2.6 * 10⁵ GeV\n*   D) 3.9 * 10⁵ GeV\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 2.6 x 10⁵ GeV matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
