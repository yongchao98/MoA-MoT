    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n\n### Fundamental Definition\n\nThe elemental abundance notation `[X/Y]` for two elements X and Y in a star is defined relative to the Sun as:\n\n`[X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY)_star ) - log10( (nX/nY)_sun )`\n\nWhere `n` represents the number density of the atoms of a given element.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 1\n\nWe are given the following for Star 1:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex`\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex`\n\nThe silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]_1`, can be found by combining these two ratios. The relationship is:\n\n`[Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H]`\n\nPlugging in the values for Star 1:\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3 dex`\n\nThis means:\n`log10( (nSi/nH)_1 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun ) = 0.3`\n\nSo, the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen in Star 1 is:\n`(nSi/nH)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun`\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 2\n\nWe are given the following for Star 2:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex`\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex`\n\nTo find `[Si/H]_2`, we first need to find the `[Si/Mg]_2` ratio. This is the inverse of the given `[Mg/Si]_2` ratio:\n\n`[Si/Mg]_2 = -[Mg/Si]_2 = -0.3 dex`\n\nNow, we can find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]_2`, using a similar relationship as in Step 1:\n\n`[Si/H] = [Si/Mg] + [Mg/H]`\n\nPlugging in the values for Star 2:\n`[Si/H]_2 = -0.3 + 0 = -0.3 dex`\n\nThis means:\n`log10( (nSi/nH)_2 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun ) = -0.3`\n\nSo, the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen in Star 2 is:\n`(nSi/nH)_2 = 10^-0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Atoms\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. This is the ratio of their silicon number densities, which we can approximate as the ratio of their abundances relative to hydrogen.\n\n`Ratio = nSi_1 / nSi_2 ≈ (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`\n\nNow substitute the expressions found in the previous steps:\n\n`Ratio = ( 10^0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun ) / ( 10^-0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun )`\n\nThe solar abundance term `(nSi/nH)_sun` cancels out:\n\n`Ratio = 10^0.3 / 10^-0.3`\n\nUsing the rules of exponents (`a^m / a^n = a^(m-n)`):\n\n`Ratio = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^(0.3 + 0.3) = 10^0.6`\n\nCalculating the final value:\n\n`Ratio ≈ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately **3.9**.\n\nNote that the masses of the stars and the specific solar abundance values for iron and magnesium are not required for calculating the final ratio.\n\n<<<C>>>"
