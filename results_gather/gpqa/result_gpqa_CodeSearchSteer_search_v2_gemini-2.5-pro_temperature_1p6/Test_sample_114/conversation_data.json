    "The collision of an electron and a positron resulting in their annihilation and the creation of photons is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. This problem requires a relativistic treatment due to the high speeds of the particles, indicated by their Lorentz factors.\n\n### Analysis of the Collision\n\n**1. Initial State: Energy and Momentum**\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle with rest mass (m) and Lorentz factor (γ) is given by E = γmc². The momentum (p) is given by p = γβmc, where β is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light (c). The Lorentz factor and β are related by β = √(1 - 1/γ²).\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_e) = 4\n    *   Velocity factor (β_e) = √(1 - 1/4²) = √(15/16) = √15 / 4\n    *   Moving from the left (positive x-direction)\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_p) = 2\n    *   Velocity factor (β_p) = √(1 - 1/2²) = √(3/4) = √3 / 2\n    *   Moving from the right (negative x-direction)\n\nLet m_e be the rest mass of both the electron and the positron.\n\n**Total Initial Energy (E_i):**\nE_i = E_electron + E_positron\nE_i = (γ_e * m_e * c²) + (γ_p * m_e * c²)\nE_i = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²\n\n**Total Initial Momentum (p_i):**\nThe momentum is a vector. Since the collision is along the horizontal (x-axis), the initial momentum is entirely in the x-direction.\np_ix = p_electron_x + p_positron_x\np_ix = (γ_e * β_e * m_e * c) + (γ_p * (-β_p) * m_e * c)\np_ix = (4 * (√15 / 4) * m_e * c) - (2 * (√3 / 2) * m_e * c)\np_ix = (√15 - √3) * m_e * c\n\n**2. Final State: Two Photons**\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced.\n\n*   The photons have equal energy (E_ph).\n*   One moves in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right. This implies that if one has a vertical momentum component `p_y`, the other has `-p_y`, conserving the initial zero vertical momentum.\n\n**Total Final Energy (E_f):**\nE_f = E_ph1 + E_ph2 = 2 * E_ph\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\nE_i = E_f\n6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_ph\n**E_ph = 3 * m_e * c²** (Energy of each photon)\n\n**Total Final Momentum (p_f):**\nFor a photon, the magnitude of its momentum is E/c.\n|p_ph| = E_ph / c = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c\n\nLet θ be the angle of the upper-right photon with the horizontal axis, and -θ be the angle for the lower-right photon.\n\np_fx = |p_ph|cos(θ) + |p_ph|cos(-θ) = 2 * |p_ph|cos(θ)\np_fy = |p_ph|sin(θ) + |p_ph|sin(-θ) = 0 (as expected)\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**\np_ix = p_fx\n(√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 2 * |p_ph| * cos(θ)\n\nSubstitute the value for |p_ph|:\n(√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ)\n(√15 - √3) = 6 * cos(θ)\ncos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\n**3. Calculating the Angle**\n\nNow we calculate the value of θ:\ncos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\nθ ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\nAngle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
