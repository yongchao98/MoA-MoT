    "This problem involves the annihilation of a proton and a slowly moving antiproton, resulting in the creation of four new particles. To determine the velocity of the resulting particles, we apply the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n### Energy Conservation\nThe process begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) and ends with two A$^{+}$ particles and two A$^{-}$ particles. The reaction is:\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nSince the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" its kinetic energy can be considered negligible. Assuming the proton is at rest, the total initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_i$)**: This is the combined rest energy of the proton and antiproton.\n    $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_i = 2 \\times 938.272 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.544 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe final state consists of four particles of mass $m_A$, with a given rest energy $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the four resulting particles will have the same speed, *v*.\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_f$)**: This is the sum of the total relativistic energies of the four A particles.\n    $E_f = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n    where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is given by $1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$.\n    $E_f = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### Calculation\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the initial energy must equal the final energy ($E_i = E_f$):\n$1876.544 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\nFirst, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.544}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNow, we can find the velocity *v* from the Lorentz factor. The relationship between $\\gamma$ and velocity (expressed as $\\beta = v/c$) is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of each particle A is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>"
