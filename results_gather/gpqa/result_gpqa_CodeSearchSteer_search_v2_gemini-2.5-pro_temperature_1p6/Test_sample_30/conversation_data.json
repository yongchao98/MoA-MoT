    "Here is the step-by-step determination of the final product and its symmetry:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Nitration of Toluene**\n    Toluene, when treated with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-directing activator. The major product, due to less steric hindrance, is para-nitrotoluene (p-nitrotoluene).\n    *   **Product 1: p-Nitrotoluene**\n\n2.  **Step 2: Oxidation of Product 1**\n    Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This combination is an oxidizing agent. While strong oxidation can convert the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, a plausible and common reaction is the oxidation of the benzylic methyl group to an aldehyde. This is particularly relevant given the reagents in the next step.\n    *   **Product 2: p-Nitrobenzaldehyde**\n\n3.  **Step 3: Aldol Condensation**\n    Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone (CH₃COCH₃) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a classic base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation known as the **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**. p-Nitrobenzaldehyde has no α-hydrogens and can only act as the electrophile. Acetone has α-hydrogens and, in the presence of the base (NaOH), forms an enolate which acts as the nucleophile. The initial adduct dehydrates readily to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The reaction produces (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    *   **Product 3: (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\nThe structure of Product 3 is O₂N−C₆H₄−CH=CH−C(=O)CH₃. Due to the extensive system of pi-bonds, the molecule is largely planar. To determine its point group, we look for symmetry elements:\n\n*   **Rotational Axes (Cₙ):** There are no C₂, C₃, or higher-order rotational axes. Rotating the molecule around any axis by 180° or 120° does not result in an identical configuration.\n*   **Mirror Plane (σ):** Assuming the molecule is planar, the plane containing all the atoms is a mirror plane (σ).\n*   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not possess a center of inversion. For example, there is a nitro group on one side of the ring and no corresponding group on the opposite side.\n*   **Improper Rotation (Sₙ):** There are no improper rotation axes.\n\nSince the only symmetry elements are the identity element (E) and a single mirror plane (σ), the molecular symmetry group (point group) is **Cₛ**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
