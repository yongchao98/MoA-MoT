    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### Fundamental Concepts\n\nUnstable particles decay over time, but for particles moving at relativistic speeds, this time is extended in the observer's frame of reference (the detector). This phenomenon is known as time dilation.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive after a certain time `t` in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n`N/N₀ = e^(-t / τ_lab)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `N` is the number of particles that reach the detector.\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `t` is the time it takes to travel to the detector wall in the lab frame.\n*   `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame.\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is dilated from the particle's proper lifetime (`τ₀`, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n`τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n\nThe time `t` for a particle traveling at an ultra-relativistic velocity (`v ≈ c`, where `c` is the speed of light) to reach the detector wall of radius `R` is:\n`t ≈ R / c`\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation gives the survival probability as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n`N/N₀ = e^(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))`\n\n### Solving the Problem\n\nLet's analyze the two scenarios given in the problem.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁` = 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, `N₁/N₀` = 1/3\n*   Detector radius, `R` = 30 m\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n`1/3 = e^(-R / (c * 20 * τ₀))`\n\nTo simplify, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -R / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n`-ln(3) = -R / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n`ln(3) = R / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂` = ?\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, `N₂/N₀` = 2/3\n*   The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant because the detector radius, the speed of light, and the particle's proper lifetime do not change.\n\nPlugging the values for the second scenario into the equation:\n`2/3 = e^(-R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n`ln(2/3) = -R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n`ln(1.5) = R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n\n**Finding the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  `ln(3) = R / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n2.  `ln(1.5) = R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express the constant term `R / (c * τ₀)` as:\n`R / (c * τ₀) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nNow, substitute this into equation (2):\n`ln(1.5) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\nFinally, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
