    "The scenario described involves several key immunological events. An oral antigen (rotavirus protein) is delivered, which localizes to the Peyer's patches, a type of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). In these secondary lymphoid organs, a cell population proliferates in response to the antigen. Crucially, sequencing reveals high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of these cells.\n\nTo identify the process, let's analyze the options:\n\n*   **A) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process alters the constant region (C_H_) of the heavy chain, not the variable region. It switches the antibody's isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA) and thereby its effector function, but it does not change the antigen-binding specificity, which is determined by the variable region.\n*   **B) V(D)J recombination:** This is the mechanism that generates the initial diversity of antibody and T-cell receptors. It occurs in developing lymphocytes within primary lymphoid organs (like the bone marrow for B cells) *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment, however, is observing a process in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen stimulation.\n*   **C) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, a cascade of plasma proteins that helps to clear pathogens. It is not directly involved in the genetic modification of B cell receptor genes.\n*   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes in activated B cells. This process takes place within specialized microenvironments called germinal centers, which are found in secondary lymphoid organs like the Peyer's patches. The purpose of SHM is to generate B cell variants with potentially higher affinity for the activating antigen. The cells with the highest affinity are then selected to survive and proliferate, a process known as affinity maturation. This precisely matches the observation of a proliferating cell population in Peyer's patches exhibiting high variability in the variable heavy chain gene following antigen exposure.\n\nBased on this, the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating cells in the Peyer's patches after antigen challenge is a hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
