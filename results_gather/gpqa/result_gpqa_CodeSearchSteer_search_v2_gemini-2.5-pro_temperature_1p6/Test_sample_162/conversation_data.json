    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the resulting pH.\n\n### 1. Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we determine the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Atomic mass of Iron (Fe) ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃:\nMoles = mass / molar mass\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n\n### 2. Determine the volume of the strong acid\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ by a strong acid (represented by H⁺) proceeds according to the following reaction:\n**Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n\nMoles of H⁺ needed = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\nMoles of H⁺ needed = 3 * 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\nThe problem specifies a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, which means the concentration of H⁺ is 0.1 mol/L. We can now calculate the volume of this acid needed:\nVolume (L) = Moles of H⁺ / Concentration of H⁺\nVolume (L) = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L.\n\nTo convert the volume to cm³, we multiply by 1000:\nVolume (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis value closely matches the volume given in option D.\n\n### 3. Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n\nAfter dissolving the Fe(OH)₃, the total volume of the solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The Fe³⁺ ions produced will hydrolyze in water, which affects the pH.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentration of Fe³⁺ ions in the solution:\n[Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe³⁺ / Total Volume\n[Fe³⁺] = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction for the hydrated Fe³⁺ ion is:\n**[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)**\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction (Ka) is given by the first hydrolysis constant for Fe³⁺. According to literature, the value for log(β₁) is -2.19 at 25°C.\nKa = 10⁻²·¹⁹ ≈ 6.46 x 10⁻³\n\nNow we set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the H⁺ concentration at equilibrium:\n\n| | [Fe³⁺] | [Fe(OH)²⁺] | [H⁺] |\n| :--- | :---------- | :---------- | :---- |\n| **I**nitial | 0.009356 | 0 | 0 |\n| **C**hange | -x | +x | +x |\n| **E**quilibrium | 0.009356 - x | x | x |\n\nThe Ka expression is:\nKa = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = (x)(x) / (0.009356 - x) = 6.46 x 10⁻³\n\nThis gives a quadratic equation:\nx² = (6.46 x 10⁻³)(0.009356 - x)\nx² = 6.04 x 10⁻⁵ - 6.46 x 10⁻³x\nx² + 0.00646x - 0.0000604 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for x (where x represents [H⁺]):\nx ≈ 0.00519 M\n\nFinally, we calculate the pH:\npH = -log[H⁺]\npH = -log(0.00519) ≈ 2.29\n\nThis calculated pH of 2.29 is reasonably close to the value of 2.04 given in option D. The discrepancy can arise from a few factors:\n*   The use of a slightly different Ka value for Fe³⁺ hydrolysis from another source.\n*   The possibility that the question assumes some excess acid is needed to ensure complete dissolution, which would lower the pH further towards 2.04.\n\nHowever, based on the stoichiometric calculation, the volume of 28.07 cm³ is a very strong match for the value in option D (28.05 cm³). Combining this with a pH in the same acidic range, option D is the most plausible answer.\n\nFinal check of options:\nA) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nB) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nC) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\nD) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n\nOur calculated volume is ~28.07 cm³ and pH is ~2.29. Option D is the closest match for both values.\n\n<<<D>>>"
