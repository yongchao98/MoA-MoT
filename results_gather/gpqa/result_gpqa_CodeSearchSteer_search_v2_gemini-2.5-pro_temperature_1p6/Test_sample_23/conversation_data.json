    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the nature of substance Z.**\n    Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. The mass percentage of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon with the formula CxHy is given by `(y * 1) / (12x + y)`.\n    `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`\n    `0.1428 * (12x + y) = y`\n    `1.7136x + 0.1428y = y`\n    `1.7136x = 0.8572y`\n    `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`\n    The empirical formula of Z is CH2. Therefore, its molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Determine the carbon skeleton of all substances.**\n    Mixture X (composed of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2) upon hydrogenation gives only substance Z. This means both X1 and X2 hydrogenate to form Z.\n    Mixture Y (composed of two liquids, Y1 and Y2) upon hydrogenation also gives only substance Z.\n    For all these different compounds (X1, X2, Y1, Y2) to produce only a single product Z upon hydrogenation, they must all share the same carbon skeleton.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y and Substance Z.**\n    Mixture X undergoes disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst to form mixture Y. Disproportionation is a redox reaction where some molecules are oxidized (dehydrogenated) and others are reduced (hydrogenated).\n    Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components must be saturated (alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    The disproportionation of a cycloalkene or cyclodiene over platinum typically produces an aromatic compound (the oxidized product) and a cycloalkane (the reduced product).\n    Therefore, mixture Y consists of an aromatic hydrocarbon (Y1) and a cycloalkane (Y2). Both do not decolorize bromine water.\n    The problem states Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane, it must be the reduced product, so `Z = Y2`.\n    Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of the aromatic component Y1 must also yield Z.\n    This leads to two plausible scenarios:\n    *   **Scenario 1 (C6 system):** Y1 is benzene (C6H6) and Y2 is cyclohexane (C6H12). Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Z would be cyclohexane (C6H12), which is a widely used solvent.\n    *   **Scenario 2 (C7 system):** Y1 is toluene (C7H8) and Y2 is methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Hydrogenation of toluene gives methylcyclohexane. Z would be methylcyclohexane (C7H14), which is also a widely used solvent. Both fit the CnH2n formula and the 14.28% hydrogen mass.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X.**\n    Mixture X consists of two unsaturated liquids (X1, X2) that decolorize bromine water. They are the precursors to Y1 and Y2. The reaction `X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2` is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The total number of hydrogen and carbon atoms must be conserved.\n    *   **In Scenario 1 (C6 system):**\n        *   Y = Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12). Total atoms: C12H18.\n        *   Thus, X must be composed of C6 compounds that add up to C12H18. As it's an equimolar mixture of two precursors, they would be a cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and a cyclohexene (C6H10).\n        *   Reaction: `C6H8 + C6H10 → C6H6 + C6H12`. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n        *   Hydrogenation of C6H8 and C6H10 both produce cyclohexane (Z). This scenario is consistent.\n        *   Total hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n    *   **In Scenario 2 (C7 system):**\n        *   Y = Toluene (C7H8) + Methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Total atoms: C14H22.\n        *   Thus, X must be composed of C7 compounds that add up to C14H22. As it's an equimolar mixture, they would be a methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10) and a methylcyclohexene (C7H12).\n        *   Reaction: `C7H10 + C7H12 → C7H8 + C7H14`. This is also a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n        *   Hydrogenation of a methylcyclohexadiene and a methylcyclohexene both produce methylcyclohexane (Z). This scenario is also consistent.\n        *   Total hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X = 10 + 12 = 22.\n\n5.  **Choose between the two scenarios.**\n    Both scenarios are chemically sound and fit all given conditions. However, the problem asks for a single answer. There is a subtle clue in the description of the substances. Mixture Y is composed of \"two other liquids\" and Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". In the C6 scenario, one of the liquids in Y is benzene. While a solvent, its use is heavily restricted due to its high toxicity (it is a known carcinogen). In the C7 scenario, the liquids in Y are toluene and methylcyclohexane. Toluene is a very common industrial solvent that largely replaced benzene, and methylcyclohexane is also a common solvent. The C7 pair is a better fit for the description of common liquid solvents. This suggests the C7 scenario is the intended one.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    Based on the more plausible C7 scenario, mixture X consists of a methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10) and a methylcyclohexene (C7H12).\n    The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these two liquids is 10 + 12 = 22.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
