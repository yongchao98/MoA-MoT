    "The total electrostatic potential energy of an isolated system of charges is the sum of the potential energies for every pair of charges in the system. The system in question consists of 13 identical particles, each with a charge `q = 2e`. One particle is fixed at a point P, and the other 12 are constrained to a spherical surface of radius `r = 2` m, centered at P.\n\nTo find the minimum energy of the system, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual potential energy. This classic physics problem is known as the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the configuration of minimum energy is achieved when the particles are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe total energy `U` of the system is the sum of two components:\n1.  **U₁**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  **U₂**: The potential energy from the mutual interaction of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n**Calculation of U₁:**\nThe potential energy between the central charge `q` and each of the 12 charges `q` on the sphere at distance `r` is given by Coulomb's law. The total for all 12 is:\n`U₁ = 12 * (k * q² / r)`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is Coulomb's constant, approximately `8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²`.\n*   `q` is the charge of each particle, which is `2e`.\n*   `e` is the elementary charge, exactly `1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`.\n*   `r` is the distance, `2` m.\n\n**Calculation of U₂:**\n`U₂` is the sum of potential energies for all pairs of the 12 charges arranged in an icosahedron. This can be expressed as:\n`U₂ = L₁₂ * (k * q² / r)`\nwhere `L₁₂` is a dimensionless constant representing the potential energy of 12 charges on a unit sphere. For an icosahedral arrangement, the value of `L₁₂` can be calculated based on its geometry. The 66 pairs of vertices in an icosahedron have distances that fall into three groups relative to the circumradius `r`. The sum of the inverse distances gives:\n`L₁₂ = 15 * sqrt(5 + 2√5) + 3 ≈ 49.16525`\n\n**Total Energy Calculation:**\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum `U₁ + U₂`:\n`U_total = (12 * k * q² / r) + (L₁₂ * k * q² / r) = (12 + L₁₂) * (k * q² / r)`\n`U_total = (12 + 49.16525) * (k * (2e)² / r)`\n`U_total = 61.16525 * ( (8.98755 × 10⁹) * (2 * 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹)² / 2 )`\n`U_total ≈ 61.16525 * ( 4.61426 × 10⁻²⁸ J )`\n`U_total ≈ 2.82246 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the minimum energy is `2.822 × 10⁻²⁶ J`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
