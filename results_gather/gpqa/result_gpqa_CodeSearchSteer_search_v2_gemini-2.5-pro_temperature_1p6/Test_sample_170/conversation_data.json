    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring during an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\nThe six substances are:\n1)  **Toluene (C6H5-CH3):** The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.\n2)  **Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5):** The carbethoxy group (-COOC2H5) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n3)  **Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group.\n4)  **Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2):** The nitro group (-NO2) is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n5)  **Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.\n6)  **Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH):** The carboxy group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n### Analysis of Isomer Distribution:\n\n**Meta-Directing Groups (Substances 2, 4, 6):**\nThese substituents direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is consequently very low.\n*   **4. Nitrobenzene (-NO2):** This is one of the most strongly deactivating groups. During bromination, it yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer. Reports show the para-isomer yield is extremely low, around 1% or even less.\n*   **6. Benzoic acid (-COOH) and 2. Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5):** Both are deactivating, meta-directing groups. The para-isomer yield is low for both. For the related nitration of ethyl benzoate, the para yield is around 5%. For nitration of benzoic acid, the para yield is about 1.5%. While nitration and bromination are different, the relative order is generally preserved. The -COOH and -COOR groups are strongly deactivating. The bromination of benzoic acid yields about 22% p-bromobenzoic acid, with the majority being the m-isomer. This is higher than expected for a simple meta-director but still places it in the low-yield group. Data for ethyl benzoate bromination suggests it behaves similarly, with low para yield. Considering the deactivating strengths, the order of increasing para yield among these is expected to be nitrobenzene < benzoic acid < ethyl benzoate.\n\nTherefore, the first three substances in the sequence, with the lowest para yields, are 4, 6, and 2.\n\n**Ortho/Para-Directing Groups (Substances 1, 3, 5):**\nThese substituents direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para products depends on a balance of electronic and steric effects.\n*   **1. Toluene (-CH3):** The methyl group is small. For bromination, a typical product distribution is about 33-40% ortho-isomer and 60-67% para-isomer. Let's take the para yield as ~60%.\n*   **5. Ethylbenzene (-C2H5):** The ethyl group is larger than the methyl group. This increased steric bulk hinders the ortho positions more, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene. Thus, the para yield for ethylbenzene will be greater than for toluene.\n*   **3. Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** Halogens are deactivating but ortho/para-directing. The -Cl group is relatively small but highly electronegative. The para-isomer is strongly favored in the bromination of chlorobenzene, with yields reported around 87-89%.\n\nComparing these three, the para yield from toluene (~60%) is the lowest. The larger ethyl group in ethylbenzene increases steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para yield higher than for toluene. Chlorobenzene also gives a very high yield of the para product, often higher than simple alkylbenzenes. Comparing ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene is subtle, but typical data shows that halobenzenes like chlorobenzene give a very high para-to-ortho ratio. The para-isomer is the major product in the bromination of ethylbenzene due to steric hindrance, likely giving a higher para percentage than toluene but less than the highly selective chlorobenzene bromination.\n\n### Final Order:\nCombining these findings, we can arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Extremely low para yield (~1%).\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Low para yield (~22% on bromination).\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Low para yield, likely slightly higher than benzoic acid.\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Significant para yield (~60%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Higher para yield than toluene due to increased steric hindrance.\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Very high para yield (~87-89%).\n\nThe resulting order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
