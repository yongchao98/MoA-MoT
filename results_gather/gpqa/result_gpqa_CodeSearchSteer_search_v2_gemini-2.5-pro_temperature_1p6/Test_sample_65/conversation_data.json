    "In the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), not all symmetries are treated equally. SMEFT extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators, but it does so under a specific set of foundational assumptions.\n\nAll operators in SMEFT must respect **Lorentz symmetry** and the broader **Poincaré symmetry** (which includes translations in spacetime). These symmetries are fundamental principles upon which the theory is built. Any term in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be a scalar under Lorentz transformations to ensure the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers.\n\nFurthermore, due to the CPT theorem, any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must also be invariant under the combined action of Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant field theory, **CPT symmetry** must be respected by all its operators. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance, which is a foundational assumption of SMEFT.\n\nOn the other hand, **CP symmetry** is not a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT. The framework is explicitly designed to parameterize potential new sources of CP violation beyond what is already present in the Standard Model. Consequently, many operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be CP-violating.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
