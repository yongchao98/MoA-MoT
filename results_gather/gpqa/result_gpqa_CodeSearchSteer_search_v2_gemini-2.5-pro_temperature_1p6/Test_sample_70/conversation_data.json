    "The search results confirm my understanding of the physics involved.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a black body heated only by its star. It assumes a balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated by the planet. The formula shows that T_eq is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance from the star ('a').\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures for two planets (Planet_4 and Planet_2) is T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4). My initial formula is correct.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). The law can be expressed as P² ∝ a³.\n    *   This can be rearranged to a ∝ P^(2/3).\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3). This is also correct.\n\n3.  **Combined Calculation:** Combining the two relationships:\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4) = sqrt((P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3).\n\nNow I will re-do the calculation with these confirmed formulas.\n\n**Given Data:**\n*   Ratio of orbital periods (P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5) = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5\n\n**Required:**\n*   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq4 / T_eq2\n\n**Step 1: Find the ratio of the orbital periods P_2 / P_4.**\n*   From the given ratio, P_2 corresponds to the value 2 and P_4 corresponds to the value 3.5.\n*   P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the temperature ratio.**\n*   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n*   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n*   2 / 3.5 ≈ 0.57142857\n*   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (0.57142857)^(1/3)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the cube root.**\n*   (0.57142857)^(1/3) ≈ 0.82988\n*   Rounding to two decimal places gives 0.83.\n\nThis result matches option D. The initial reasoning and calculation were correct. The search results provide a solid confirmation of the underlying principles. No new searches are needed.\n\nFinal check of the question:\n- Ratio of T_eq between Planet_4 and Planet_2. This means I need T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n- My formula gives: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3). This is correct as T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a) and a is proportional to P^(2/3), so T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(P^(2/3)) which simplifies to P^(-1/3).\n- So T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_4)^(-1/3) / (P_2)^(-1/3) = (P_4 / P_2)^(-1/3) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3). The logic holds.\n- The calculation is correct.\n- The answer matches one of the options.\n\nThe problem states the planets have circular orbits, which means the semi-major axis 'a' is simply the orbital radius. Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit (P² ∝ a³). The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet, assuming it radiates as a black body and has the same albedo as the other planets in the system, is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance (semi-major axis 'a') from the star (T_eq ∝ 1/√a).\n\nWe can derive the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period:\n1.  From Kepler's Third Law, a ∝ P^(2/3).\n2.  Substitute this into the temperature relation: T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3)).\n3.  This simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) or T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3).\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2), we can use the ratio of their orbital periods (P_4 and P_2):\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_4 / P_2)^(-1/3) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\nFrom the problem statement, the ratio of orbital periods is P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n*   P_2 corresponds to a ratio value of 2.\n*   P_4 corresponds to a ratio value of 3.5.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.83\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n<<<D>>>"
