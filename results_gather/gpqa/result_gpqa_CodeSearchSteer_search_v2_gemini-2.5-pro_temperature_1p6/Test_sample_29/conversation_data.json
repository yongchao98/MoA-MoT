    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we first need to find the color of the light it emits. The energy of the emitted light can be converted to its corresponding wavelength.\n\nFirst, we calculate the wavelength (λ) of the emitted light using the given energy (E) of 2.3393 eV. The relationship between energy in electron volts (eV) and wavelength in nanometers (nm) is approximated by the formula:\n\nλ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 nm ≈ 530.07 nm\n\nA wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the green region of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\nThe color of light that a substance absorbs is typically the complementary color of the light that it reflects or emits. According to the traditional color wheel, the complementary color of green is red. This means that the dye absorbs red light, which is why it appears green (by emitting green light).\n\nTherefore, the color of light absorbed by the organic compound is red.\n\n<<<C>>>"
