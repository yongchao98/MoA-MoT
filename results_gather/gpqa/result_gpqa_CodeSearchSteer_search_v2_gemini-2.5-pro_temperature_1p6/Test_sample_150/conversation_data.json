    "To calculate the probability that a measurement of the observable P will yield the value 0, we follow the principles of quantum mechanics. The desired probability is found by projecting the system's state vector onto the eigenvector of the observable corresponding to the eigenvalue of 0.\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the State Vector\nFirst, the given state of the system at time *t* is the column matrix:\n|ψ⟩ = `(  -1  )`\n      `(   2   )`\n      `(   1   )`\n\nThis state vector must be normalized. The squared norm is calculated as:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nThe normalization constant is 1/√6. Therefore, the normalized state vector |ψ_norm⟩ is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `(  -1  )`\n                        `(   2   )`\n                        `(   1   )`\n\n### Step 2: Find the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues of the Observable\nThe observable *P* is represented by the matrix:\nP = `(   0     1/√2     0   )`\n    `(  1/√2     0     1/√2  )`\n    `(   0     1/√2     0   )`\n\nTo find the possible outcomes of a measurement, we must find the eigenvalues (λ) of *P* by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.\nThe eigenvalues for this matrix are λ = -1, 0, and 1. Since 0 is one of the eigenvalues, it is a possible outcome of the measurement.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue 0\nNext, we find the eigenvector |v₀⟩ corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0 by solving the equation P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩.\nLet |v₀⟩ be represented by the column vector (x, y, z)ᵀ. The equation becomes:\n\n`(   0     1/√2     0   ) (x)`   `(0)`\n`(  1/√2     0     1/√2  ) (y)` = `(0)`\n`(   0     1/√2     0   ) (z)`   `(0)`\n\nThis leads to the system of equations:\n1.  (1/√2)y = 0  ⇒  y = 0\n2.  (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  ⇒  x + z = 0  ⇒  x = -z\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form (x, 0, -x)ᵀ. To normalize this eigenvector, we set its norm to 1:\nx² + 0² + (-x)² = 1  ⇒  2x² = 1  ⇒  x = 1/√2\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is:\n|v₀⟩ = `(  1/√2  )`\n      `(    0    )`\n      `( -1/√2  )`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the corresponding normalized eigenvector with the normalized state vector. This is known as the Born rule.\n\nProbability(λ=0) = |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|²\n\nFirst, compute the inner product:\n⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = `(  1/√2   0   -1/√2  )` * (1/√6) * `(  -1  )`\n                                                     `(   2   )`\n                                                     `(   1   )`\n= (1/√12) * [ (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 ]  <- This calculation is incorrect in the prompt's reasoning. Let's recalculate the dot product of the vectors `[1/√2, 0, -1/√2]` and `(1/√6)*[-1, 2, 1]`.\n= (1/√6) * [ (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 ]\n= (1/√6) * [ -1/√2 - 1/√2 ]\n= (1/√6) * [ -2/√2 ]\n= -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3\n\nNow, square the magnitude of the result to find the probability:\nProbability(λ=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3\n\nThus, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
