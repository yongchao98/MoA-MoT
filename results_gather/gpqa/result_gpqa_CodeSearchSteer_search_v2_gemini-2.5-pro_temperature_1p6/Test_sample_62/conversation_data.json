    "The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivations:\n\n**1. Identify the Transition**\n\n*   The molecule is initially in its fundamental or ground state. For the rotation-vibration model, this corresponds to the lowest vibrational quantum number (`v=0`) and the lowest rotational quantum number (`J=0`).\n*   An absorbed photon causes the molecule to transition to a higher energy state. According to quantum mechanical selection rules for rovibrational transitions in a diatomic molecule, the change in the quantum numbers must be Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n*   Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only possible allowed transition to a higher state is to the state where v=1 and J=1 (since J cannot be negative).\n*   Therefore, the transition is from the initial state (v''=0, J''=0) to the final state (v'=1, J'=1).\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy of the Transition (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy of a state in the rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\n*   E(v, J) = E<sub>vibrational</sub> + E<sub>rotational</sub> = ħω(v + 1/2) + B * J(J + 1)\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10<sup>-34</sup> J·s)\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant\n\nThe energy of the initial and final states are:\n*   Initial State Energy: E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   Final State Energy: E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference (ΔE) between these states.\n\n*   ΔE = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0) = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + 2B\n\n**3. Calculate the Rotational Constant (B)**\n\nThe rotational constant `B` is defined as `B = ħ² / (2I)`, where `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):** For a diatomic molecule, `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass and `R` is the bond length.\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        *   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n        *   μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n        *   Converting to kilograms (1 amu ≈ 1.66 x 10<sup>-27</sup> kg):\n        *   μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66 x 10<sup>-27</sup> kg ≈ 3.018 x 10<sup>-27</sup> kg\n    *   **Calculate I:**\n        *   R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10<sup>-10</sup> m\n        *   I = (3.018 x 10<sup>-27</sup> kg) * (2 x 10<sup>-10</sup> m)² = 1.207 x 10<sup>-46</sup> kg·m²\n*   **Calculate B:**\n    *   B = (1.054 x 10<sup>-34</sup> J·s)² / (2 * 1.207 x 10<sup>-46</sup> kg·m²)\n    *   B ≈ 4.61 x 10<sup>-23</sup> J\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Transition Energy (ΔE)**\n\nNow, substitute the values back into the equation for ΔE:\n\n*   ΔE = ħω + 2B\n*   The vibrational energy term: ħω = (1.054 x 10<sup>-34</sup> J·s) * (4 x 10<sup>14</sup> rad/s) = 4.216 x 10<sup>-20</sup> J\n*   The rotational energy term: 2B = 2 * (4.61 x 10<sup>-23</sup> J) = 9.22 x 10<sup>-23</sup> J\n*   ΔE = (4.216 x 10<sup>-20</sup> J) + (9.22 x 10<sup>-23</sup> J) ≈ 4.217 x 10<sup>-20</sup> J\n    *   (Note: The rotational energy contribution is much smaller than the vibrational energy, which is typical).\n\n**5. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)**\n\nThe energy of a photon (E) is related to its momentum (p) and the speed of light (c) by the equation `E = pc`. Therefore, the momentum is `p = E / c`.\n\n*   p = (4.217 x 10<sup>-20</sup> J) / (3 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/s)\n*   p ≈ 1.406 x 10<sup>-28</sup> J·s/m\n*   Since 1 J·s/m = 1 N·s, the momentum is **p ≈ 1.4 x 10<sup>-28</sup> N·s**.\n\nThis calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
