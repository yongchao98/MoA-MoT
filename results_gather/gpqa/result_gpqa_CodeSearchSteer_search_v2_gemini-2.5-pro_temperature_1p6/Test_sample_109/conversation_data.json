    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, two primary conditions must be met: the star's position in the sky must be visible from both observatories, and its apparent brightness must be within the detection limits of both instruments.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nFor a star to be observable by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory in Chile and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, it must satisfy the magnitude and declination visibility criteria for both locations.\n\n**1. Magnitude Limits:**\n*   **ESPRESSO:** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 (m_V < 17).\n*   **HIRES:** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16 (m_V < 16).\n*   **Combined Requirement:** To be seen by both, a star must be brighter than magnitude 16 (m_V < 16).\n\n**2. Declination (Sky Position) Limits:**\n*   The **Keck Observatory** is in the Northern Hemisphere at a latitude of about +19.8 degrees. It can theoretically observe stars with a declination greater than approximately -70 degrees.\n*   The **Paranal Observatory** is in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of about -24.6 degrees. It can theoretically observe stars with a declination less than approximately +65 degrees.\n*   **Combined Requirement:** A star must have a declination between -70 degrees and +65 degrees to be visible from both locations.\n\n**Star-by-Star Analysis:**\n\n*   **Star1:**\n    *   **Declination:** -75 degrees. This is not visible from Keck Observatory.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude:** 16.5 mag. This is not brighter than HIRES's limit of 16 mag.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   **Declination:** +48 degrees. This is visible from both Paranal and Keck.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude:** 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the 16 mag limit for both instruments. The additional information about color excess is not needed as the final apparent magnitude is given.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Can** be detected by both.\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:** The apparent magnitude (m_V) is calculated using the formula: m_V = M_V + 5*log10(d) - 5 + A_V, where M_V is the absolute magnitude, d is the distance, and A_V is the absorption.\n        *   A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   m_V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   This apparent magnitude of 16.74 is not brighter than HIRES's limit of 16 mag.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   **Declination:** +60 degrees. This is visible from both Paranal and Keck.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:** m_V = M_V + 5*log10(d) - 5.\n        *   m_V = 16.5 + 5*log10(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   This apparent magnitude is brighter than the 16 mag limit.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Can** be detected by both.\n\nBased on this analysis, only Star3 and Star5 meet the criteria for detection by both observatories.\n\n<<<B>>>"
