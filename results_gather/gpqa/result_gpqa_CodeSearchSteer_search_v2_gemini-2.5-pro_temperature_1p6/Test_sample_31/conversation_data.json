    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total energy of a Lithium-6 (⁶Li) nucleus moving at a relativistic speed of 0.96c. The nucleus X, defined as Li with 3 neutrons, has 3 protons (the atomic number of Lithium) and 3 neutrons, giving it a mass number of 6.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the rest mass of the ⁶Li nucleus.**\n    The provided search results give the atomic mass of a ⁶Li *atom*, which includes its 3 electrons.\n    *   The atomic mass of ⁶Li is 6.015122887 atomic mass units (u).\n    *   To find the mass of the nucleus, we must subtract the mass of the 3 electrons. The rest mass of a single electron is approximately 0.0005486 u or 0.511 MeV/c².\n    *   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.0005486 u = 0.0016458 u.\n    *   Mass of ⁶Li nucleus = 6.015122887 u - 0.0016458 u = 6.013477 u.\n    *   We convert this mass to energy in MeV using the conversion factor 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c².\n    *   Rest mass (m₀) of ⁶Li nucleus ≈ 6.013477 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u ≈ 5601.55 MeV/c².\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor is a function of the velocity (v) and the speed of light (c).\n    *   v = 0.96c\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714\n\n3.  **Calculate the total energy (E).**\n    The total energy is given by the relativistic formula E = γm₀c². The \"energy of the collider\" in this context refers to the total energy imparted to the nucleus, not just its kinetic energy.\n    *   E = 3.5714 * 5601.55 MeV\n    *   E ≈ 20005.4 MeV\n\n4.  **Convert the energy to Giga-electronvolts (GeV).**\n    Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, we convert the result.\n    *   E ≈ 20005.4 MeV / 1000 MeV/GeV ≈ 20.0054 GeV.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The calculated total energy is approximately 20.0054 GeV. Let's recalculate with higher precision to match the options.\n\n    *   More precise atomic mass of ⁶Li: 6.015122887 u.\n    *   More precise electron mass: 0.0005485799 u.\n    *   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.0005485799 u = 0.0016457397 u.\n    *   Mass of ⁶Li nucleus = 6.015122887 u - 0.0016457397 u = 6.0134771473 u.\n    *   More precise conversion factor: 1 u = 931.494102 MeV/c².\n    *   Rest mass of ⁶Li nucleus (m₀c²) = 6.0134771473 u * 931.494102 MeV/u ≈ 5601.534 MeV.\n\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857...\n    *   Total Energy (E) = γ * m₀c² = 3.57142857 * 5601.534 MeV ≈ 20005.478 MeV.\n    *   Total Energy (E) ≈ 20.005 GeV.\n\nThis value is very close to 20.132 GeV. Let's re-examine the definition of \"energy of the RHIC\". Often, the energy specified for a collider refers to the kinetic energy per nucleon. Let's calculate that.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy (K):** K = (γ - 1)m₀c²\n    *   K = (3.5714 - 1) * 5601.534 MeV = 2.5714 * 5601.534 MeV ≈ 14403.9 MeV ≈ 14.404 GeV. This is not among the options.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy per nucleon:**\n    *   K / A = 14.404 GeV / 6 ≈ 2.40 GeV/nucleon. Also not a match.\n\nThe question is most likely asking for the total energy of the nucleus, and there might be a slight variation in the mass constants used. Let's re-evaluate based on the closest option, 20.132 GeV.\n\nIf E = 20.132 GeV = 20132 MeV, then the rest mass used would be:\nm₀c² = E / γ = 20132 MeV / 3.57142857... ≈ 5637 MeV.\nThis corresponds to a mass of 5637 MeV / 931.494 MeV/u ≈ 6.05 u, which is consistent with a Lithium-6 nucleus.\n\nThe small discrepancy between the calculated 20.005 GeV and the option 20.132 GeV likely stems from the exact values of physical constants used for the problem's options or a slightly different interpretation. However, 20.005 GeV is significantly closer to 20.132 GeV than any other option.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is 20.132 GeV.\n\nFinal Check:\n*   Rest Mass Energy (E₀) ≈ 5.602 GeV\n*   Lorentz Factor (γ) for 0.96c ≈ 3.571\n*   Total Energy (E = γE₀) ≈ 3.571 * 5.602 GeV ≈ 20.005 GeV.\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
