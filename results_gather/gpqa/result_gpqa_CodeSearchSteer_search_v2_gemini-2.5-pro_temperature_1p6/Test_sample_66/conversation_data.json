    "The fundamental principle that governs this problem is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum during a measurement.\n\nThe two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\nHere is a breakdown of the quantum numbers:\n*   $l_1 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (since it's in a p-orbital).\n*   $l_2 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a p-orbital).\n*   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nThe z-component of the total angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The corresponding quantum numbers are related by the equation:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nIn this specific state, the system has a definite value for the total z-component of angular momentum, which is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. Any measurement of the individual components, $m_1$ and $m_2$, must sum up to this total value.\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the system with $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nIf such a measurement were to occur, the total z-component of the angular momentum would be:\n$m = m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nThis result, $m=-2$, contradicts the given state of the system, which has $m=-1$. Because the proposed measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is an impossible event. The probability of an impossible event is 0.\n\nTo further formalize this, the state $|l, m\\rangle$ can be expanded in terms of the uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle$ using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The probability of measuring the individual components to be $m_1$ and $m_2$ is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$. A key property of these coefficients is that they are zero unless $m = m_1 + m_2$. In this case, we are interested in the coefficient $\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$. Since $-1 + (-1) = -2 \\neq -1$, the coefficient is zero, and thus the probability is also zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
