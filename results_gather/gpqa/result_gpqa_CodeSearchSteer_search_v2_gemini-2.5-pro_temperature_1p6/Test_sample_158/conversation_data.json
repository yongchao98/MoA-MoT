    "The problem asks for the comoving distance to a quasar with a specific spectral feature, observed in a universe defined by the Lambda-CDM model with given cosmological parameters.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Spectral Feature and Calculate Redshift (z)\n\nThe observed spectrum of the quasar shows a peak at a wavelength of 790 nm, with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This feature is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line, which is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. The drop in flux at shorter wavelengths is caused by the absorption of light by intervening neutral hydrogen, known as the Lyman-alpha forest.\n\nThe rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition is 121.6 nm (or 1215.67 Å).\n\nThe redshift (z) can be calculated using the formula:\nz = (λ_observed - λ_rest) / λ_rest\n\nGiven:\n*   λ_observed = 790 nm\n*   λ_rest = 121.6 nm\n\nCalculation:\nz = (790 nm - 121.6 nm) / 121.6 nm = 668.4 / 121.6 ≈ 5.5\n\nSo, the redshift of the quasar is approximately 5.5.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Comoving Distance\n\nThe comoving distance is the distance between two objects that remains constant over time if the objects are moving with the Hubble flow (i.e., their separation changes only due to the expansion of the universe). For a flat Lambda-CDM universe, the comoving distance (Dc) is calculated by integrating over redshift.\n\nThe cosmological parameters are given as:\n*   Hubble Constant (H₀) = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Matter Density Parameter (Ω_m) = 0.3\n*   Dark Energy Density Parameter (Ω_Λ) = 0.7\n*   The universe is flat, which is consistent with Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1.0.\n\nUsing these parameters and the calculated redshift (z = 5.5), we can employ a standard cosmology calculator to find the comoving distance. Several online tools are available for this purpose.\n\nInputting the values:\n*   H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Ω_m = 0.3\n*   Ω_Λ = 0.7\n*   z = 5.5\n\nA cosmology calculator, such as Ned Wright's Cosmology Calculator, provides the comoving radial distance. For these parameters, the result is approximately 8002.8 Mpc.\n\nThis value is equivalent to 8.0 Gpc.\n\n### Step 3: Compare with the Given Options\n\nThe calculated comoving distance is approximately 8.0 Gpc. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 9 Gpc\nB) 8 Gpc\nC) 6 Gpc\nD) 7 Gpc\n\nThe calculated value of 8.0 Gpc matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
