    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant Îº and the renormalizability of the theory, we must analyze the given interaction Lagrangian:\n\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension Analysis\n\nIn natural units (where $\\hbar = c = 1$), the action $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$ is dimensionless. Since the spacetime element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of $[d^4x] = M^{-4}$, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $[L] = M^4$. This means every term in the Lagrangian, including the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$, must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\nNext, we determine the mass dimension of each component in the interaction term:\n\n*   **Fermion Field ($\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$):** The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{fermion} \\propto \\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi$. For this to have a mass dimension of 4, with $[\\partial_\\mu] = M^1$, we find that $2[\\psi] + 1 = 4$. Therefore, the mass dimension of the fermion field is $[\\psi] = [\\bar{\\psi}] = M^{3/2}$.\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{EM} \\propto F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we must have $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4$, which gives the mass dimension of the field strength tensor as $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$.\n*   **Sigma Matrix ($\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$):** The term $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is defined as $\\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$, where $\\gamma_\\mu$ are the Dirac gamma matrices. These matrices are dimensionless. Consequently, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless, so $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^0$.\n\nNow we can calculate the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ by ensuring the total mass dimension of $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$ is 4:\n\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4$\n\nSubstituting the known dimensions:\n\n$[\\kappa] + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4$\n\n$[\\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4$\n\n$[\\kappa] + 5 = 4$\n\n$[\\kappa] = -1$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### 2. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. The criteria are as follows:\n*   **Renormalizable:** The coupling constant is dimensionless ($[g] = 0$).\n*   **Super-renormalizable:** The coupling constant has a positive mass dimension ($[g] > 0$).\n*   **Non-renormalizable:** The coupling constant has a negative mass dimension ($[g] < 0$).\n\nSince we found that $[\\kappa] = -1$, the theory is non-renormalizable. In such theories, attempts to cancel infinities that arise in loop calculations at higher orders in perturbation theory require the introduction of an infinite number of counterterms, which causes the theory to lose its predictive power.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and because it is negative, the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
