    "The scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\\\(\\vec{A}\\\\)) for a moving point charge are described by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the finite speed of light, meaning the field observed at a point \\\\(\\vec{r}\\\\) at time *t* was generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *tr*.\n\nThe retarded time *tr* is defined by the condition that the time difference *t - tr* is equal to the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at *tr* to the observation point \\\\(\\vec{r}\\\\). This distance is given by the magnitude of the vector \\\\(\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)\\\\), so \\\\(t - t_r = d/c\\\\).\n\nThe derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials from the general formulas for retarded potentials involves careful integration over the charge distribution of the moving point, which is represented by a Dirac delta function. The result of this derivation yields the following expressions for the scalar and vector potentials:\n\nScalar Potential:\n\\\\(V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}\\\\)\n\nVector Potential:\n\\\\(\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}\\\\)\n\nHere, all the quantities related to the charge (its position \\\\(\\vec{s}\\\\), velocity \\\\(\\vec{v}\\\\), and the separation vector \\\\(\\vec{d}\\\\)) are evaluated at the retarded time *tr*.\n\nTo match the form given in the options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator of these expressions by *c*:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n\\\\(V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}\\\\)\n\nFor the vector potential \\\\(\\vec{A}\\\\):\n\\\\(\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}\\\\)\n\nThese expressions correspond precisely to option A. The other options are incorrect. Option B and C use the static Coulomb potential form, which is not valid for a moving charge as it neglects retardation effects. Option D incorrectly uses a plus sign in the denominator. The minus sign is crucial as it accounts for the Doppler-like effect on the potential: the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer (\\\\(\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0\\\\)) and weaker if it is moving away.\n\n<<<A>>>"
