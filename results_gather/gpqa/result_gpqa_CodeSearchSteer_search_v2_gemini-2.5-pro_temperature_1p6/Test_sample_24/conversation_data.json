    "**Analysis of Reaction 1**\nThe first reaction shows a reactant 'A' that, when treated with sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), produces 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one. This transformation, converting a 1,2-diol (also known as a vicinal diol or glycol) into a ketone or aldehyde, is characteristic of the Pinacol rearrangement. The reaction is acid-catalyzed, where a protonated hydroxyl group leaves as a water molecule to form a carbocation. This is followed by the migration of an alkyl group from the adjacent carbon, leading to a rearranged carbon skeleton. Starting from a diol on a fused ring system like a decalin (octahydronaphthalene) to form a spirocyclic ketone is a classic example of this type of rearrangement. Therefore, reactant A is most likely a diol, specifically 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction 2**\nThe second reaction involves reactant 'B' reacting with butyllithium (BuLi), a strong base, followed by an acidic workup (H⁺) to yield 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol, a homoallylic alcohol. The options for reactant B are an ether or a ketone. If B were a ketone, the organolithium reagent (BuLi) would act as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl group and adding a butyl group to the molecule. However, the final product does not contain a butyl group. This rules out the ketone as the reactant.\n\nThe other option for B is (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene, which is a benzyl prenyl ether. When an allyl ether, like this one, is treated with a strong base such as BuLi, the base deprotonates the carbon adjacent to both the oxygen and the phenyl group. The resulting carbanion then undergoes a concerted rearrangement known as the-Wittig rearrangement. This sigmatropic reaction leads to the formation of a homoallylic alcohol after protonation by the acid workup. This pathway perfectly matches the given transformation.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Reactant A must be the diol, `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol`, to undergo the Pinacol rearrangement.\n*   Reactant B must be the ether, `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene`, to undergo the-Wittig rearrangement.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of reactants is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
