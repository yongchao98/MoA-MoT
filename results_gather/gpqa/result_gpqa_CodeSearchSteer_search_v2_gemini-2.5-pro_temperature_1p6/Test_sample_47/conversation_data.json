    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations and the final product.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1**\n    This reaction is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. One bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heat) → Product 2**\n    When an α-halo ketone is treated with a base like sodium hydroxide, it can undergo a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate followed by ring contraction. In this case, 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) → Product 3**\n    This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). The product is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Product 4**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, the final product, Product 4, is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**.\n\n### Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde, we must analyze its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde (-CHO) group. Due to rapid conformational flipping at room temperature, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the rest of the ring.\n\nLet's count the sets of non-equivalent protons:\n1.  **Aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. That's one distinct type.\n2.  **Proton on C1:** The proton on the carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. That's a second type.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (they are not equivalent to each other). The \"upper\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, and the \"lower\" protons are equivalent to each other. This gives two more distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in another two distinct types of hydrogens.\n\nIn total, adding up the different types: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = 6.\n\nTherefore, cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, which would correspond to 6 signals in a proton NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
