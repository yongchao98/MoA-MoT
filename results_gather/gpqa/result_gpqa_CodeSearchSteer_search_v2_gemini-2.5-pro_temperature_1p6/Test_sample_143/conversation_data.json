    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the mean decay distance of the X meson resonance.\n\n**1. Understand the relevant physical principles**\n\n*   **Decay Width and Lifetime:** The lifetime (τ) of an unstable particle is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ). The relationship is given by the formula τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Time Dilation:** In the laboratory frame, the lifetime of a moving particle appears longer than its proper lifetime (the lifetime in its own rest frame). This effect, called time dilation, is described by the formula τ_lab = γ * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Mean Decay Distance:** The mean decay distance (d) is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays. It is the product of the particle's velocity (v) in the lab frame and its dilated lifetime (τ_lab). So, d = v * τ_lab.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The Lorentz factor γ is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass (m), so γ = E/m. The particle's velocity is usually expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, β = v/c, and is related to γ by β = √(1 - 1/γ²).\n\n**2. List the given values and constants**\n\n*   Production energy (E_X): 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Mass (m_X): 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n*   Decay width (Γ_X): 320 MeV\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ): ~6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s\n*   Speed of light (c): ~3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   A useful combination is ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m).\n\n**3. Perform the calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**\n    γ = E_X / m_X = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 80 / 12 = 20/3.\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the proper lifetime (τ)**\n    τ = ħ / Γ_X = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s.\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the particle's velocity factor (β)**\n    β = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) = √391 / 20 ≈ 0.9887.\n\n*   **Step D: Calculate the mean decay distance (d)**\n    The formula for the mean decay distance is d = v * τ_lab = (βc) * (γτ) = βγcτ.\n\n    A more direct calculation can be done using the quantity ħc:\n    d = βγ * c * (ħ/Γ) = βγ * (ħc/Γ)\n    Since βγ = √(γ² - 1), we have:\n    d = √(γ² - 1) * (ħc / Γ)\n    d = √((20/3)² - 1) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\n    d = √(400/9 - 1) * (0.61656 fm)\n    d = √(391/9) * (0.61656 fm)\n    d = (√391 / 3) * (0.61656 fm)\n    d ≈ (19.774 / 3) * 0.61656 fm\n    d ≈ 6.591 * 0.61656 fm\n    d ≈ 4.0645 fm\n\n*   **Step E: Convert units and compare with options**\n    Since 1 femtometer (fm) = 10⁻¹⁵ meters (m), the calculated mean decay distance is approximately 4.0645 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\nThis value is extremely close to option C. The minor difference (about 0.02%) is due to the precision of the physical constants used.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
