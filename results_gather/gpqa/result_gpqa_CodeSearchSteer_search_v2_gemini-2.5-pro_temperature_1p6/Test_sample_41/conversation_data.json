    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem about exoplanets.\nI have already laid out the steps and performed the calculation.\nMy reasoning relies on two key physical laws:\n1.  The relationship between equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and semi-major axis (a). I deduced T_eq ∝ 1/√a.\n2.  Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (P) and semi-major axis (a). I know that P² ∝ a³.\n\nThe search results confirm my understanding of these principles.\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law**: The search results universally confirm that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit (P² ∝ a³). This holds true for any planets orbiting the same central star.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature**: The search results confirm that the planetary equilibrium temperature is calculated based on the balance between absorbed stellar radiation and emitted thermal radiation. One source explicitly states the relationship I used: \"If the distance between the planet and the star is four times greater, then the temperature of the planet will be halved. (This time the planet temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of distance from the star...).\" This confirms T_eq ∝ 1/√a (where 'a' is the distance or semi-major axis for a circular orbit).\n\nThe calculation was:\n1.  Find the ratio of the semi-major axes using the temperature ratios:\n    *   a2 / a1 = (T1 / T2)² ≈ 1.4² = 1.96\n    *   a3 / a2 = (T2 / T3)² ≈ 2.3² = 5.29\n2.  Combine these to find the ratio of the outermost to the innermost semi-major axis:\n    *   a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n3.  Use Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the orbital periods:\n    *   P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) ≈ (10.3684)^(3/2) ≈ 33.386\n\nThe result is approximately 33.4, which corresponds to option D.\n\nThe provided information about the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is extraneous and not needed for the calculation, which is based on the planets' orbital mechanics and radiative equilibrium with their star. The specific value of the albedo is also irrelevant as long as it's the same for all three planets, as it cancels out in the temperature ratio.\n\nThe plan is solid and confirmed by the search results. I am ready to present the final answer. To solve the problem and determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit around its star is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs and the energy it radiates. The formula shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (a), or orbital distance for a circular orbit (T_eq ∝ 1/√a). This relationship holds true as all three planets share the same star and have the same albedo.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratios of the Orbital Distances:** Using the given temperature ratios, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances.\n    *   Given: T_eq(Planet1) / T_eq(Planet2) ≈ 1.4\n    *   This implies: √[a(Planet2) / a(Planet1)] ≈ 1.4\n    *   Squaring both sides: a(Planet2) / a(Planet1) ≈ 1.4² = 1.96\n\n    *   Given: T_eq(Planet2) / T_eq(Planet3) ≈ 2.3\n    *   This implies: √[a(Planet3) / a(Planet2)] ≈ 2.3\n    *   Squaring both sides: a(Planet3) / a(Planet2) ≈ 2.3² = 5.29\n\n3.  **Determine the Overall Orbital Distance Ratio:** To find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to that of Planet1, we multiply the individual ratios.\n    *   a(Planet3) / a(Planet1) = [a(Planet3) / a(Planet2)] * [a(Planet2) / a(Planet1)]\n    *   a(Planet3) / a(Planet1) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (P² ∝ a³). Therefore, the ratio of the periods is the ratio of the semi-major axes to the power of 3/2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orbital Period Ratio:**\n    *   P(Planet3) / P(Planet1) = [a(Planet3) / a(Planet1)]^(3/2)\n    *   P(Planet3) / P(Planet1) ≈ (10.3684)^(3/2)\n    *   P(Planet3) / P(Planet1) ≈ 10.3684 * √10.3684\n    *   P(Planet3) / P(Planet1) ≈ 10.3684 * 3.22\n    *   P(Planet3) / P(Planet1) ≈ 33.386\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the planetary masses, the TTV discovery method, and the specific albedo value of 0.3 is not necessary for this calculation, as the principles used only depend on the planets orbiting the same star with identical albedos.\n\n<<<D>>>"
