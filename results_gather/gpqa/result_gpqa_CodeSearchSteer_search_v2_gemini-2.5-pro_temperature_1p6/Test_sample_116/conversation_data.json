    "### Analysis of the Compounds for Optical Isomerism:\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. This property can arise from a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or from axial chirality, where the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry due to restricted rotation around a bond.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    This molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as biphenyls. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, leads to a stable, non-planar conformation. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, resulting in axial chirality and thus, optical isomerism. Biphenyls with sufficient steric hindrance at the ortho-positions are known to be resolvable into optically active enantiomers. The discovery of this phenomenon was first demonstrated in a related compound, 6,6'-dinitrodiphenic acid.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    This compound, also known as methyl lactate, is the methyl ester of lactic acid. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (D/L or R/S forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, it is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism. While specially substituted benzophenones can be made chiral, the parent molecule itself is not.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ with the ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the C=C bond. Due to these symmetry elements, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate and dimethyl maleate are geometric isomers (diastereomers), not optical isomers.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) exhibits optical isomerism due to atropisomerism, and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) shows optical isomerism because it has a chiral carbon. Benzophenone (3) and dimethyl fumarate (4) are both achiral molecules and therefore do not exhibit optical isomerism. Thus, the correct combination is 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
