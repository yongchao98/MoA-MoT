    "To determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe stability constant (K_f) for this reaction is given as 5 x 10¹⁰.\n\nThe dissociation of the complex is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d) is the reciprocal of the stability constant:\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the dissociation is:\nK_d = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\nSubstituting the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nSince the stability constant is very large, the dissociation will be very small, meaning 'x' will be negligible compared to 0.02. We can simplify the equation to:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² = (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² = 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = 2 x 10⁻⁶․⁵\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nB) 2.0x10⁻² M\nC) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
