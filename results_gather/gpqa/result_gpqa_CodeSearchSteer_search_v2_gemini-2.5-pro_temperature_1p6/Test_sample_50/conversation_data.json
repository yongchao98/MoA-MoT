    "I have found information on how to solve the problem using the method of images. A point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` induces an image charge `q' = -qR/d` at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, inside the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. However, there's a subtlety: the potential energy is not simply the potential of the image charge multiplied by the real charge. There's a factor of 1/2 involved because the induced charge on the sphere is not a fixed charge but depends on the position of `q`.\n\nI need to clarify the exact formula for the potential energy of interaction between a point charge and a grounded sphere. I will perform a new search to find the precise expression for this potential energy, which should resolve the \"factor of two\" issue mentioned in one of the search results.The previous searches have confirmed that the method of images is the correct approach. For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, an image charge `q' = -qR/d` is induced at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n\nThe key finding is that the potential energy of the system is *half* the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. This \"factor of two\" discrepancy arises because the induced charge is not a fixed entity but is created by the presence of the real charge. The work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity is not simply `q` times the potential of the image charge, but includes the energy stored in the field of the induced charge distribution itself, which accounts for the factor of 1/2.\n\nTherefore, I have sufficient information to calculate the final answer. The interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (distance between them)`. The distance between the real charge at `d` and the image charge at `b = R^2/d` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`. The potential energy of the system is `U = (1/2) * U_interaction`. I will now proceed to the final calculation.\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. This can be calculated as half of the interaction energy between the charge `q` and its image `q'`.\n\n1.  **Image charge and its position:**\n    *   Image charge: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   Position of image charge from the center: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n2.  **Distance between the real charge and the image charge:**\n    *   The real charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The image charge `q'` is at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the real charge.\n    *   Distance between `q` and `q'` = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n3.  **Interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge:**\n    *   `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (distance between them)`\n    *   `U_interaction = k * q * (-R/d * q) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n    *   `U_interaction = - (k * q^2 * R / d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n    *   `U_interaction = - k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Net potential energy of the system:**\n    *   As established from the search results, the net potential energy is half of the interaction energy.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * [- k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option C.The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n\nTo solve this, we can use the method of images. This method allows us to replace the conducting sphere with an \"image\" charge, which, along with the real charge, satisfies the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\nThe image charge, `q'`, is located inside the sphere along the line connecting the center and the real charge `q`. Its magnitude and position are given by:\n*   `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   Position of image charge from the center, `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work can be calculated by finding the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.  A crucial point is that the net potential energy is half the interaction energy between the real and image charges. This is because the induced charge on the sphere is not a fixed charge but is created by the presence of the real charge.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`:\nDistance = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nNext, we calculate the interaction energy (`U_interaction`) between `q` and `q'`:\n`U_interaction = k * q * q' / (distance between them)`\n`U_interaction = k * q * (-(R/d) * q) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n`U_interaction = - (k * q^2 * R / d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n`U_interaction = - k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThe net potential energy of the system (`U`) is half of this interaction energy:\n`U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n`U = (1/2) * [- k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, let's compare this result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur calculated expression for the potential energy matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
