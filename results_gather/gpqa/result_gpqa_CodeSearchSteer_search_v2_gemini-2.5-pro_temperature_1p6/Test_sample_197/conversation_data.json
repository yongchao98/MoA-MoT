    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we must calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This fraction, known as the distribution coefficient (α₂), can be calculated using the stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]).\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the free Co(II) ions and all the thiocyanato complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), the concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺]:\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe formula for the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (α₂) is:\nα₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for each species, the [Co²⁺] term cancels out, and the formula becomes:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nGiven the values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, we calculate the denominator (D), which represents the sum of all relative concentrations:\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator (N), which corresponds to the dithiocyanato complex:\nN = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we can find the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = N / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
