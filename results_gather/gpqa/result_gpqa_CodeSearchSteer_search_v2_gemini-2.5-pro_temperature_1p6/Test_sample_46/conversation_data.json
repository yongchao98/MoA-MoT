    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### **1. Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a clear indication of a primary amine (-NH₂). This results from the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption band is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). The specific frequency suggests an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring, which typically absorbs in the 1715-1730 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is typical for the N-H protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The signal is broad due to fast chemical exchange and quadrupolar relaxation from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The downfield chemical shift (~3.7-4.5 ppm) is highly indicative of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (R-CO-O-**CH₂**-CH₃).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two sets of protons on the ring are chemically different and split each other. The significant difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n### **3. Assembling the Structure**\n\n1.  The IR and NMR data confirm a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n2.  The ¹H NMR signals at 1.20 ppm (triplet) and 4.5 ppm (quartet) confirm the presence of an ethyl ester group (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n3.  The IR signal at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with an ester carbonyl group conjugated with a benzene ring.\n4.  The aromatic signals in the ¹H NMR point to a benzene ring with two substituents in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n5.  The two substituents are the primary amine (-NH₂), an electron-donating group, and the ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and would not have a 2H broad singlet for an -NH₂ group in the NMR.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has a primary amide, which is consistent with the IR, but the meta-substitution on the benzene ring would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, a para-disubstituted aromatic ring, and an ethyl ester group. The formula C₉H₁₁NO₂ is correct.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acid portion (H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-**CH₂CH₃**). The quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would appear much further upfield, around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
