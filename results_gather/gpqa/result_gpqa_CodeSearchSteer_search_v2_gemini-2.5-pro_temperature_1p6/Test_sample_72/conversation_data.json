    "To determine the correct option, we must calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nSince both astronauts are traveling in the same positive x-direction, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula to find their speed relative to each other. The formula is:\n\n*v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁v₂) / c²)*\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, v₁ = 0.6c\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, v₂ = 0.5c\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n*   v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\n*   v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\n*   v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\n*   v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n*   **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**\n\n### 2. Total Energy (E_total)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic system is the sum of the individual total energies of its components. The total energy of a single particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E₁):**\n*   Mass, m₁ = 2m\n*   Velocity, v₁ = 0.6c\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, γ₁:\n    *   γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)² / c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Now, calculate the energy, E₁:\n    *   E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5mc²\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E₂):**\n*   Mass, m₂ = 3m\n*   Velocity, v₂ = 0.5c\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, γ₂:\n    *   γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)² / c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1.1547\n*   Now, calculate the energy, E₂:\n    *   E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641mc²\n\n**Total System Energy (E_total):**\n*   E_total = E₁ + E₂\n*   E_total = 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc²\n*   **E_total ≈ 5.96mc²**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are a relative speed of approximately **0.14c** and a total system energy of approximately **5.96mc²**. These results match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
