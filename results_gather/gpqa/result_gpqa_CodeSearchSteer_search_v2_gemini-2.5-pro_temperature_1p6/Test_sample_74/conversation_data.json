  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine the cause of the failed protein expression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed. The protein should begin with a start codon, followed by the sequence for the HA tag, and then the coding sequence for the GADD45G protein.\n\n1.  **Start Codon**: Translation of a protein begins at a start codon, which is typically `ATG` in the DNA sequence and codes for the amino acid Methionine. The provided sequence correctly begins with `5'-ATG...`.\n2.  **HA Tag Sequence**: The influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag has a standard amino acid sequence of YPYDVPDYA. The DNA sequence that codes for this is 5'-TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT-3'. Examining the construct's sequence after the `ATG` start codon:\n    `5'...TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC...3'`\n    This DNA sequence correctly codes for the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA, meaning there is no missense mutation in the antigenic determinant.\n3.  **Reading Frame Analysis**: The ribosome reads the genetic code in triplets, or codons. We must continue reading the sequence in this frame to see what follows the HA tag.\n    *   **Start Codon**: `ATG` (Methionine)\n    *   **HA Tag**: `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC` (YPYDVPDYA)\n    *   **Sequence immediately following the tag**: The next codons are `AAA` followed by `TGA`.\n4.  **Identification of the Stop Codon**: The codon `TGA` is a stop codon (also known as a termination codon). When the ribosome encounters a stop codon, it terminates translation, and the protein synthesis is halted.\n\nThe provided DNA sequence contains a premature `TGA` stop codon immediately after the HA tag sequence (with one additional codon, `AAA`, for Lysine, in between). This causes the ribosome to stop translation after producing only a very short peptide (Met-YPYDVPDYA-Lys), preventing the synthesis of the full-length GADD45G protein. This perfectly explains why the overexpression of the desired protein was not observed.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** This is incorrect. The primary issue is that the full protein is never synthesized due to the premature stop codon.\n*   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. As shown above, the HA tag is sequenced correctly.\n*   **C) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is correct. The presence of the `TGA` stop codon immediately following the tag sequence caused premature termination of translation.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect for three reasons: the experiment was in hamster cells, there are no tRNAs for any of the three standard stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA), and the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `UAA`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
