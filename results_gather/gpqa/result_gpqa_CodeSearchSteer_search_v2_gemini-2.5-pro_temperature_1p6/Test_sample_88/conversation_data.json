    "To determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, we must first deduce the structure of product 3 by analyzing the given reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Product 1 Formation:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base (KOH) at high temperature. The provided spectral data for product 1 (a ketone with 14 protons, including two at a very unusual chemical shift of 4.79 ppm) is inconsistent with known, simple adamantane derivatives. There seems to be a discrepancy in the problem's description of Product 1.\n\n2.  **Product 2 Formation:** Product 1, described as having a ketone group (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹), is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones and aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols.\n\n3.  **Product 3 Formation:** Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis, followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This implies that Product 2 must be an alkene.\n\n**Plausible Reaction Pathway**\n\nDespite the confusing data for Product 1, a chemically plausible reaction pathway can be proposed based on the types of reactions involved:\n*   **Product 1** is a ketone derived from the adamantane skeleton. Let's assume it is **2-adamantanone**, a stable C₁₀H₁₄O ketone, and that the provided spectral data is erroneous.\n*   **Product 2** is formed from the reaction of 2-adamantanone. The MPV reduction would yield 2-adamantanol. Subsequent heating, likely causing dehydration and rearrangement (a known process to relieve ring strain), would lead to the formation of an alkene. The most likely alkene product in this context is **protoadamantene**.\n*   **Product 3** is the result of the ozonolysis of protoadamantene. The ozonolysis of protoadamantene is a known reaction that cleaves the double bond and, after rearrangement and loss of one carbon atom as formaldehyde (during the DMS workup), yields **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione**.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nProduct 3 is identified as **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione**. We need to find the coupling pattern of its most deshielded, non-exchangeable hydrogen atom.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione is a symmetrical molecule with a C₂ axis. It typically adopts a twin-chair conformation.\n*   **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded protons in the structure are the two bridgehead protons (at C1 and C5). These protons are alpha to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, causing a significant downfield shift. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these two protons are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Determining the Coupling Pattern:** Let's analyze the couplings for the proton at C1 (H1). This proton is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, which are C8 and C9.\n    *   H1 is coupled to the two protons on the C8 methylene group.\n    *   H1 is also coupled to the two protons on the C9 methylene bridge.\n    *   Therefore, H1 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n\nIn the twin-chair conformation, the four neighboring protons are not magnetically equivalent. Their coupling constants with H1 depend on their respective dihedral angles:\n*   The coupling to two of the protons will have one value (J₁).\n*   The coupling to the other two protons will have a different value (J₂).\n\nAccording to literature data, the coupling constants for this proton fall into two distinct pairs (e.g., J₁ ≈ 6.5 Hz and J₂ ≈ 3 Hz). The splitting pattern arises as follows:\n1.  The two neighboring protons with the larger coupling constant (J₁) split the H1 signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n2.  Each line of this triplet is then split again by the other two neighboring protons with the smaller coupling constant (J₂), also resulting in a **triplet**.\n\nThe resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
