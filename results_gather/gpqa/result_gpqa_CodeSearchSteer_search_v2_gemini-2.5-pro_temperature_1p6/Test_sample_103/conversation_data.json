    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to answer the question.\n\n### 1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method, or Doppler spectroscopy, detects exoplanets by observing the periodic shift in the spectral lines of their host star. This shift is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as it and the planet orbit their common center of mass. The measured shift in wavelength (Δλ) is related to the star's radial velocity (the component of its velocity along our line of sight) by the Doppler effect.\n\nThe amplitude of the periodic velocity change is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted as K. The observed wavelength shift, Δλ, is directly proportional to this velocity amplitude, K. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes of the two stars (K₁ and K₂) is equal to the ratio of their measured wavelength shifts (Δλ₁ and Δλ₂).\n\nGiven:\n*   Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstrom\n*   Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstrom\n\nThe ratio of the velocity amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n### 2. The Radial Velocity Formula\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star is given by the formula:\n\nK ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   m_p is the mass of the planet.\n*   M_star is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the planet's orbit to our line of sight.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 3. Setting up the Ratio\n\nWe can write this equation for both planet-star systems:\n\n*   For planet #1: K₁ ≈ C * (m_p1 * sin(i₁)) / (M₁^(2/3) * P₁^(1/3))\n*   For planet #2: K₂ ≈ C * (m_p2 * sin(i₂)) / (M₂^(2/3) * P₂^(1/3))\n\nWhere C is the constant part, (2πG)^(1/3).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know:\n*   The stars have the same mass: M₁ = M₂\n*   The planets have similar masses: m_p1 ≈ m_p2\n\nThe radial velocity method can only determine the value of *m_p* sin(i), not the mass and inclination separately. Since the problem doesn't provide the inclinations, we must assume they are similar for both systems (i₁ ≈ i₂), which is a standard approach for such comparative problems.\n\nUnder these conditions, most terms in the ratio of K₂ to K₁ cancel out:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = [(m_p2 * sin(i₂)) / (M₂^(2/3) * P₂^(1/3))] / [(m_p1 * sin(i₁)) / (M₁^(2/3) * P₁^(1/3))]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n### 4. Calculating the Period Ratio\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital periods, P₂ / P₁. We can rearrange the simplified equation to solve for this:\n\nP₁ / P₂ = (K₂ / K₁)^3\n\nNow, substitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts):\n\nP₁ / P₂ = (7 / 5)^3 = 343 / 125 = 2.744\n\nTo find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is than that of planet #1 (P₂ / P₁), we take the reciprocal:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option C.\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3 = (5 / 7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364\n\n<<<C>>>"
