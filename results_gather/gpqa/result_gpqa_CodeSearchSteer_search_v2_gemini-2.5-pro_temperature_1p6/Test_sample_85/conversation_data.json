    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **Reaction A Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Product:** The product is a δ-lactone, which is a six-membered cyclic ester. The chiral center is at the C4 position with an (R) configuration. This product results from the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n*   **Starting Material Candidates:** The options provided are all derivatives of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid, specifically an ester-acid: `Isobutyl-O-C(=O)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`. This molecule has a carboxylic acid group at one end and an isobutyl ester at the other.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group on starting material A to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group will remain unchanged.\n    2.  The resulting molecule is (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n    3.  The subsequent addition of acid (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid to form the δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction B Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Product:** The product is the (S) enantiomer of the lactone from Reaction A. It forms from the lactonization of (S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n*   **Starting Material Candidates:** The starting material B has the same structural formula as A but may differ in stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of starting material B to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group will remain intact.\n    2.  This reduction yields isobutyl (S)-4-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate.\n    3.  The acid workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, cyclizing to form the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As with Reaction A, the reaction sequence does not alter the configuration of the chiral center. The stereochemistry is retained from the starting material to the product.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Because the final product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
