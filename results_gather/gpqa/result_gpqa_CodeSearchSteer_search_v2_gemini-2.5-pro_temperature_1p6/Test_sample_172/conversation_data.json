    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron.\n\nFirst, we will use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle to determine the uncertainty in the electron's momentum. The principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) must be greater than or equal to a constant value. For the minimum uncertainty, we have the relation:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position, given as 0.1 nm (which is 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n*   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\nFrom this, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum:\n\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nNext, we need to find the relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The electron is traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s, while c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s), which means we should consider the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n\nwhere:\n*   E is the total energy.\n*   p is the momentum.\n*   m₀ is the rest mass of the electron (9.11 x 10⁻³¹ kg).\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\nTo find the relationship between the uncertainties, we can differentiate the energy equation with respect to momentum:\n\nd(E²)/dp = d((pc)² + (m₀c²)²)/dp\n2E * dE/dp = 2p * c²\ndE/dp = (pc²) / E\n\nWe also know the relativistic relations for total energy (E = γm₀c²) and momentum (p = γm₀v), where γ is the Lorentz factor. Dividing p by E gives:\n\np / E = (γm₀v) / (γm₀c²) = v / c²\n\nSo, E = pc²/v. Substituting this back into our expression for dE/dp:\n\ndE/dp = (pc²) / (pc²/v) = v\n\nThis gives us a direct relationship between the small changes (uncertainties) in energy and momentum:\n\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\nNow, we can substitute the values we have:\n\nΔE ≈ (2 * 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis value is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is closest to 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<C>>>"
