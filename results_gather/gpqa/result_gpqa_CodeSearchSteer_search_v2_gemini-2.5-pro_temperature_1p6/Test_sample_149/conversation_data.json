    "Here is a step-by-step identification of the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO using the provided 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Unsaturation:** The formula C8H9NO has a degree of unsaturation of 5. This value strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond or ring.\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Its splitting into a triplet indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are classic indicators of a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical of an amino (-NH2) group due to proton exchange.\n\nCombining these pieces of information, the starting compound is identified as **(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, (4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 and 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n    *   The first step involves the reaction of a primary aromatic amine with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) at low temperatures. This is a standard diazotization reaction that converts the amino group (-NH2) into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The subsequent addition of water (H2O), typically with gentle heating, hydrolyzes the diazonium salt. This process replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas.\n    *   The intermediate product after these two steps is **(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The intermediate, (4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, is an aldehyde with protons on its α-carbon (the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base like potassium hydroxide (KOH) and heat, it undergoes a self-condensation reaction.\n    *   This reaction is an **aldol condensation**. One molecule of the aldehyde forms an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n    *   Initially, an aldol addition product, a β-hydroxy aldehyde, is formed.\n    *   With the application of heat, this intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to yield a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is highly conjugated, which provides a strong thermodynamic driving force for the dehydration step.\n\n### **Step 3: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe self-aldol condensation of two molecules of (4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. Subsequent dehydration leads to the final product.\n\nThe resulting structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This compound has been synthesized and characterized in scientific literature.\n\nComparing this derived structure to the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal is the aldol *addition* product, before the final dehydration step.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal has an incorrect structure.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal has incorrect substituents and double bond placement.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal correctly matches the expected product from the complete aldol condensation reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
