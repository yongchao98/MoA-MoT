    "To determine the interaction between genes G1, G2, and G3, let's analyze the experimental results step-by-step.\n\n### Data Analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the single mutants:**\n    *   Wild-type (Control) plants have 100% resistance.\n    *   **g1 mutant (G1 knocked out):** 75% resistance. This means the G1 gene product contributes to resistance, but is not essential on its own. The remaining 75% resistance is provided by other genes (like G3).\n    *   **g2 mutant (G2 knocked out):** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 completely eliminates resistance. This indicates G2 plays a critical, indispensable role in the resistance pathway.\n    *   **g3 mutant (G3 knocked out):** 50% resistance. The G3 gene product contributes significantly to resistance. The remaining 50% is provided by other genes (like G1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the double mutants to understand epistasis:**\n    *   **Epistasis** is a phenomenon where the effect of one gene masks the effect of another gene. In a regulatory pathway, an upstream gene is often epistatic to a downstream gene. If the double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that single mutant's gene is epistatic.\n    *   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g1` mutant (75% resistance). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G1.\n    *   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g3` mutant (50% resistance). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This suggests G2 also acts upstream of G3.\n    *   **Conclusion about G2:** Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and its knockout abolishes the function, it is very likely the upstream **transcription factor** that is required to activate both G1 and G3.\n\n3.  **Analyze the G1 and G3 interaction:**\n    *   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance. This phenotype is different and more severe than either single mutant (`g1` is 75%, `g3` is 50%).\n    *   Since the double mutant phenotype is not the same as either single mutant's phenotype, there is **no epistasis** between G1 and G3. They likely function in parallel pathways downstream of G2, and their effects are at least partially additive or synergistic.\n    *   The term **pleiotropy** refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits; we are only observing one trait (resistance), so this term is not appropriate here.\n    *   The term **gene redundancy** implies that two genes perform a similar function, so the loss of one can be compensated by the other. The severe effect in the double mutant compared to the single mutants is a characteristic of a redundant system (sometimes called partial redundancy). While the single mutants do have a noticeable phenotype, \"redundancy\" is a more plausible description of their parallel roles than epistasis or pleiotropy.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. The data shows no epistasis between G1 and G3.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is incorrect. The data shows no epistasis between G1 and G3.\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. G2, not G1, is the transcription factor because it is epistatic to the others.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is incorrect. It misidentifies the G1-G3 interaction as both pleiotropy and epistasis.\n\nIt appears there is a significant flaw in the question's options, as all of them contain statements that contradict the data. Specifically, options A, B, and D all incorrectly claim epistasis exists between G1 and G3.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best fit\" by identifying the most accurate components, we can re-evaluate. The most certain conclusions are that G2 is an upstream transcription factor and that G1 and G3 act in parallel with a synergistic/redundant relationship. No option correctly captures all these points.\n\nThere might be an error in the question itself, specifically in describing the interaction between G1 and G3. Let's reconsider option C: \"**G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\". While \"G1 is a transcription factor\" is the wrong conclusion, this is the only option that correctly identifies an epistatic relationship that is actually present in the data (\"G2 is epistatic towards G1\"). All other options describe an epistatic relationship between G1 and G3 which is demonstrably false. Given the high likelihood of errors in the construction of the question, the option containing the only verifiable true statement about epistasis might be the intended answer, despite its other flaws.\n\nLet's re-examine our initial analysis.\n- G2 is epistatic to G1. (Correct, found in option C)\n- G2 is epistatic to G3. (Correct, not found in any option)\n- G1 and G3 have a synergistic/redundant relationship. (Termed \"redundancy\" in B, \"pleiotropy\" in C/D). Redundancy is a better fit than pleiotropy.\n- G2 is the transcription factor. (Stated in A, B, D).\n\nNo option is fully correct. But Option C contains a verifiably correct statement (\"G2 is epistatic towards G1\") which no other option does. All other options are verifiably false in their epistasis claims. Therefore, despite its own inaccuracies, C might be considered the intended answer in a flawed question.\n\nHowever, let's step back and assume there's a mistake in the prompt's `g1g3` value and that epistasis *was* intended. This is speculation. We must work with the numbers given.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies, let's focus on the most important gene, G2. G2 knockout leads to 0% resistance. G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. This makes G2 the master regulator, a transcription factor. This eliminates option C which states G1 is the transcription factor. Now we are left with A, B, and D. All three correctly identify G2 as the TF but incorrectly describe the G1-G3 relationship. There is no logical path to a single correct answer among the choices.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in option C, and it should have said \"G2 is a transcription factor\". In that case it would be: \"G2 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\". This would be a much stronger option, although \"pleiotropy\" is still likely incorrect.\n\nGiven the severe logical flaws in all provided options when compared against the data, a definitive choice cannot be made. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question that is likely flawed, one must find the \"best\" possible answer. Let's reconsider the entire framework.\n\nThe epistasis of G2 over G1 and G3 is the strongest piece of evidence, pointing to G2 being an upstream transcription factor. This points towards A, B, or D. All of these misrepresent the G1/G3 interaction. Comparing the misrepresentations, \"gene redundancy\" (Option B) is a more plausible, albeit imperfect, description of two genes acting in parallel for one function than \"pleiotropy\" is. However, the epistasis part of B (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is definitively wrong.\n\nLet's assume the entire question is flawed and try to find an alternative interpretation. What if G1 is epistatic to G3, as stated in option B and D (reversed in A)? That would mean g1g3 = 75%. The data says 10%. This is not a small discrepancy.\n\nLet's return to the most likely pathway: G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, which act in parallel. This makes \"G2 is a transcription factor\" the most critical correct statement. This leaves A, B, and D. All three have a fatal flaw in the epistasis claim for G1/G3. Let's re-evaluate \"gene redundancy\" vs \"same promoter\". We cannot prove they have the same promoter. \"Gene redundancy\" is a functional description that partially fits the observation that losing both G1 and G3 is much worse than losing one. This might make B the 'least wrong' choice, if one ignores the incorrect epistasis claim.\n\nThere is no logically sound answer. I will highlight the analysis that shows G2 is a transcription factor and is epistatic to G1 and G3. The G1 and G3 interaction is synergistic. No option reflects this correctly. However, let's assume the question expects us to identify G2 as the TF and pick the most plausible description for G1/G3, while ignoring the incorrect epistasis clause. Between redundancy, pleiotropy, and same promoter, redundancy is the most fitting functional description for the G1/G3 interaction.\n\nFinal attempt at synthesis:\n1.  **G2 is TF?** Yes. (Rules out C).\n2.  **G1/G3 interaction?** Synergistic. \"Redundancy\" (B) is a better fit than \"pleiotropy\" (D) or \"same promoter\" (A, which is a hypothesis about mechanism, not function). This favors B.\n3.  **Epistasis?** B says \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". This is wrong.\n\nLet's pick the option with the most correct elements. B correctly identifies G2 as a TF and uses a plausible (though imperfect) term for the G1/G3 interaction. Its final clause is incorrect. A also gets the TF right, but the \"same promoter\" is pure speculation and its final clause is also incorrect. D gets the TF right, but \"pleiotropy\" is wrong, and its final clause is wrong. Option B seems to have two-thirds of its statements as plausible/correct, which is better than the others.\n\n<<<B>>>"
