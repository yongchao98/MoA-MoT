The energy of a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is:\n    $E_{v,J} = (v + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B J(J+1)$\n    where $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$ is the rotational constant, and $I$ is the moment of inertia.\n\n2.  **Determine the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the minimum quantum numbers: `v=0` and `J=0`.\n    *   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon to transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This transition must be allowed by spectroscopic selection rules. For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules for rovibrational absorption are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n    *   Starting from the initial state `J=0`, a transition with `ΔJ = -1` is impossible. Therefore, the only allowed rotational change is `ΔJ = +1`.\n    *   Combining the rules, the transition must be from the initial state `(v=0, J=0)` to the final state `(v=1, J=1)`. This is the lowest-energy rovibrational transition allowed by photon absorption from the ground state.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n    The energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{0,0} = (0 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B(0)(1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   $E_{final} = E_{1,1} = (1 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B(1)(2) = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n    *   $\\Delta E = E_{final} - E_{initial} = (\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B) - (\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega) = \\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n    *   Substituting $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$, the energy becomes $\\Delta E = \\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Necessary Physical Quantities:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        $M_x = 20$ amu, $M_y = 2$ amu.

This requires applying the selection rules (`Δv=+1, ΔJ=±1`), which leads to the final state `(v=1, J=1)`. A simple interpretation of the absolute next energy level `(v=0, J=1)` would lead to a much smaller energy and momentum, inconsistent with the options.\n*   **Energy Formula:** The correct transition energy is `ΔE = ħω + 2B`, not just `ħω`. While the rotational term `2B` is small, it is part of the model.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** All values (amu, angstroms) must be converted to SI units (kg, m) for the calculation.\n*   **Matching Result to Option:** A significant number of the provided candidate answers calculated the correct numerical value but then matched it to the wrong lettered option, often due to re-ordering the options in their own text.

The energy of any given state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J`, is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    `E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B*J(J+1)`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration, and `B` is the rotational constant (`B = ħ² / 2I`).\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial and Final States (Crucial Point):**\n    *   **Initial State:** The molecule starts in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the minimum quantum numbers: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon to transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This transition must be allowed by quantum mechanical selection rules. For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule absorbing a photon, the rovibrational selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n    *   Starting from the initial state `J=0`, a transition with `ΔJ = -1` is impossible. Therefore, the only allowed rotational change is `ΔJ = +1`.\n    *   Combining these rules, the transition from the ground state must be to the state where `v = 1` and `J = 1`. This is the lowest-energy rovibrational transition allowed by photon absorption.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon (ΔE):**\n    The photon's energy must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    *   `E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω`\n    *   `E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B*1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n    *   `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + 2B`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Necessary Physical Quantities:**\n    To find `ΔE`, we must first calculate the rotational constant `B`, which requires the moment of inertia `I` and the reduced mass `μ`. All units must be converted to SI.\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        *   Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu\n        *   1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n        *   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\n        *   μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        *   R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n        *   I = μ * R² ≈ (3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n        *   I ≈ 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n    *   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n        *   ħ ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   B = ħ² / (2I) ≈ (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴)² / (2 * 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶) ≈ 4.604 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n    *   Vibrational Energy Term (ħω): (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    *   Rotational Energy Term (2B): 2 * (4.604 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 9.208 x 10⁻²³ J\n    *   ΔE = (4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.208 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n6.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p):**\n    The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by the formula `p = E / c`.\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   p = ΔE / c ≈ (4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated momentum, `p ≈ 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`, is closest to the value given in option B.\n\n### Careful Points Summarized:\n*   **Model Interpretation:** Correctly use the energy formula for the non-rigid rotor model.\n*   **Selection Rules:** The most critical step is realizing the transition is governed by photon absorption selection rules (`Δv = +1, ΔJ = +1`), which dictates the final state is `(v=1, J=1)`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Ensure all given values (amu, angstroms) are converted to standard SI units (kg, m) before calculation.\n*   **Calculation Steps:** The calculation must proceed logically from reduced mass to moment of inertia, then to the energy terms, and finally to momentum.\n*   **Final Conversion:** Remember to convert the final calculated energy change (`ΔE`) into momentum (`p = ΔE / c`).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by first correctly identifying the quantum transition and then calculating the required energy and momentum.\n\n1.  **Identify the Model and Energy Levels**: The problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy of a state (v, J) is given by $E_{v,J} = (v + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B J(J+1)$, where B is the rotational constant.\n2.  **Determine the Transition**: The molecule starts in the fundamental (ground) state, which is (v=0, J=0). The transition is caused by photon absorption, so it must follow the selection rules for a heteronuclear diatomic molecule: $\\Delta v = +1$ and $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$. Starting from J=0, only $\\Delta J = +1$ is possible. Therefore, the transition is from the initial state (v=0, J=0) to the final state (v=1, J=1).\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**: The energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{0,0} = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   $E_{final} = E_{1,1} = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n    *   $\\Delta E = E_{final} - E_{initial} = \\hbar\\omega + 2B$. Since $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$, this is equivalent to $\\Delta E = \\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$.\n4.  **Calculate Photon Momentum ($p$)**: The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by the equation $p = \\frac{\\Delta E}{c}$.\n5.  **Execute Calculation**: I will write a Python script to compute the necessary physical quantities (reduced mass $\\mu$, moment of inertia $I$) and then calculate the final momentum $p$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Interpreting the Transition**: The most critical step is understanding that \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" refers to the state reachable via photon absorption, which is governed by selection rules, not just the next sequential energy level.\n*   **Unit Consistency**: All given values (amu, angstroms) must be converted to standard SI units (kg, m) before being used in the formulas.\n*   **Complete Energy Formula**: The transition energy includes both a vibrational term ($\\hbar\\omega$) and a rotational term ($2B$ or $\\hbar^2/I$).\n*   **Energy to Momentum Conversion**: The final step is to correctly convert the calculated energy difference into momentum using the speed of light, $c$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_photon_momentum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the momentum of a photon required for a specific molecular transition.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Physical Constants ---\n    h_bar = 1.05457e-34  # Reduced Planck constant (J*s)\n    c = 2.9979e8       # Speed of light (m/s)\n    amu_to_kg = 1.66054e-27 # Conversion factor from amu to kg\n\n    # --- Given Parameters ---\n    Mx_amu = 20.0  # Mass of atom X in amu\n    My_amu = 2.0   # Mass of atom Y in amu\n    R_angstrom = 2.0 # Molecular bond length in angstroms\n    omega = 4.0e14   # Angular frequency of vibration in rad/s\n\n    # --- Step 1: Convert units to SI ---\n    Mx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\n    My_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\n    R_m = R_angstrom * 1e-10\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Reduced Mass (mu) ---\n    # The reduced mass for a diatomic molecule is mu = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2)\n    mu = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate Moment of Inertia (I) ---\n    # The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = mu * R^2\n    I = mu * R_m**2\n\n    # --- Step 4: Calculate the energy difference (Delta E) for the transition ---\n    # The transition is from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited\n    # rovibrational state allowed by selection rules (v=1, J=1).\n    # Delta E = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = (h_bar * omega) + (h_bar^2 / I)\n    E_vib_term = h_bar * omega\n    E_rot_term = (h_bar**2) / I\n    delta_E = E_vib_term + E_rot_term\n\n    # --- Step 5: Calculate the photon's momentum (p) ---\n    # The momentum of a photon is p = E / c\n    p = delta_E / c\n\n    # --- Output the final result and compare with options ---\n    print(f\"The calculated momentum is: {p:.3e} N*s\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing with the given options:\")\n    print(f\"A) p = 1.4e-28 N*s\")\n    print(f\"B) p = 2.3e-27 N*s\")\n    print(f\"C) p = 1.1e-27 N*s\")\n    print(f\"D) p = 1.9e-28 N*s\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option A.\")\n\nsolve_photon_momentum()\n\n<<<A>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 54\n    <<<A>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Model and Energy Levels:**\n    The problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule.

Identifying the Transition\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers: **(v=0, J=0)**.\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon, causing a transition. For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the spectroscopic selection rules for such a transition are **Δv = +1** and **ΔJ = ±1**.\n*   Starting from J=0, a transition with ΔJ=-1 is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed transition from the ground state is to the state where **v=1** and **J=1**.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states:\n*   $E_{initial} = E_{0,0} = \\hbar\\omega(\\frac{1}{2}) + B(0)(1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   $E_{final} = E_{1,1} = \\hbar\\omega(\\frac{3}{2}) + B(1)(2) = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n*   $\\Delta E = E_{final} - E_{initial} = (\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B) - (\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega) = \\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Photon's Momentum (p)\nThe momentum of a photon is related to its energy by the equation $p = \\frac{\\Delta E}{c}$, where `c` is the speed of light.\n$p = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega + 2B}{c}$\n\nTo find the numerical value, we will use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Physical constants\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\nc = 299792458.0          # Speed of light in m/s\namu_to_kg = 1.66053906660e-27 # Conversion factor from amu to kg\n\n# Given parameters from the problem\nMx_amu = 20.0\nMy_amu = 2.0\nR_angstrom = 2.0\nomega = 4.0e14 # rad/s\n\n# Convert parameters to SI units\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nR_m = R_angstrom * 1e-10\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the reduced mass (mu)\nmu = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu * R_m**2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the rotational constant (B)\nB = (h_bar**2) / (2 * I)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the transition energy (Delta E)\ndelta_E = (h_bar * omega) + (2 * B)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the photon's momentum (p)\np = delta_E / c\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"{p:.3e}\")\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 1.410e-28\n\nErrors: \n\nThe calculated momentum is **1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) p = 1.1 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\nB) p = 1.9 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\nC) p = 1.4 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\nD) p = 2.3 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 1.410e-28\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on the step-by-step analysis and the code execution, the calculated momentum of the photon is:\n\n$p \\approx 1.410 \\times 10^{-28}$ N·s\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) p = 1.9 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\nB) p = 2.3 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\nC) p = 1.4 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\nD) p = 1.1 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the final answer, I will analyze the problem step-by-step, drawing upon the consensus methodology from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the critical points of the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Model and Energy Levels**\nThe problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule. The energy of a specific state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J`, is given by:\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J + 1)\nwhere `B = ħ² / (2I)` is the rotational constant, `I` is the moment of inertia, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, and `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n\n**2. Determine the Initial and Final States**\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the minimum quantum numbers: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon to transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This transition must obey the spectroscopic selection rules for a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, which are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n*   Starting from the initial state `(v=0, J=0)`, the only allowed transition is to `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = +1` (since J cannot be negative). Therefore, the final state is `v = 1` and `J = 1`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon (ΔE)**\nThe photon's energy must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(2) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω] = **ħω + 2B**\n\nSubstituting `B = ħ² / (2I)`, the energy change is `ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Necessary Physical Quantities**\nFirst, we calculate the reduced mass (μ) and the moment of inertia (I).\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mₓ * Mᵧ) / (Mₓ + Mᵧ) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu.\n    Using the conversion 1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg:\n    μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ **3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg**.\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR²\n    Using R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m:\n    I ≈ (3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² ≈ **1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Transition Energy (ΔE)**\nNow we calculate the two components of the energy change.\n*   **Vibrational Energy Part (ħω):**\n    Using ħ ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s and ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s:\n    ħω ≈ (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴) * (4 x 10¹⁴) ≈ **4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J**.\n*   **Rotational Energy Part (2B or ħ²/I):**\n    ħ²/I ≈ (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴)² / (1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶) ≈ **9.208 x 10⁻²³ J**.\n*   **Total Energy (ΔE):**\n    ΔE ≈ (4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.208 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ **4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J**.\n\n**6. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)**\nThe momentum of a photon is related to its energy by `p = ΔE / c`.\n*   Using c ≈ 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s:\n    p ≈ (4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ **1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**.\n\n**7. Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculated momentum is `p ≈ 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s\nB) p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s\nC) p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s\nD) p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Interpreting the Transition:** The most critical step is understanding that the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" is determined by the physical process of photon absorption and its associated selection rules (`Δv = +1`, `ΔJ = +1`), not simply the next energy level in a theoretical diagram. This correctly identifies the final state as (v=1, J=1).\n2.  **Unit Consistency:** All calculations must be performed in SI units. This requires converting the atomic masses from amu to kg and the bond length from angstroms to meters.\n3.  **Correct Energy Formula:** The energy of the transition is the sum of the vibrational energy change (`ħω`) and the rotational energy change (`2B` or `ħ²/I`).\n4.  **Energy to Momentum Conversion:** The final step requires converting the calculated energy `ΔE` to momentum `p` using the correct relation for a photon, `p = ΔE / c`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem and Methodology\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the momentum of a photon that excites a diatomic molecule from its ground state to the next allowed energy state. The solution requires a clear understanding of the quantum rotation-vibration model, spectroscopic selection rules, and the relationship between a photon's energy and momentum.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Energy Model and Initial State**\nThe problem specifies the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy of a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and rotational quantum number `J` is:\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J + 1)\nwhere B = ħ² / (2I) is the rotational constant.\n\nThe \"fundamental state\" is the ground state, which has the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the minimum quantum numbers, `v = 0` and `J = 0`. This point was correctly identified by all candidate answers that provided detailed reasoning.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Final State (Crucial Point)**\nThe molecule absorbs a photon to transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This phrasing requires careful interpretation. A transition must be allowed by quantum mechanical selection rules. For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule absorbing a photon, the rovibrational selection rules are:\nΔv = +1\nΔJ = ±1\n\nStarting from the initial state (v=0, J=0), a change of ΔJ = -1 is impossible as J cannot be negative. Therefore, the only allowed transition is ΔJ = +1. This leads to the final state being (v=1, J=1). Most of the detailed answers correctly identified this as the key to solving the problem, dismissing a pure rotational transition (to v=0, J=1) based on the context and the magnitude of the options.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)**\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = ( (3/2)ħω + 2B ) - ( (1/2)ħω ) = **ħω + 2B**\n\nThis formula was correctly derived in all successful candidate solutions.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Numerical Calculation**\nThis step involves calculating the reduced mass (μ), the moment of inertia (I), the transition energy (ΔE), and finally the momentum (p).\n\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Speed of light (c) ≈ 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Atomic mass unit (amu) ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Calculations:**\n    1.  **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        μ = (Mₓ * Mᵧ) / (Mₓ + Mᵧ) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\n        μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ **3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg**\n\n    2.  **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        I = μR² = (3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² ≈ **1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²**\n\n    3.  **Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n        ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n        ΔE ≈ (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ * 4 x 10¹⁴) + ( (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴)² / 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ )\n        ΔE ≈ (4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.208 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ **4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J**\n\n    4.  **Photon Momentum (p):**\n        p = ΔE / c ≈ (4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ **1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a momentum of approximately **1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**. Comparing this value to the provided options:\n*   A) p = 1.9 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n*   B) p = 1.4 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n*   C) p = 2.3 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\n*   D) p = 1.1 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option B. Many of the candidate answers arrived at the correct numerical result but made errors in matching it to the correct letter option due to inconsistent labeling in their own analysis. However, the underlying physics and calculation point decisively to one value.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the momentum of a photon that excites a diatomic molecule from its ground state to the next allowed energy state within the rotation-vibration model.\n\n### Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct Physical Model and Energy Levels:**\n    The problem specifies the quantum rotation-vibration model.

The energy of a state is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n$E_{v,J} = \\hbar\\omega(v + \\frac{1}{2}) + B J(J+1)$\nwhere:\n*   `v` and `J` are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$, where `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers: **(v=0, J=0)**.\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon, causing a transition. For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the spectroscopic selection rules for such a transition are **Δv = +1** and **ΔJ = ±1**.\n*   Starting from J=0, a transition with ΔJ=-1 is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed transition from the ground state is to the state where **v=1** and **J=1**.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states:\n*   $E_{initial} = E_{0,0} = \\hbar\\omega(\\frac{1}{2}) + B(0)(1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   $E_{final} = E_{1,1} = \\hbar\\omega(\\frac{3}{2}) + B(1)(2) = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n*   $\\Delta E = E_{final} - E_{initial} = (\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B) - (\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega) = \\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n\n### 4.

Identify the Model and Energy Levels**\nThe problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule. The energy of a specific state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J`, is given by:\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J + 1)\nwhere `B = ħ² / (2I)` is the rotational constant, `I` is the moment of inertia, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, and `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n\n**2. Determine the Initial and Final States**\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the minimum quantum numbers: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon to transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This transition must obey the spectroscopic selection rules for a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, which are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n*   Starting from the initial state `(v=0, J=0)`, the only allowed transition is to `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = +1` (since J cannot be negative). Therefore, the final state is `v = 1` and `J = 1`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon (ΔE)**\nThe photon's energy must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(2) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω] = **ħω + 2B**\n\nSubstituting `B = ħ² / (2I)`, the energy change is `ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Necessary Physical Quantities**\nFirst, we calculate the reduced mass (μ) and the moment of inertia (I).\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mₓ * Mᵧ) / (Mₓ + Mᵧ) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu.\n    Using the conversion 1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg:\n    μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ **3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg**.\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR²\n    Using R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m:\n    I ≈ (3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² ≈ **1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Transition Energy (ΔE)**\nNow we calculate the two components of the energy change.\n*   **Vibrational Energy Part (ħω):**\n    Using ħ ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s and ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s:\n    ħω ≈ (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴) * (4 x 10¹⁴) ≈ **4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J**.\n*   **Rotational Energy Part (2B or ħ²/I):**\n    ħ²/I ≈ (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴)² / (1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶) ≈ **9.208 x 10⁻²³ J**.\n*   **Total Energy (ΔE):**\n    ΔE ≈ (4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.208 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ **4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J**.\n\n**6. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)**\nThe momentum of a photon is related to its energy by `p = ΔE / c`.\n*   Using c ≈ 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s:\n    p ≈ (4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ **1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**.\n\n**7. Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculated momentum is `p ≈ 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s\nB) p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s\nC) p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s\nD) p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Interpreting the Transition:** The most critical step is understanding that the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" is determined by the physical process of photon absorption and its associated selection rules (`Δv = +1`, `ΔJ = +1`), not simply the next energy level in a theoretical diagram. This correctly identifies the final state as (v=1, J=1).\n2.  **Unit Consistency:** All calculations must be performed in SI units. This requires converting the atomic masses from amu to kg and the bond length from angstroms to meters.\n3.  **Correct Energy Formula:** The energy of the transition is the sum of the vibrational energy change (`ħω`) and the rotational energy change (`2B` or `ħ²/I`).\n4.  **Energy to Momentum Conversion:** The final step requires converting the calculated energy `ΔE` to momentum `p` using the correct relation for a photon, `p = ΔE / c`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem and Methodology\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the momentum of a photon that excites a diatomic molecule from its ground state to the next allowed energy state. The solution requires a clear understanding of the quantum rotation-vibration model, spectroscopic selection rules, and the relationship between a photon's energy and momentum.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Energy Model and Initial State**\nThe problem specifies the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy of a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and rotational quantum number `J` is:\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J + 1)\nwhere B = ħ² / (2I) is the rotational constant.\n\nThe \"fundamental state\" is the ground state, which has the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the minimum quantum numbers, `v = 0` and `J = 0`. This point was correctly identified by all candidate answers that provided detailed reasoning.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Final State (Crucial Point)**\nThe molecule absorbs a photon to transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This phrasing requires careful interpretation. A transition must be allowed by quantum mechanical selection rules. For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule absorbing a photon, the rovibrational selection rules are:\nΔv = +1\nΔJ = ±1\n\nStarting from the initial state (v=0, J=0), a change of ΔJ = -1 is impossible as J cannot be negative. Therefore, the only allowed transition is ΔJ = +1. This leads to the final state being (v=1, J=1). Most of the detailed answers correctly identified this as the key to solving the problem, dismissing a pure rotational transition (to v=0, J=1) based on the context and the magnitude of the options.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)**\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = ( (3/2)ħω + 2B ) - ( (1/2)ħω ) = **ħω + 2B**\n\nThis formula was correctly derived in all successful candidate solutions.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Numerical Calculation**\nThis step involves calculating the reduced mass (μ), the moment of inertia (I), the transition energy (ΔE), and finally the momentum (p).\n\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Speed of light (c) ≈ 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Atomic mass unit (amu) ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Calculations:**\n    1.  **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        μ = (Mₓ * Mᵧ) / (Mₓ + Mᵧ) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\n        μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ **3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg**\n\n    2.  **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        I = μR² = (3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² ≈ **1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²**\n\n    3.  **Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n        ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n        ΔE ≈ (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ * 4 x 10¹⁴) + ( (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴)² / 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ )\n        ΔE ≈ (4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.208 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ **4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J**\n\n    4.  **Photon Momentum (p):**\n        p = ΔE / c ≈ (4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ **1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a momentum of approximately **1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**. Comparing this value to the provided options:\n*   A) p = 1.9 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n*   B) p = 1.4 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n*   C) p = 2.3 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\n*   D) p = 1.1 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option B. Many of the candidate answers arrived at the correct numerical result but made errors in matching it to the correct letter option due to inconsistent labeling in their own analysis. However, the underlying physics and calculation point decisively to one value.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the momentum of a photon that excites a diatomic molecule from its ground state to the next allowed energy state within the rotation-vibration model.\n\n### Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct Physical Model and Energy Levels:**\n    The problem specifies the quantum rotation-vibration model.
