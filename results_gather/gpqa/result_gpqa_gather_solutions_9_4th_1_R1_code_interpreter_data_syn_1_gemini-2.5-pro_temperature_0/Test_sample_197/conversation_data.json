Objective**\nThe primary goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species present in the solution.\n\n**2. Governing Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex in a solution with multiple competing equilibria is determined by its mole fraction (αₙ) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2) is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. The correct formula, which all candidate answers unanimously agree upon, is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Calculation**\nWe substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\n*   **Numerator Calculation:** The term corresponding to the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation:** The sum of the terms for all possible cobalt species.\n    *   Term for free Co²⁺ (n=0, β₀=1): 1\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   **Sum of Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Percentage Calculation:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. A critical and valid assumption, made by all agents, is that the free thiocyanate concentration is approximately equal to its total concentration (`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`). This is justified because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), so only a small fraction of the ligand is consumed.\n2.  **Role of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. The percentage distribution of species is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions. The `c(Co)` value is primarily used to justify the ligand concentration approximation mentioned above.\n3.  **Formula Integrity**: It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions (where β₀ is defined as 1) and is essential for calculating the correct total concentration of all cobalt species.\n4.  **Reconciling Candidate Answers**: There is a complete consensus among all 15 candidate answers on the calculation method and the final numerical result of ~16.9%. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, shuffled order to each agent. The chemical and mathematical reasoning is sound and consistent across all answers.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of **16.9%**.

Governing Formula**\nThe distribution of complex species in an equilibrium system is determined by the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (β). The percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (α) and multiplying by 100. For the dithiocyanato complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2), the mole fraction (α₂) is given by the following standard formula, which was unanimously and correctly used by all candidate answers:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3.

The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in a tenfold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration. Therefore, we will use `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation itself. The percentage distribution of species is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions.

The problem provides the *total* concentration, 0.1 M. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (ten times greater) compared to the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt is relatively small. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n2.  **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out during the derivation of the formula. The value is primarily used to justify the ligand concentration approximation mentioned above.\n3.  **The '1' in the Denominator:** The denominator must include the term '1' (where β₀ = 1) to account for the fraction of free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions. This is a crucial part of the formula and was correctly included in all candidate answers.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Step-by-Step Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator of the α₂ fraction:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nCalculate the mole fraction α₂:\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**Step 5: Match Result to Options**\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%.

Objective**\nThe primary goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species present in the solution.\n\n**2. Governing Formula**\nThe distribution of complex species in a solution is determined by the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (β). The percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (α) and multiplying by 100. For the dithiocyanato complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2), the mole fraction α₂ is given by the standard formula:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified and used this formula, indicating a strong consensus on the correct theoretical approach.\n\n**3. Calculation**\nThe next step is to substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   Concentration of thiocyanate, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constant β₁ = 9\n*   Stability constant β₂ = 40\n*   Stability constant β₃ = 63\n*   Stability constant β₄ = 16\n\n*   **Numerator Calculation:**\n    The term for the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is:\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation:**\n    The denominator is the sum of the terms for all possible cobalt species, including the free ion.\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0, where β₀=1): 1\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   **Sum of Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Percentage Calculation:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a result of 16.9%.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. It is a standard and valid chemical approximation to use the total concentration because the ligand (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the metal ion (0.01 M). Therefore, the amount of ligand consumed to form complexes is negligible.\n2.  **Role of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not used directly in the percentage calculation. Its value is primarily important for justifying the approximation of the free ligand concentration mentioned in the point above.\n3.  **Formula Integrity**: It is crucial that the denominator includes the term '1'. This term represents the fraction of uncomplexed, free Co²⁺ ions (where β₀ = 1) and must be included in the sum of all species to get the correct total.\n4.  **Consensus on Calculation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 16.9%. The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different order for each agent. The calculation itself is not in dispute.\n5.  **Matching Result to Options**: The final step is to match the calculated value (16.9%) to the specific options provided in the question. The options are A) 42.3%, B) 38.1%, C) 16.9%, and D) 25.6%.

For the complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the mole fraction (α₂) is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. The correct formula, which all candidate answers agree upon, is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Calculation**: The calculation proceeds by substituting the given values into the formula:\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    *   **Numerator Calculation**: The term for the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is:\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator Calculation**: The denominator is the sum of the terms for all possible cobalt species.\n        *   Term for free Co²⁺ (n=0, β₀=1): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation**: The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is the ratio of its term to the sum of all terms.\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Percentage Calculation**: To get the final percentage, the mole fraction is multiplied by 100.\n        Percentage = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The calculation requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. A critical and valid assumption, made by all candidate answers, is that the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` is approximately equal to its total concentration (0.1 M). This is justified because the total ligand concentration is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal ion concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`).\n*   **Independence from Total Metal Concentration**: The *percentage* distribution of the various complex species is independent of the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`. The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula. The `c(Co)` value is only needed to justify the assumption about the free ligand concentration.\n*   **Formula Integrity**: It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term represents the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions (where β₀ = 1) and is essential for calculating the correct total concentration of all cobalt species.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation**: All candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 16.9%.

Governing Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction for the nth complex, αₙ, is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`. For the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), the formula is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[L]²) / (1 + β₁[L]¹ + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴)\n\nThis formula is standard for such calculations and was correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n\n**3. Careful Points and Assumptions**\nA thorough analysis reveals several critical points that were correctly handled by the candidate answers:\n\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. The problem provides the *total* thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). Since the total ligand concentration is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal concentration (10⁻² M), it is a valid and standard chemical approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. Therefore, `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not used directly in the mole fraction calculation. The percentage distribution of the various complex species is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions. The `c(Co)` value is primarily used to justify the assumption about the free ligand concentration.\n*   **Formula Integrity**: The denominator must include the term '1', which represents the fraction of the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ion (where β₀ = 1). This is essential for accounting for all cobalt-containing species and was correctly included in all calculations.\n\n**4. Calculation**\nThe calculation is performed by substituting the given values into the formula:\n*   **Given Values**:\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n*   **Numerator Calculation**:\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation**:\n    The denominator is the sum of terms for all species from the free ion (n=0) to the final complex (n=4).\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   **Sum of Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation**:\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Percentage Calculation**:\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of approximately **16.9%**. All candidate answers correctly performed this calculation, indicating a strong consensus on the method and numerical result.

Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to the total ligand concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.

The problem provides the *total* concentration, 0.1 M. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (ten times greater) compared to the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt is relatively small. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n2.  **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation.

Calculation:**\nThe calculation proceeds by substituting the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\n*   **Numerator Calculation:**\n    The term for the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is:\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation:**\n    The denominator is the sum of the terms for all possible cobalt species, including the free ion.\n    *   Term for free Co²⁺ (n=0, where β₀=1): **1**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × 0.1² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × 0.1³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × 0.1⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n    Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Percentage Calculation:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. A critical and valid assumption is that the free thiocyanate concentration is approximately equal to its total concentration (`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`). This is justified because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), so only a small fraction of the ligand is consumed.\n2.  **Role of Total Metal Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. Its value is primarily used to justify the assumption about the free ligand concentration. The *percentage* distribution of complexes is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions.\n3.  **Inclusion of the Free Ion:** It is crucial that the denominator includes the term '1', which accounts for the fraction of uncomplexed, free `Co²⁺` ions (where β₀ = 1). This was handled correctly in all candidate answers.\n4.  **Consensus on Calculation:** All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 16.9%. This provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the calculation itself.\n5.  **Matching Result to Options:** The primary source of discrepancy among the candidate answers was matching the calculated value (16.9%) to the correct lettered option, likely because the options were presented in a different order to each agent.

Governing Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction for the nth complex, αₙ, is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`. For the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), the formula is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[L]²) / (1 + β₁[L]¹ + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴)\n\nThis formula is standard for such calculations and was correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n\n**3. Careful Points and Assumptions**\nA thorough analysis reveals several critical points that were correctly handled by the candidate answers:\n\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. The problem provides the *total* thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). Since the total ligand concentration is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal concentration (10⁻² M), it is a valid and standard chemical approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. Therefore, `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not used directly in the mole fraction calculation. The percentage distribution of the various complex species is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions.
