The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents at opposite ends (para). One is a -COOH group, and the other is an alkyl group.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Alkyl Group Structure Determination**\n    The remaining signals must be pieced together to identify the structure of the alkyl group.\n    *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n    *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for two protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for one proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield chemical shift indicates it is benzylic (directly attached to the aromatic ring).\n    *   Assembling these fragments gives the structure: Ring-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. This is a **sec-butyl group**. It is crucial not to confuse this with an isobutyl group, which would have a different NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Combining all the evidence, the starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThis step requires knowledge of the specified chemical reaction.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reaction Analysis**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Function:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is one of the few reagent systems that can completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way to a **methyl group (-CH₃)**.\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group. The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and remain unchanged.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision**\n\nThe final step is to match the identified product with the provided multiple-choice options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Matching the Product to the Options**\n    The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**. We must now compare this to the given choices:\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has the incorrect alkyl isomer. The NMR data confirmed a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group.\n    *   C) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This perfectly matches the name of the predicted final product.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is an entirely different and incorrect structure.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a two-step analysis: first, to identify the starting material (Compound X) from its spectroscopic data, and second, to determine the final product after its reaction with red phosphorus and HI.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThis step involves a detailed analysis of the provided IR and ¹H NMR data. All candidate answers reached a unanimous and correct conclusion about the structure of Compound X.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: IR Spectrum Analysis.** The IR data provides crucial information about the functional groups present.\n    *   The very broad absorption in the **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** range is a definitive signature of the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid, likely conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of C=C bonds within an **aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis.** The NMR data allows for the complete assembly of the molecule's structure.\n    *   The broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The two doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** are a hallmark pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, which causes them to be shifted further downfield.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Alkyl Group Structure Determination.** The remaining signals must be pieced together to identify the second substituent. It is critical to distinguish between structural isomers.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons is the methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton is the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is benzylic (directly attached to the aromatic ring).\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Assembling the Structure of Compound X.** Assembling these fragments [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)] correctly identifies the alkyl substituent as a **sec-butyl group**. An isobutyl group, a common distractor, would have a different NMR spectrum (e.g., a doublet for 6H). Combining all the pieces, the structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThis step requires knowledge of the specified chemical transformation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Reagent Function.** The reagents are **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its specific function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) directly to a **methyl group (-CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Predicting the Transformation.** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group. The aromatic ring and the existing sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and remain unchanged. Therefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision**\n\nThe final step is to match the identified product with the provided multiple-choice options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 7: Matching the Product and Analyzing Distractors.**\n    *   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n        *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X), a common distractor.\n        *   C) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - **This is the correct final product.**\n        *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. This has the wrong alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n\nAll candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis.
