The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate (the Michael donor) will then attack the α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Site of Deprotonation (Regioselectivity)**. The first critical step is to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are those adjacent to the carbonyl group, at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at position **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is completely regioselective, and only one enolate can be formed. There is no competition between kinetic and thermodynamic enolates.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, which is nucleophilic at C6, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 2: Naming of Product A**. After the addition and protonation, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. The options name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the ring as a substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1. The numbering continues to give the principal functional group on the ring (the oxo group) the lowest possible number, which is C2.\n    *   This places a **methyl** group at C1, the **oxo** group at C2, and the **ethyl** and **methyl** groups at C3.\n    *   The correct substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate) that attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The base removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form the nucleophile `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n4.  **Careful Point 3: Naming of Product B**. The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this, we must identify the principal functional group. The nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority than the nitro group (-NO₂) and determines the parent chain name.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons. The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering must start from the nitrile carbon as C1: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   This places a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the two major products are:\n*   **Product A**: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B**: 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nNow, we compare this correct pair of names with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n    *   (Product A is correct, but Product B is incorrect.)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n    *   (Both Product A and Product B are incorrect.)\n*   **C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   **(Both Product A and Product B are correct.)**\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n    *   (Product A is incorrect, but Product B is correct.)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both major products is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by breaking down each reaction.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as a base, resulting in product A.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is used to create a nucleophile from the ketone (the Michael donor). This nucleophile then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**: The first crucial step is to determine where the base will remove a proton. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (α-carbons) are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** available for removal.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is therefore completely regioselective, and only one specific enolate can be formed.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, which is nucleophilic at the C6 carbon, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**: The resulting molecule has an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this complex structure according to the options, we treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the ring as a substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is designated as C1 of the substituent. The numbering then proceeds around the ring to give the highest priority functional group (the oxo group) the lowest possible number, which is C2.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the substituents on the ring as follows: a **methyl** group at C1, an **oxo** group at C2, and an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group at C3.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent gives: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH as a base, resulting in product B.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the 1-nitropropane to create a carbanion (a nitronate), which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The protons on the carbon alpha to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic. KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane to form the nucleophilic anion `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Naming of Product B**: The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we must first identify the principal functional group, which determines the suffix of the name. According to IUPAC priority rules, the nitrile group (`-CN`) has higher priority than the nitro group (`-NO₂`).\n    *   The parent chain is the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon. This chain is six carbons long: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   The parent name is therefore **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering from C1 (the nitrile carbon), we find a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed chemical analysis:\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nNow, we match this correct pair of products with the given multiple-choice options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and Correct B**)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both major products is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer. The core of the task is to correctly predict the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions and then determine their correct IUPAC names.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The strong, bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate (the Michael donor). This enolate then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Site of Deprotonation (Regioselectivity)**: The base abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon). We must examine the two α-carbons of the ketone:\n    *   The carbon at position **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons**.\n    *   The carbon at position **C6** is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is therefore completely regioselective, and only one specific enolate can be formed.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, which is nucleophilic at C6, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 2: Naming Product A**: The resulting product has a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this product according to the options, it is treated as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the ring substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1. The numbering continues around the ring to give the principal functional group (the oxo group) the lowest possible number, which is C2.\n    *   This places a **methyl** group at C1, an **oxo** group at C2, and an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group at C3.\n    *   The correct substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate) that attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The base removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form the nucleophile `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n4.  **Careful Point 3: Naming Product B**: The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this, we must identify the principal functional group.

A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Careful Point 2: Naming Product A**.

The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate) that attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation and Attack**: The base removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form the nucleophile `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.

The process involves breaking down each reaction, identifying the key chemical principles at play, and correctly naming the resulting products according to IUPAC nomenclature.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The reaction involves a ketone (Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (Michael acceptor), and a strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). The base's function is to create a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. The most critical step is determining where the base will abstract a proton. The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the C=O group), at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is completely regioselective, meaning only one enolate is formed. The question's mention of \"steric hindrance\" is relevant in that t-BuOK is a bulky base, but in this case, there is no choice between a kinetic and thermodynamic enolate; only one is possible.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, which is nucleophilic at the C6 position, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. After the addition and protonation, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this product correctly, we follow the format in the options, treating it as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The entire cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the ring substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1. Numbering continues to give the principal functional group on the ring (the oxo group) the lowest possible number, which is C2.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the substituents on the ring as follows: a **methyl** group at C1, an **oxo** group at C2, and an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group at C3.\n    *   The complete substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the 1-nitropropane to create a nucleophile, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The protons on the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group in 1-nitropropane are acidic. KOH removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Naming of Product B**. The resulting structure after protonation by water is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this, we must first identify the principal functional group, which determines the parent chain. The nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority than the nitro group (-NO₂).\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons. Therefore, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering begins at the nitrile carbon as C1: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   This places the substituents as a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing this correct pair of names with the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nOption A is the only choice that correctly identifies both major products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. The first crucial step is to determine where the ketone will be deprotonated. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (α-carbons) are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is completely regioselective, meaning only one specific enolate is formed.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, which is nucleophilic at the C6 position, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate chain.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. The resulting product has a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this complex molecule according to the options, it is treated as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   **Parent Chain**: The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   **Substituent**: The entire cyclohexanone ring system is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   **Naming the Substituent**: According to IUPAC rules, the ring carbon attached to the parent chain is numbered C1. This is the original C6 of the ketone. The numbering then continues around the ring to give the principal functional group on the ring (the oxo group) the lowest possible number, which is C2.\n        *   At C1 (original C6), there is a **methyl** group.\n        *   At C2 (original C1), there is an **oxo** group.\n        *   At C3 (original C2), there is an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Assembling the substituent name gives: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group, creating a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate). This nucleophile then attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The carbanion of 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Naming of Product B**. The resulting structure after protonation by water is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   **Principal Functional Group**: The nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority in nomenclature than the nitro group (-NO₂). Therefore, the parent chain is a nitrile.\n    *   **Parent Chain Length**: The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons. Thus, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   **Numbering**: The chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`\n    *   **Substituents**: This numbering scheme places a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the detailed chemical analysis:\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nNow, we match this correct pair of products with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and Correct B**)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both major products is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer by breaking down each reaction and identifying the key decision points.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: The reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester, and a strong, sterically hindered base (potassium tert-butoxide).

The process involves breaking down each reaction, identifying the key chemical principles at play, correctly naming the resulting products, and then matching them to the given options.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a **Michael addition**. The strong, bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate (the Michael donor). This enolate will then attack the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Site of Deprotonation (Regioselectivity)**. The most critical step is determining where the base will remove a proton. The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group):\n    *   **C2**: This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6**: This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is therefore completely regioselective, and only one specific enolate can be formed, which is nucleophilic at C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: Naming of Product A**. After the C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate and the intermediate is protonated, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this product according to IUPAC rules and match the options:\n    *   The parent chain is identified as **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The entire cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the ring substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1. Numbering continues to give the principal functional group on the ring (the oxo group) the lowest possible number, which is C2.\n    *   This places the substituents on the ring as follows: a **methyl** group at C1, an **oxo** group at C2, and an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group at C3.\n    *   The full name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a **Michael addition**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group, creating a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate). This nucleophile attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 3: Naming of Product B**. The nucleophilic α-carbon of 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this, we must first identify the principal functional group, which is the **nitrile (-CN)** as it has higher priority than the nitro group (-NO₂).\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon determines the parent name. This chain is six carbons long: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1. This places a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed chemical analysis:\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nNow, we match this correct pair of names with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n    *   (Product A is correct, but Product B is incorrect).\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n    *   (Both Product A and Product B are incorrect).\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n    *   **(Both Product A and Product B are correct).**\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n    *   (Product A is incorrect, but Product B is correct).\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both major products is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the chemical reactions and the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct option.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), acts to deprotonate the ketone, creating a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. The most critical step is determining which α-proton is removed. The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the C=O group): C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons**.\n    *   The carbon at position **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is therefore completely regioselective, and only one specific enolate can be formed. There is no competition between kinetic and thermodynamic enolates.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, which is nucleophilic at the C6 position, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate chain.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Nomenclature of Product A**. After the reaction, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. The options require naming this product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The entire cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the complex ring substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1. The numbering then proceeds to give the principal functional group on the ring (the oxo group) the lowest possible number, which is C2.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the substituents on the ring as follows: a **methyl** group at C1, an **oxo** group at C2, and an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group at C3.\n    *   The complete name for the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group, creating a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate anion). This nucleophile attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The base removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form the nucleophile `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n\n4.  **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Nomenclature of Product B**. The resulting structure after protonation is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The principal functional group must be identified to name the parent chain.

The α-carbons are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at position **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen). It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is completely regioselective, and the nucleophilic attack will originate from C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Nomenclature of Product A**. After the enolate attacks ethyl acrylate, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this product according to the options, it is treated as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the ring substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1. Numbering continues around the ring to give the principal functional group (the oxo group) the lowest possible number, which is C2.\n    *   This numbering places a **methyl** group at C1, an **oxo** group at C2, and an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group at C3.\n    *   The correct substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic carbanion that attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Nomenclature of Product B**. The nucleophile from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   **Principal Functional Group**: The nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority than the nitro group (-NO₂), so the parent chain is a nitrile.\n    *   **Parent Chain**: The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons. The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   **Numbering**: The chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   This places a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct products are:\n*   **Product A**: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B**: 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nNow, we must carefully match this pair with the given options.\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Correct), B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Incorrect), B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Incorrect), B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Correct), B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct)\n\nThe only option where both product names are correct is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate (the Michael donor) will then attack the α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Site of Deprotonation (Regioselectivity)**. The first critical step is to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are those adjacent to the carbonyl group, at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at position **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is completely regioselective, and only one enolate can be formed. There is no competition between kinetic and thermodynamic enolates.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, which is nucleophilic at C6, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 2: Naming of Product A**. After the addition and protonation, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. The options name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the ring as a substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1.

The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate) that attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The base removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form the nucleophile `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n4.  **Careful Point 3: Naming of Product B**. The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this, we must identify the principal functional group. The nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority than the nitro group (-NO₂) and determines the parent chain name.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons.

The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is used to create a nucleophile from the ketone (the Michael donor). This nucleophile then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**: The first crucial step is to determine where the base will remove a proton. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (α-carbons) are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** available for removal.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is therefore completely regioselective, and only one specific enolate can be formed.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, which is nucleophilic at the C6 carbon, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**: The resulting molecule has an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this complex structure according to the options, we treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the ring as a substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is designated as C1 of the substituent. The numbering then proceeds around the ring to give the highest priority functional group (the oxo group) the lowest possible number, which is C2.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the substituents on the ring as follows: a **methyl** group at C1, an **oxo** group at C2, and an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group at C3.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent gives: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH as a base, resulting in product B.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the 1-nitropropane to create a carbanion (a nitronate), which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The protons on the carbon alpha to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic. KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane to form the nucleophilic anion `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Naming of Product B**: The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we must first identify the principal functional group, which determines the suffix of the name. According to IUPAC priority rules, the nitrile group (`-CN`) has higher priority than the nitro group (`-NO₂`).\n    *   The parent chain is the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon. This chain is six carbons long: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   The parent name is therefore **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering from C1 (the nitrile carbon), we find a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed chemical analysis:\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nNow, we match this correct pair of products with the given multiple-choice options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and Correct B**)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both major products is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer. The core of the task is to correctly predict the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions and then determine their correct IUPAC names.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The strong, bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate (the Michael donor). This enolate then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Site of Deprotonation (Regioselectivity)**: The base abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon). We must examine the two α-carbons of the ketone:\n    *   The carbon at position **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons**.\n    *   The carbon at position **C6** is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom.

The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate) that attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The base removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form the nucleophile `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n4.  **Careful Point 3: Naming Product B**: The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this, we must identify the principal functional group. The nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority than the nitro group (-NO₂), so it determines the parent chain name.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons.

The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Site of Deprotonation (Regioselectivity)**. The first crucial step is to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are those adjacent to the carbonyl group, at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at position **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.

The steric hindrance of the base is not a deciding factor here, as there is no choice between two possible sites.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, which is nucleophilic at C6, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Careful Point 2: Naming Product A**. After the addition and protonation, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.

The reaction involves a ketone (Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (Michael acceptor), and a strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). The base's function is to create a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. The most critical step is determining where the base will abstract a proton. The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the C=O group), at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is completely regioselective, meaning only one enolate is formed. The question's mention of \"steric hindrance\" is relevant in that t-BuOK is a bulky base, but in this case, there is no choice between a kinetic and thermodynamic enolate; only one is possible.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, which is nucleophilic at the C6 position, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**.

The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. The most critical step is identifying which α-proton is removed. The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons**.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom.

The nucleophilic attack will originate from C6.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The C6-enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. The resulting product has a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.

KOH removes one of these protons to form the nucleophile `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n\n4.  **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Naming of Product B**. The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   **Functional Group Priority**: The nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority than the nitro group (-NO₂) and determines the parent chain name.\n    *   **Parent Chain Identification**: The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon must be found. This chain is six carbons long. The parent name is therefore **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   **Numbering**: The nitrile carbon is always C1.

The reaction is therefore completely regioselective, and only one specific enolate can be formed, which is nucleophilic at C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: Naming of Product A**. After the C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate and the intermediate is protonated, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.

The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this, we must first identify the principal functional group, which is the **nitrile (-CN)** as it has higher priority than the nitro group (-NO₂).\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon determines the parent name.

The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is completely regioselective, and only one enolate can be formed. All candidate answers correctly identified this crucial point.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Nomenclature of Product A**: After the C6-enolate attacks the ethyl acrylate and the intermediate is protonated, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to C6 of the original ketone. The options require naming this product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the ring substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1. Numbering continues to give the principal functional group on the ring (the oxo group) the lowest possible number, which is C2.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the substituents on the ring as follows: a **methyl** group at C1, an **oxo** group at C2, and an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group at C3.\n    *   Assembling the name gives the substituent as **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH as a base.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate).\n\n2.  **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Nomenclature of Product B**: The nucleophile from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), which has higher priority than the nitro group (-NO₂). The parent chain must contain the nitrile carbon.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile is six carbons long. Therefore, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering begins at the nitrile carbon as C1. This places a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe detailed chemical analysis, which is in agreement with the reasoning presented in all candidate answers, confirms the identities of the two products:\n*   **Product A**: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B**: 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nNow, we match this correct pair of products with the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n    *   (Product A is correct, but Product B is incorrect).\n*   **B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   **(Both Product A and Product B are correct).**\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n    *   (Both Product A and Product B are incorrect).\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n    *   (Product A is incorrect, but Product B is correct).\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both major products is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
