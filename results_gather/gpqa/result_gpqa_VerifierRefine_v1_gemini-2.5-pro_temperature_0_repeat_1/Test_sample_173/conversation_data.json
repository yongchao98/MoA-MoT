    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Initial nucleus: Mass M, at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Fission process: The nucleus splits into two fragments, with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Mass relation of fragments: One is twice as massive as the other. Let `m1` be the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   Sum of final rest-masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   Goal: Find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy (`T1`) and the classical kinetic energy (`T1_classical`) of the more massive fragment (`m1`).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments:**\n    *   The total rest-mass energy of the fragments is `(m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2`.\n    *   Substituting the given value: `(m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Now, use the mass relation `m1 = 2 * m2`. In terms of rest-mass energy, this is `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n    *   Substitute this into the sum: `(2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   This gives the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is: `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws to Find Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before fission equals the total energy after.\n        *   Initial Energy `E_initial = Mc^2` (since the nucleus is at rest).\n        *   Final Energy `E_final = (T1 + m1*c^2) + (T2 + m2*c^2)`, where `T1` and `T2` are the kinetic energies of the fragments.\n    *   The total kinetic energy released, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n        *   `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n        *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy `T1`:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n    *   The relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n    *   We can also write this in terms of kinetic energy `T` (since `E = T + mc^2`): `(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, which simplifies to `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n    *   Since `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n    *   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`. Substitute this and the mass-energy values into the equation:\n        `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n        `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out.\n        `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n        `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    *   Group the `T1` terms:\n        `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n        `600*T1 = 603`\n        `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   So, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T1 = 1005 MeV`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Kinetic Energy `T1_classical`:**\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T_cl = p_cl^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   From momentum conservation (`|p1_cl| = |p2_cl|`), we have `2*m1*T1_cl = 2*m2*T2_cl`.\n    *   This gives the ratio of kinetic energies: `T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1`.\n    *   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   So, `T1_cl / T2_cl = 1/2`, which means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n    *   The total kinetic energy is still `Q = T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substitute `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`:\n        `T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n        `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n        `T1_cl = 1 GeV`.\n    *   So, the classical kinetic energy is `T1_classical = 1000 MeV`.\n\n6.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   The difference is `|T1 - T1_classical|`.\n    *   Difference = `|1005 MeV - 1000 MeV| = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>",
