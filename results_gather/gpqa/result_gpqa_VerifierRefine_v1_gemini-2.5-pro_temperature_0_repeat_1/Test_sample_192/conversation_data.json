    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Given Information**\nThe problem states that the number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, according to the relationship:\n`N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** This statement, \"the number of stars varies with parallax,\" typically refers to the number of stars found within a small interval of parallax, `d(plx)`. This is a differential quantity, which we can write as `dN/d(plx)`. So, the given relationship is more precisely:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is another differential quantity, `dN/dr`. Our goal is to find the proportionality between `dN/dr` and `r`.\n\n**Step 3: Recall the Fundamental Relationship between Distance and Parallax**\nParallax (`plx`) is defined as the inverse of the distance (`r`) to a star (when using standard units of arcseconds and parsecs).\n`plx = 1/r` or `r = 1/plx`\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** This inverse relationship is key to converting the given information about parallax into the desired information about distance.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the Two Differential Quantities using the Chain Rule**\nWe want to find `dN/dr`, and we know `dN/d(plx)`. We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule of calculus:\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`**\nWe need to differentiate the parallax-distance relationship (`plx = 1/r`) with respect to `r`.\n`plx = r^-1`\n`d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r^-1) = -1 * r^-2 = -1/r^2`\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The negative sign indicates that as distance (`r`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases, which is physically correct. However, for star counts, we are interested in the magnitude of the relationship, as the number of stars in a given range cannot be negative. So, we will use the absolute value:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2`\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the Known Proportionalities into the Chain Rule Equation**\nNow we combine the pieces. We are looking for the proportionality, so we can ignore constants.\n`dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\nSubstitute the given proportionality and the derivative we just calculated:\n`dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\n**Step 7: Express the Final Relationship Solely in Terms of Distance `r`**\nThe current expression has both `plx` and `r`. We must convert `plx` to `r` using the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n`dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r^2)`\nSimplify the first term: `1 / (1/r)^5 = r^5`.\n`dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\n**Step 8: Final Simplification**\nCombine the powers of `r`:\n`dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n`dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) in that region of the sky changes in proportion to the cube of the distance (`r^3`).\n\n<<<A>>>",
