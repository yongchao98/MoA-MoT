    This function symbolically verifies the derivation for the number of stars per unit distance.

    The problem is to find how the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr)
    varies with distance (r), given that the number of stars per unit parallax
    (dN/d(plx)) varies as 1/plx^5.

    The key relationships are:
    1. dN/d(plx) ‚àù 1/plx^5
    2. plx = 1/r
    3. The change of variable formula (from chain rule): dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|
       The absolute value is used because we are relating positive number densities over positive intervals.
