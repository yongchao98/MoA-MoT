    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2. This can be expressed as (Mass of system_1) / (Mass of system_2).\n\n**2. Extract the Given Information**\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1a (K1a) = 10 km/s\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1b (K1b) = 5 km/s\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2a (K2a) = 15 km/s\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2b (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n**3. Identify the Relevant Physics Principles and Formulas**\nThe problem describes double-lined spectroscopic binaries (we have radial velocity data for both stars in each system). For such systems, we can determine the total mass using a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law.\n\nThe total mass (M_total = M_a + M_b) of a binary system is related to its period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K_a and K_b) by the following equation:\n\nM_total = (P * (K_a + K_b)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))\n\nwhere:\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n**4. Analyze the Careful Points and Simplifications**\n*   **Eclipsing Systems:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\". This is a crucial piece of information. An eclipse can only occur if we are viewing the system nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°.\n*   **Inclination Angle (i):** For i ≈ 90°, the value of sin(i) ≈ 1. Consequently, sin³(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass equation significantly, as we can remove the sin³(i) term.\n*   **Circular Orbits:** The problem mentions \"sinusoidal variations\" of radial velocities. This is characteristic of circular orbits, which validates the use of the standard formula.\n*   **Ratio Calculation:** Since we are calculating a ratio of two masses, the constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` will cancel out, simplifying the calculation further.\n\n**5. Apply the Formula to Each System**\n\nThe simplified relationship for the total mass is:\nM_total ∝ P * (K_a + K_b)³\n\n*   **For System 1:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   Sum of velocity amplitudes: K_total_1 = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   Therefore, M_sys1 ∝ P1 * (K_total_1)³ = 2 * (15)³\n\n*   **For System 2:**\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   Sum of velocity amplitudes: K_total_2 = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n    *   Therefore, M_sys2 ∝ P2 * (K_total_2)³ = 1 * (25)³\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nNow, we compute the ratio of the mass of system_1 to the mass of system_2:\n\nRatio = M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P1 * (K_total_1)³] / [P2 * (K_total_2)³]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\nRatio = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nRatio = 2 * (15 / 25)³\n\nSimplify the fraction (15 / 25):\n\n15 / 25 = 3 / 5\n\nNow, substitute this back into the ratio equation:\n\nRatio = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nRatio = 2 * (3³ / 5³)\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n\nRatio = 0.432\n\n**7.
