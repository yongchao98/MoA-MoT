    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the entropy of the black hole.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe main goal is to find the order of magnitude of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (S) of a supermassive black hole. To do this, we need to first determine the size of its event horizon from the given observational data (angular size and distance).\n\n**2. List Given Information and Constants:**\n*   Distance to the black hole, `d = 10^10` parsecs.\n*   Angular size of the event horizon, `θ = 10^-17` degrees.\n*   **Physical Constants needed:**\n    *   Parsec to meter conversion: `1 pc ≈ 3.086 × 10^16 m`\n    *   Degree to radian conversion: `1° = π/180 rad`\n    *   Boltzmann constant: `k_B ≈ 1.38 × 10^-23 J/K`\n    *   Speed of light: `c ≈ 3.00 × 10^8 m/s`\n    *   Gravitational constant: `G ≈ 6.67 × 10^-11 N·m²/kg²`\n    *   Reduced Planck constant: `ħ ≈ 1.05 × 10^-34 J·s`\n\n**3. Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Unit Consistency:** All calculations must be performed in SI units (meters, kilograms, seconds, Kelvin). This means we must convert the distance from parsecs to meters and the angular size from degrees to radians.\n*   **Small-Angle Approximation:** For a very small angle `θ` (in radians), the physical size (diameter `D`) of an object at distance `d` is given by `D ≈ d * θ`. The given angle is extremely small, so this approximation is valid.\n*   **Relevant Formulas:**\n    *   The radius of the event horizon is the Schwarzschild radius, `R_s`. The diameter is `D = 2 * R_s`.\n    *   The area of the event horizon (a sphere) is `A = 4 * π * R_s^2`.\n    *   The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is `S = (k_B * c^3 * A) / (4 * G * ħ)`.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Radius of the Event Horizon (R_s)**\n\nFirst, convert the given distance and angle to SI units.\n*   **Distance (d) in meters:**\n    `d = 10^10 pc * (3.086 × 10^16 m/pc) = 3.086 × 10^26 m`\n*   **Angular size (θ) in radians:**\n    `θ = 10^-17 degrees * (π / 180 rad/degree) ≈ 1.745 × 10^-19 rad`\n\nNext, use the small-angle approximation to find the diameter (`D`) of the event horizon.\n*   `D = d * θ ≈ (3.086 × 10^26 m) * (1.745 × 10^-19 rad) ≈ 5.385 × 10^7 m`\n\nThe radius `R_s` is half the diameter.\n*   `R_s = D / 2 ≈ (5.385 × 10^7 m) / 2 ≈ 2.69 × 10^7 m`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy (S)**\n\nThe formula for entropy is `S = (k_B * c^3 * A) / (4 * G * ħ)`. We can substitute `A = 4 * π * R_s^2` into this formula to get a direct relation with `R_s`.\n*   `S = (k_B * c^3 * (4 * π * R_s^2)) / (4 * G * ħ)`\n*   `S = (k_B * π * c^3 * R_s^2) / (G * ħ)`\n\nNow, substitute the values of the physical constants and the calculated `R_s`.\n*   `S ≈ ( (1.38 × 10^-23) * (3.14) * (3 × 10^8)^3 * (2.69 × 10^7)^2 ) / ( (6.67 × 10^-11) * (1.05 × 10^-34) )`\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and denominator separately.\n*   **Numerator:**\n    `Num ≈ (1.38 × 10^-23) * (3.14) * (27 × 10^24) * (7.24 × 10^14)`\n    `Num ≈ (1.38 * 3.14 * 27 * 7.24) × 10^(-23 + 24 + 14)`\n    `Num ≈ 846 × 10^15 = 8.46 × 10^17`\n*   **Denominator:**\n    `Den ≈ (6.67 × 10^-11) * (1.05 × 10^-34)`\n    `Den ≈ (6.67 * 1.05) × 10^(-11 - 34)`\n    `Den ≈ 7.0 × 10^-45`\n\nNow, divide the numerator by the denominator.\n*   `S ≈ (8.46 × 10^17) / (7.0 × 10^-45)`\n*   `S ≈ (8.46 / 7.0) × 10^(17 - (-45))`\n*   `S ≈ 1.21 × 10^(17 + 45)`\n*   `S ≈ 1.21 × 10^62 J/K`\n\n**Step 3: Find the Order of Magnitude**\n\nThe calculated value for the entropy is `1.21 × 10^62 J/K`. The order of magnitude is the power of 10, which is `10^62`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 10^66 J/K\nB) 10^59 J/K\nC) 10^62 J/K\nD) 10^65 J/K\n\nThe calculated order of magnitude matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
