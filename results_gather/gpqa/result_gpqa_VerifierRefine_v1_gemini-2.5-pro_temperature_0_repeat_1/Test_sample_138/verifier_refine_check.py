    This function checks the correctness of the selected option for a chemical reaction question.
    It codifies the rules of the reaction and evaluates each option.

    Reaction: Ketone α-oxidation using NaNO2/HCl.
    Rule 1: The starting material must be a ketone.
    Rule 2: The ketone must have an α-methylene (-CH2-) group.
    Rule 3: The oxidation occurs at this α-methylene group to form an α-diketone.
