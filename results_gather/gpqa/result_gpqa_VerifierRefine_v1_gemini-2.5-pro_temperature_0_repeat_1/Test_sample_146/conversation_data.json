    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process and Conservation Laws:**\n    The problem describes a particle annihilation process: $p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$. In any such interaction, both total energy and total momentum must be conserved. Since the speeds involved are likely to be high, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   The system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a key piece of information. It implies that the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can therefore approximate its initial momentum as zero and its total energy as its rest mass energy, $m_{\\bar{p}}c^2$.\n    *   Typically, in such problems, the proton is considered to be the stationary target. So, the proton's initial momentum is also zero, and its total energy is its rest mass energy, $m_{p}c^2$.\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum ($P_{initial}$):** Since both particles are at rest or moving very slowly, the total initial momentum of the system is approximately zero. $P_{initial} \\approx 0$.\n    *   **Total Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.\n        *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n        *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n        *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   The problem states that the rest mass energy of each of these particles is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the four A particles must fly off in directions such that their vector momenta sum to zero.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total final energy ($E_{final}$) must be equal to the total initial energy.\n        *   $E_{final} = E_{initial} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Energy of a Single 'A' Particle:**\n    *   The total final energy of 1876 MeV is shared among the four final particles.\n    *   Because the initial momentum was zero and all four final particles have the same mass, by symmetry, the energy must be distributed equally among them.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of a single A particle ($E_A$) is:\n        $E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Velocity of Particle A:**\n    *   The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   We can now calculate the Lorentz factor for particle A:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5633$\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can rearrange this to solve for the velocity, $v$.\n        *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        *   $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        *   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Now, substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n        *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}}$\n        *   $v/c \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n        *   $v/c \\approx 0.7687$\n    *   Thus, the velocity of particle A is approximately $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **\"Slowly moving\" approximation:** This is crucial for setting the initial momentum to zero and simplifying the initial energy calculation.\n*   **Relativistic formulas:** The energy of the final particles (469 MeV) is significantly larger than their rest mass energy (300 MeV), indicating they are moving at relativistic speeds. Non-relativistic formulas ($K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$) would give an incorrect answer.\n*   **Symmetry:** The assumption that energy is shared equally among the final particles is justified by the symmetry of the initial state (zero momentum) and the final state (four identical particles).\n*   **Constants:** You need to know the rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2 \\approx 938$ MeV).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
