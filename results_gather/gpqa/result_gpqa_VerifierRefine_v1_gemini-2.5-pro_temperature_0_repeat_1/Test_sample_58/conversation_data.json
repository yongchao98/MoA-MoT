    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Identify the chemical species and their nature:**\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):** A weak acid.\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid):** A strong acid. It dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide):** A strong base. It dissociates completely into Ba2+ and 2 OH-.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial moles of each substance:**\nThe formula for moles is: Moles = Molarity (M) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = 0.1 M × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Ba(OH)2:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles = 0.3 M × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the total moles of acidic protons (H+) and hydroxide ions (OH-):**\n*   **Total moles of H+:**\n    *   From strong acid (HCl): 0.080 mol (since HCl is monoprotic, 1 mole of HCl gives 1 mole of H+).\n    *   From weak acid (CH3COOH): 0.050 mol (this is the total amount of acid available to react).\n    *   Total moles of acid (H+ equivalents) = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol.\n\n*   **Total moles of OH-:**\n    *   From strong base (Ba(OH)2): 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2 × 2 mol OH-/mol Ba(OH)2 = 0.180 mol OH-.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Ba(OH)2 is a dihydroxic base, so it releases two moles of OH- for every mole of Ba(OH)2.\n\n**4. Determine the excess reactant after neutralization:**\nThe neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. We compare the total moles of acid equivalents with the total moles of base.\n\n*   Total moles of acid (H+) = 0.130 mol\n*   Total moles of base (OH-) = 0.180 mol\n\nSince there are more moles of OH- than H+, the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n*   **Moles of excess OH-:**\n    *   Excess OH- = Total OH- - Total H+\n    *   Excess OH- = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**5. Calculate the concentration of the excess OH- in the final solution:**\nFirst, calculate the total volume of the mixed solution.\n\n*   **Total Volume:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\nNow, calculate the molarity of the excess OH-.\n\n*   **[OH-] concentration:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**Careful Point:** The pH of the solution is now determined by this concentration of the strong base (OH-). The presence of the conjugate base (CH3COO-) formed from the neutralization of acetic acid will have a negligible effect on the pH because its contribution to the OH- concentration is suppressed by the much larger concentration from the excess strong base.\n\n**6. Calculate the pOH and then the pH:**\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167)\n    *   pOH ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is: pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>",
