    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine which exoplanet has the highest density.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept of planetary density.**\nDensity is defined as mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius. The density of a planet depends on its composition (what it's made of) and the degree of gravitational compression caused by its own mass.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each option.**\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    *   This is our baseline reference. The Earth has an average density of approximately 5.5 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³).\n    *   Density (a) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.**\n    *   The density for this planet is explicitly given in the description.\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n    *   **Careful point:** While a planet with 2 Earth masses and the same composition as Earth would be denser due to compression, this specific planet is defined as having a density of 5.5 g/cm³. This implies it must have a different, less dense bulk composition or be significantly hotter than Earth. We must use the value given.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    *   This planet is a \"Super-Earth\". It is made of the same materials as Earth (e.g., an iron core and a silicate mantle).\n    *   **Careful point:** The key factor here is **gravitational compression**. With five times the mass, the planet's self-gravity is much stronger. This immense gravity squeezes the materials inside the planet, forcing the atoms closer together and making the material denser.\n    *   Therefore, the overall average density of this planet will be significantly *higher* than Earth's density.\n    *   Density (c) > 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    *   This planet is a \"sub-Earth\". It has the same composition as Earth but less mass.\n    *   **Careful point:** With less mass, the self-gravity is weaker. There is less gravitational compression acting on the materials.\n    *   Therefore, the overall average density of this planet will be *lower* than Earth's density.\n    *   Density (d) < 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the densities.**\n\nLet's summarize the densities of the four planets:\n*   Density (a) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (c) > 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (d) < 5.5 g/cm³\n\n**Step 4: Acquire the final answer.**\n\nBy comparing the four values, it is clear that the planet described in option (c) has the highest density because the increased mass leads to greater gravitational compression.\n\nThe correct option is (c). Looking at the provided answer choices (A, B, C, D), option (c) corresponds to D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
