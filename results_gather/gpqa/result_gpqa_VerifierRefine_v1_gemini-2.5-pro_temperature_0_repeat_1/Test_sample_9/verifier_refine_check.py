    Checks the correctness of the answer about exoplanet density.

    The core principle is that for planets of the same composition, density increases
    with mass due to gravitational compression. This can be modeled with a mass-radius
    relationship R ∝ M^k, where k < 1/3 for rocky planets. This implies a mass-density
    relationship ρ ∝ M^(1-3k), where the exponent is positive, meaning density
    increases with mass.
