    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**1. Understand C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has the following key symmetry elements:\n*   A principal axis of rotation of order 3 (a **C3 axis**). This means the molecule looks identical after a rotation of 360°/3 = 120° around this axis.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (**σh**) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   The presence of C3 and σh automatically generates an S3 improper rotation axis.\n*   A key feature of the C3h point group is the *absence* of any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and the *absence* of any vertical mirror planes (σv).\n\n**2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\n**A) quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It has a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    *   There is **no** horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this C3 axis. A plane cutting through the middle of the C-C bonds of the \"wings\" would not map the top half (with the N atom) onto the bottom half (with the CH group).\n    *   It does have three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since it has a C3 axis and three σv planes but no σh plane, quinuclidine belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n\n**B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a complex name for a molecule more commonly known as **mellitic trianhydride**. It consists of a central benzene ring to which three five-membered anhydride rings are fused. The entire molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   There is a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   There **is** a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Since the molecule is perfectly flat, the plane of the molecule itself acts as a mirror plane. Reflecting any atom through this plane lands it back on itself. This plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses both a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane. Therefore, it belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has a triphenylene core (a planar arrangement of four fused benzene rings) with three anhydride rings fused to its outer edges. This molecule is also planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center.\n    *   It has a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which is the plane of the molecule.\n    *   **However**, it also possesses three C2 axes that lie within the molecular plane and pass through the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane means this molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group, not C3h.\n\n**D) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is B(O-iPr)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-CH(CH3)2). The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the three bulky isopropyl groups will arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion, all twisted in the same direction relative to the B(O)3 plane.\n    *   This propeller arrangement has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n    *   There is **no** horizontal mirror plane (σh). The isopropyl groups are not planar. The methyl groups (CH3) and the methine hydrogen (CH) stick out from the B(O)3 plane. Reflecting the molecule through this plane would move the atoms to positions where no atoms exist.\n*   **Conclusion:** The most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate belongs to the **C3** point group.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, only benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone has the required C3 axis and perpendicular σh plane, with no perpendicular C2 axes, characteristic of the C3h point group.\n\n<<<B>>>",
