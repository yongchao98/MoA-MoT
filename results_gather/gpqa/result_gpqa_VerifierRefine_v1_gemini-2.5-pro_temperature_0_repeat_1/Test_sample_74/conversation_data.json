    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Experimental Setup**\nThe primary goal is to create a recombinant GADD45G protein with an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. This construct is intended for inducible overexpression in a mouse model to study protein-protein interactions after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The initial test of the construct is performed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Problem**\nThe experiment fails. The expected full-length, HA-tagged GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in the CHO cells. The task is to find the reason for this failure by analyzing the provided DNA sequence of the construct.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Provided DNA Sequence**\nThe sequence is the plus strand (coding strand) of the DNA construct. For protein synthesis, this strand is transcribed into mRNA (with U replacing T), and then the mRNA is translated into a protein. We need to read the DNA sequence in groups of three (codons) starting from the initiation codon.\n\nThe sequence is:\n5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA 3'\n\n**Step 4: Translate the DNA Sequence into an Amino Acid Sequence**\nWe will translate the sequence codon by codon, paying close attention to the start, the tag, and any potential stop codons.\n\n*   **Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `ATG`. This is the universal start codon, which codes for Methionine (Met). Translation will begin here.\n*   **HA Tag Sequence:** The problem states an N-terminal HA tag was added. The amino acid sequence for the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let's see if the DNA sequence codes for this.\n    *   `ATG` -> Met (M)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    The translated sequence `M-YPYDVPDYA` matches the intended N-terminal Met followed by the HA tag. So far, the construct is correct.\n\n*   **GADD45G Coding Sequence:** The sequence for the GADD45G protein should follow the HA tag. Let's continue translating.\n    *   The next codon is `AAA`, which codes for Lysine (Lys).\n    *   The codon immediately after that is `TGA`.\n\n*   **Identify Stop Codons:** There are three stop codons in the genetic code: `TAA` (UAA in mRNA), `TAG` (UAG in mRNA), and `TGA` (UGA in mRNA). The codon `TGA` found in the sequence is a stop codon.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Consequence of the Premature Stop Codon**\nThe presence of the `TGA` stop codon so early in the sequence (right after the HA tag and the first amino acid of GADD45G) will signal the ribosome to stop translation. This is called premature termination. Instead of producing the full-length HA-GADD45G protein, the cell will only produce a very short, truncated peptide (Met-YPYDVPDYA-Lys). This truncated peptide would not be detected as the full-length protein in the analysis, explaining the observed lack of overexpression.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA` (UGA), not `TAA` (UAA). Second, the absence of a tRNA for a stop codon is the normal mechanism by which termination occurs; it is not a flaw in the construct.\n*   **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is the correct conclusion. The premature `TGA` stop codon in the engineered sequence caused translation to halt, preventing the synthesis of the full-length protein.\n*   **C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** Our analysis in Step 4 showed that the DNA sequence correctly codes for the standard HA tag (YPYDVPDYA). There is no mutation within the tag sequence.\n*   **D) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While a linker can be beneficial for protein folding, its absence is not the primary, definitive error here. The protein is not even being fully synthesized in the first place due to the premature stop codon. Proteolysis (degradation) of a misfolded protein is a secondary issue that is irrelevant when the full protein is never made.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe analysis of the DNA sequence reveals a premature stop codon (`TGA`) immediately following the sequence for the HA tag and the first codon of the GADD45G gene. This leads to early termination of translation, which is the direct cause of the failure to produce the desired full-length protein.\n\n<<<B>>>",
