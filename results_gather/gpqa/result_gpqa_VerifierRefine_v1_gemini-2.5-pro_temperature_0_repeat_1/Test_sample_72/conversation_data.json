    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between them.\nb) The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system.\n\n**2. List Given Information**\n*   Mass of astronaut 1: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1: $v_1 = 0.6c$ (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Mass of astronaut 2: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2: $v_2 = 0.5c$ (in the positive x-direction)\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Part A: Calculating the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Because the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds (a significant fraction of the speed of light), we cannot simply subtract their velocities ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula.\n*   **Formula:** The formula for the relative velocity between two objects (1 and 2) moving in the same direction in a given reference frame is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n*   **Substitution:** Plug in the given values for $v_1$ and $v_2$:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Simplify the numerator: $0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$\n    2.  Simplify the term in the denominator: $\\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2} = \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 0.3$\n    3.  Calculate the denominator: $1 - 0.3 = 0.7$\n    4.  Divide the numerator by the denominator: $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n    5.  Convert the fraction to a decimal: $v_{rel} \\approx 0.1428... c$\n*   **Result for Relative Speed:** Rounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n**Part B: Calculating the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of a relativistic particle is not its kinetic energy, but the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy, given by the formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$. The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of each astronaut.\n*   **Formula:**\n    *   Total energy of a single particle: $E = \\gamma mc^2$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    *   Total energy of the system: $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n        $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_1/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    2.  Calculate the energy $E_1$:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25) \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_2/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3/4}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n    2.  Calculate the energy $E_2$:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}) \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n*   **Calculation for Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    1.  Sum the individual energies: $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    2.  Factor out $mc^2$: $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n    3.  Approximate the value: $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$, so $2\\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.464$\n    4.  Calculate the final sum: $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n*   **Result for Total Energy:** Rounding to two decimal places, the total energy is $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\nThe calculated values are:\n*   $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Goal and Given Information**\nThe objective is to find the relative speed ($v_{rel}$) and the total energy ($E_{total}$) of a system of two astronauts.\n*   Astronaut 1: mass $m_1 = 2m$, velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Astronaut 2: mass $m_2 = 3m$, velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\nBoth astronauts are moving in the same direction.\n\n**2.

The formula for the energy of a single particle is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 + \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2$\n\nThe Lorentz factor is given by $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n        $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Calculate the energy $E_1$:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n    *   Calculate the energy $E_2$:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\n*   **Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   Sum the individual energies:\n        $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n    *   To compare with the options, approximate the numerical value. Using $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n        $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 2 \\times 1.732) mc^2 = (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places:\n        $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\n**4.
