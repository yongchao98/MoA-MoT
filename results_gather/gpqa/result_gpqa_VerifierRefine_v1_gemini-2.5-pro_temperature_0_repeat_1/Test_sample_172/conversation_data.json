    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Principle**\nThe question relates the uncertainty in an electron's position (Δx) to the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. While there is a direct energy-time uncertainty principle (ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2), it's often easier in problems like this to first use the position-momentum uncertainty principle and then relate momentum to energy.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Constants**\n*   Uncertainty in position: Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Speed of the electron: v = 2 * 10⁸ m/s\n*   Reduced Planck's constant: ħ ≈ 1.054 * 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Apply the Position-Momentum Uncertainty Principle.**\n    The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in a particle's position and its momentum along the same axis must be at least a certain minimum value. The formula is:\n    Δx * Δpₓ ≥ ħ / 2\n    To find the *minimum* uncertainty in momentum (Δpₓ), we use the equality:\n    Δpₓ = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δpₓ).**\n    Substitute the known values into the equation from Step 1:\n    Δpₓ = (1.054 * 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    Δpₓ = 5.27 * 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n*   **Step 3: Relate the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to the uncertainty in momentum (Δpₓ).**\n    The relationship between a particle's energy (E) and its momentum (p) can be used to find the relationship between their uncertainties. The uncertainty in energy ΔE can be approximated by:\n    ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp\n    The derivative dE/dp represents the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which is equal to the particle's classical velocity, v.\n    dE/dp = v\n    This relationship holds for both non-relativistic (E = p²/2m) and relativistic (E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²) cases. Therefore, we can write:\n    ΔE ≈ v * Δpₓ\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must use the velocity along the x-direction (vₓ), which is given as v = 2 * 10⁸ m/s. The uncertainty in momentum is also along the x-direction (Δpₓ).\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n    Substitute the values of v and the calculated Δpₓ into the relationship from Step 3:\n    ΔE ≈ (2 * 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 * 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    ΔE ≈ 10.54 * 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    ΔE ≈ 1.054 * 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated value is ΔE ≈ 1.054 * 10⁻¹⁶ J.
