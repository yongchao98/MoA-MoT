    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information**\n\n*   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** This is considered the \"stationary\" frame of reference.\n*   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center moves towards it at `v = 60,000 km/s`. By the principle of relativity, the ejecta is also moving at this same speed relative to the Galaxy's frame.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame is given as `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's the time measured by a clock that is moving along with the ejecta.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The standard value is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Determine the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy reference frame (S)**. To find this distance (`d`), we need to use the formula:\n`d = v * Δt`\nwhere `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n**3. Apply the Concept of Time Dilation**\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, time passes differently in different inertial frames of reference. An observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for the event than the time interval measured in the moving frame (`Δt₀`). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n*   **Step 4a: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step 4b: Square the ratio.**\n    `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n\n*   **Step 4c: Calculate γ.**\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy Frame (Δt)**\n\nNow we can use the time dilation formula with the value of `γ` we just found.\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n`Δt = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**6. Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy Frame (d)**\n\nFinally, we can calculate the distance using the velocity `v` and the time `Δt` measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n`d = v * Δt`\n`d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n`d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\nTo get a numerical value:\n`√(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**7. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,060,000 km\n*   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 3,062,000 km is closest to option C.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Proper Time:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the 50 seconds is the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the frame of the moving object (the ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation:** A common mistake is to forget about time dilation and simply multiply the velocity by the given time (`60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`). This leads to the incorrect answer D. Because of time dilation, more time passes in the Galaxy's frame, so the distance traveled must be greater than 3,000,000 km.\n*   **Reference Frame for Distance:** The question specifically asks for the distance in the Galaxy's reference frame, which requires using the time elapsed in that same frame (`Δt`).\n\n<<<C>>>",
