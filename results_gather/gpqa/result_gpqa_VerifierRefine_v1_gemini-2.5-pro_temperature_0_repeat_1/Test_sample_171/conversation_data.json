    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem deals with the population of atoms in different energy levels within the photospheres of stars. The key assumption is that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation**, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy states as a function of temperature.\n\n**2. State the Boltzmann Equation**\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (let's call it state 'b') to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (state 'a'):\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[- (E_b - E_a) / (k * T) ]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_b`, `N_a` are the number of atoms in states 'b' and 'a'.\n*   `g_b`, `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n*   `E_b - E_a` is the energy difference between the states, which we can call `ΔE`.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n*   `exp` is the exponential function.\n\n**3. Apply the Boltzmann Equation to Each Star**\nWe need to write the equation for each star, using their respective temperatures, T_1 and T_2.\n\n*   **For star_1 (temperature T_1):**\n    The ratio of excited to lower-state atoms is:\n    (N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\n*   **For star_2 (temperature T_2):**\n    The ratio of excited to lower-state atoms is:\n    (N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n**Careful Point:** We are considering the *same* two energy levels of the *same* type of atom (iron) in both stars. Therefore, the energy difference `ΔE` and the statistical weights `g_b` and `g_a` are identical for both cases.\n\n**4. Incorporate the Observational Data**\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the population ratio in star_1 is two times the population ratio in star_2.\n\n(N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2\n\n**5. Combine and Simplify the Equations**\nNow, we substitute the Boltzmann expressions from Step 3 into the relationship from Step 4:\n\n(g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * { (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] }\n\n**Careful Point:** The term `(g_b / g_a)` appears on both sides and can be canceled out.\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n**6. Solve for the Relationship Between T_1 and T_2**\nTo isolate the temperatures, we need to eliminate the exponential functions by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides.\n\nln( exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] ) = ln( 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] )\n\nUsing the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln( exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] )\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to solve for `ln(2)`:\n\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T_2) - (1 / T_1) ]\n\nCombine the fractions inside the brackets by finding a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n**7. Use the Given Numerical Values**\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information:\n*   Energy difference, `ΔE` ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n*   Boltzmann constant, `k` ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n**Careful Point:** The ratio `ΔE / k` is therefore:\n`ΔE / k` ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our derived equation:\n\nln(2) = (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nIn the context of the multiple-choice answers, the unit (K) is implicitly handled, leaving the dimensionless form of the equation.\n\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n**8.
