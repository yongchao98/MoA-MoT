    "An analysis of the question and the provided statements is as follows:\n\n**The Core Concept: The Impulse Approximation**\n\nThe impulse approximation is a fundamental concept in nuclear scattering theory. It simplifies the complex problem of a projectile interacting with a nucleus containing many nucleons. The central idea is that the interaction happens so quickly (it's an \"impulse\") that it involves only a single nucleon. During this brief interaction time, the target nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle, momentarily unaffected by the forces binding it to the other nucleons.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Assumptions:**\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a foundational assumption. It posits that the total interaction can be treated as a sum of independent interactions with each nucleon. This simplification neglects more complex phenomena like meson-exchange currents (where the projectile interacts with the particles exchanged between nucleons) or interactions involving multiple nucleons at once. This is often called the \"additivity\" assumption.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a necessary assumption for the impulse approximation.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** This assumption deals with what happens *after* the initial interaction. The struck nucleon, as it exits the nucleus, could interact with the remaining \"spectator\" nucleons. These are known as \"final-state interactions\" (FSI). Assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" means we are ignoring FSI. For the struck nucleon to behave entirely like a free particle throughout the process (both during and after the interaction), this assumption is required. This leads to the simplest version of the theory, the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a necessary assumption to model the nucleon as completely free.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** This statement concerns the sub-structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, is a model that operates at the level of nucleons, treating them as the fundamental interacting particles. The internal dynamics of the quarks within the nucleon (whether they are relativistic or not) is a separate issue related to the model of the nucleon (e.g., its form factors), not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation itself.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is not a necessary assumption for the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the essence of the \"impulse\" concept. It assumes the interaction time is much shorter than the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nuclear potential. Consequently, during the brief moment of the collision, the binding potential is considered negligible. The nucleon interacts as a free particle with its instantaneous momentum, \"frozen\" at the moment of impact.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a necessary assumption for the impulse approximation.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\nTo approximate the interaction as one with a free nucleon, we must assume:\n*   The interaction is with a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n*   The nucleon is not affected by binding forces *during* the interaction (Statement 4).\n*   The nucleon is not affected by other nucleons *after* the interaction (Statement 2).\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
