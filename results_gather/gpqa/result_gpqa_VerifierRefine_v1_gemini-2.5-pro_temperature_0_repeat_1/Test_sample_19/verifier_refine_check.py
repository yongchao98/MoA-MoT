    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the impulse approximation question.

    The impulse approximation in nuclear physics rests on three main ideas:
    1. The interaction involves only one nucleon at a time (one-body current).
    2. The interaction is so fast that the binding potential is negligible during the event.
    3. The struck nucleon exits the nucleus without further interactions (no final-state interactions).

    Let's map these to the given statements:
    - Statement 1 ("...interacts with individual nucleons") matches idea 1.
    - Statement 2 ("...nucleus is transparent...") matches idea 3.
    - Statement 3 ("...quarks...are non-relativistic") is incorrect. The impulse approximation is about nucleon-level physics, not its internal quark structure. It can be applied in both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes.
    - Statement 4 ("...no binding forces") matches idea 2.

    Therefore, the correct set of assumptions is {1, 2, 4}.

An analysis of the question and the provided statements is as follows:

**The Core Concept: The Impulse Approximation**

The impulse approximation is a cornerstone of nuclear scattering theory. It simplifies a complex many-body problem (a projectile interacting with a nucleus of A nucleons) into a more manageable one. The central idea is that the interaction happens so quickly that it can be treated as a sudden "impulse" delivered to a single nucleon. During this brief moment, the target nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle, momentarily decoupled from the rest of the nucleus.

**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Assumptions:**

1.  **"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons."**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a fundamental premise of the impulse approximation. It assumes that the total interaction can be described as an incoherent sum of interactions with each of the individual nucleons. This neglects more complex scenarios, such as the projectile interacting with a pair of nucleons simultaneously or with the virtual mesons (like pions) being exchanged between nucleons. These are known as "two-body currents" or "meson-exchange currents." By assuming the interaction is with a single nucleon, we simplify the problem from a many-body interaction to a one-body interaction.
    *   **Conclusion:** This statement is a core assumption.

2.  **"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon."**
    *   **Analysis:** This statement addresses what happens *after* the initial interaction. If the struck nucleon (or any particles produced) has to travel out of the nucleus, it might interact with the other "spectator" nucleons on its way out. These are called "final-state interactions" (FSI). Assuming the nucleus is "transparent" means we are ignoring these FSI. This allows us to treat the outgoing nucleon's properties (like its momentum and energy) as if it had escaped from a free collision, without being altered by the nuclear environment. This specific version is often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA).
    *   **Conclusion:** This statement is a core assumption for the simplest form of the impulse approximation, which aims to treat the nucleon as completely free.

3.  **"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic."**
    *   **Analysis:** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, describing the behavior of its constituent quarks. The impulse approximation, however, operates at the level of nucleons, not quarks. It treats the nucleon as the fundamental entity. Whether the quarks inside are relativistic (as in high-energy deep inelastic scattering) or non-relativistic (as in some low-energy models) is a separate physical consideration related to the model of the nucleon, not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation itself. The impulse approximation can be applied in both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes.
    *   **Conclusion:** This statement is not a core assumption of the impulse approximation.

4.  **"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces."**
    *   **Analysis:** This is the "impulse" part of the approximation. The idea is that the interaction with the projectile is extremely fast compared to the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus. The nucleon is bound by the strong nuclear force, which can be described by a potential. This assumption states that during the brief instant of the collision, the effect of this binding potential is negligible. The nucleon is effectively "frozen" in its state of motion and interacts as a free particle with a given initial momentum, but without the influence of the binding force *during* the interaction.
    *   **Conclusion:** This statement is a core assumption.

**Synthesis:**

To make the approximation that a nucleon in a nucleus behaves like a free nucleon during an interaction, we need to assume:
*   The interaction targets only that single nucleon (Statement 1).
*   The binding forces are negligible during the short interaction time (Statement 4).
*   The nucleon can exit the nucleus without further disturbance (Statement 2).

Therefore, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.
