    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Neutrino Sources:** The Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction pathways. We need to identify which reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands. The main sources are:\n    *   **pp-I chain:** Produces `pp` neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum up to 420 keV. These are below both energy bands in the question.\n    *   **pp-II chain:** Produces mono-energetic `⁷Be` neutrinos. About 90% of these have an energy of **861 keV**, and the other 10% have 384 keV. The 861 keV line falls directly into **band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n    *   **pp-III chain:** Produces `⁸B` neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum up to about 15 MeV. These neutrinos contribute to the flux in **both band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n    *   **CNO cycle:** Produces neutrinos from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays, with continuous spectra up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. These neutrinos also contribute to the flux in **both band 1 and band 2**.\n\n2.  **Apply the Hypothetical Scenario:** The question states that the **pp-III branch stops**. This means the production of `⁸B` neutrinos ceases. All other reactions, including the pp-II chain and the CNO cycle, continue as normal. The change happened ~8.5 minutes ago, which is the travel time for neutrinos from the Sun to Earth, so we are observing the immediate effect of this change.\n\n3.  **Determine the Remaining Flux in Each Band:** After the pp-III branch stops, we need to see what sources are left for each energy band.\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos: Gone.\n        *   `⁷Be` neutrinos: Not in this band (they are at 861 keV).\n        *   `CNO` neutrinos: **Yes**, their continuous spectrum covers this range.\n        *   *Conclusion for Band 1:* The only remaining source of neutrinos is the CNO cycle.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos: Gone.\n        *   `⁷Be` neutrinos: **Yes**, the very strong 861 keV line is in this band. This reaction is part of the pp-II chain, which is unaffected.\n        *   `CNO` neutrinos: **Yes**, their continuous spectrum also covers this range.\n        *   *Conclusion for Band 2:* The remaining sources are the `⁷Be` neutrinos and the `CNO` neutrinos.\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes of the Remaining Fluxes (Approximate Analysis):** To find the ratio, we need to compare the strength of the fluxes in each band.\n    *   **Flux in Band 2:** This band contains the mono-energetic 861 keV `⁷Be` line. The flux of this line is very large, approximately 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s. The contribution from the continuous CNO spectrum in this narrow 100 keV band is much smaller. Therefore, the total flux in band 2 is overwhelmingly dominated by the `⁷Be` neutrinos.\n        *   `Flux(band 2) ≈ Flux(⁷Be line)`\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 1:** This band's flux comes only from the CNO cycle. The total flux of all CNO neutrinos (summed over their entire energy spectrum) is about 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s. This is already about 10 times smaller than the `⁷Be` line flux.\n        *   `Total Flux(CNO) ≈ 0.1 * Flux(⁷Be line)`\n\n    *   Furthermore, the flux in band 1 is only a small fraction of the *total* CNO flux, because the CNO flux is spread out over a wide energy range (up to ~1.7 MeV). The band is only 100 keV (0.1 MeV) wide. As an order-of-magnitude estimate, the fraction of the total CNO flux that falls into this band is roughly the ratio of the bandwidth to the total spectrum width (e.g., 0.1 MeV / 1 MeV ≈ 0.1).\n        *   `Flux(band 1) = Flux(CNO in 100 keV band) ≈ 0.1 * Total Flux(CNO)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Now we can combine these approximations to find the ratio.\n    *   Ratio = `Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2)`\n    *   Substitute the approximations from step 4:\n        Ratio ≈ `(0.1 * Total Flux(CNO)) / Flux(⁷Be line)`\n    *   Now substitute the relationship between the total CNO flux and the `⁷Be` flux:\n        Ratio ≈ `(0.1 * (0.1 * Flux(⁷Be line))) / Flux(⁷Be line)`\n    *   The `Flux(⁷Be line)` terms cancel out:\n        Ratio ≈ `0.1 * 0.1`\n        Ratio ≈ `0.01`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The key is to correctly identify which neutrino sources contribute to which energy bands.\n*   It is crucial to recognize that the pp-II chain (producing `⁷Be` neutrinos) is *not* affected by the pp-III branch stopping.\n*   The problem requires an *approximate* ratio, so order-of-magnitude estimations based on the relative strengths of the different neutrino fluxes are sufficient and intended.\n*   The `⁷Be` source is a sharp, mono-energetic line, making its contribution to band 2 very strong and concentrated. The CNO sources are continuous spectra, so their flux is spread out, and only a small fraction falls into band 1.\n*   The ratio of the total CNO flux to the `⁷Be` line flux is about 0.1. The ratio of the band 1 CNO flux to the total CNO flux is also about 0.1. Multiplying these factors gives the final approximate ratio.\n\nThe flux in band 1 becomes very small (a fraction of the CNO flux), while the flux in band 2 remains very large (dominated by the `⁷Be` line). The ratio is therefore approximately 0.01.\n\n<<<C>>>",
