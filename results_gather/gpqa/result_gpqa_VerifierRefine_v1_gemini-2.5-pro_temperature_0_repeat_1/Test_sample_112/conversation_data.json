    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a key feature. A broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Careful Point:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a C=O stretch around 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ confirms an additional C=C bond elsewhere in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these peaks confirms the existence of an alkene, which corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Careful Point:** This piece of data reinforces the conclusion from the FTIR that the molecule contains a C=C double bond.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as: 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45. The observation of a fragment with m/z = 45 is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid, as this [COOH]⁺ fragment is commonly formed.\n\n**Careful Point:** This mass spectrometry data provides independent and strong confirmation of the carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three spectra, we can conclude that the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid**, meaning it contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given chemical formulas:\n\n1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n2.  We are left with B (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2). To distinguish between them, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n    *   Our compound has one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means it must have a **DoU of 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **B) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our findings (one C=O and one C=C).\n\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This DoU of 1 would only account for the C=O of the carboxylic acid, but not the additional C=C double bond. A compound with this formula would be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) or a saturated ester.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe only formula that fits all the evidence—the presence of two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and a degree of unsaturation of 2 for the C=O and C=C bonds—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
