    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks for a factor representing the change in the ratio of atom populations in two energy levels. Specifically, it asks for the ratio (N₂/N₁) without spots divided by the ratio (N₂/N₁) with spots.\n    *   Let `Ratio_nospots = (N₂/N₁)_nospots`\n    *   Let `Ratio_spots = (N₂/N₁)_spots`\n    *   We need to calculate `Factor = Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Principle:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the number of atoms in different energy levels is therefore described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n    *   N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n    *   Where:\n        *   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the higher energy level (2) and lower energy level (1), respectively.\n        *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels, which are constant for a given atom.\n        *   E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels (ΔE).\n        *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n        *   T is the temperature of the photosphere.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Factor:** We can write the expressions for the two scenarios:\n    *   `Ratio_nospots = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)]`\n    *   `Ratio_spots = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]`\n\n    The factor we need to find is:\n    *   `Factor = Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)] ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)] ]`\n    *   The statistical weight term (g₂/g₁) cancels out:\n    *   `Factor = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]`\n    *   Using the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n    *   `Factor = exp[ -ΔE/k * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]`\n\n4.  **Identify the Temperatures (Careful Point):**\n    *   The temperature of the unspotted star is given directly: `T_nospots = 6000 K`.\n    *   When the star has spots, its *overall effective temperature* is `5500 K`. The problem is asking how the observed ratio changes. The observed ratio from the entire star is best represented by the overall effective temperature. Therefore, we should use this value as the temperature for the spotted case.\n    *   `T_spots = 5500 K`.\n    *   The other information (radius, mass, 40% spot coverage) is context to make the problem physically realistic but is not needed for the calculation if we use the given effective temperatures.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):**\n    *   The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, λ = 1448 Å.\n    *   ΔE = h * c / λ\n    *   Constants:\n        *   h (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s\n        *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m = 1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m\n    *   ΔE = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s) / (1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.373 × 10⁻¹⁸ J\n\n6.  **Calculate the Term ΔE/k:**\n    *   It is often easier to calculate the term ΔE/k together.\n    *   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   ΔE/k ≈ (1.373 × 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99420 K.\n    *   *(Alternative, often more precise method using eV)*:\n        *   ΔE = hc/λ = (1240 eV·nm) / (144.8 nm) ≈ 8.563 eV\n        *   k ≈ 8.617 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n        *   ΔE/k ≈ 8.563 eV / (8.617 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99380 K. We will use this value for better precision.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Factor:**\n    *   Now, substitute the values into the factor equation:\n    *   `Factor = exp[ - (ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]`\n    *   `Factor = exp[ -99380 * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]`\n    *   First, calculate the term in the parenthesis:\n    *   (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (11/66000 - 12/66000) = -1 / 66000 K⁻¹\n    *   Now, substitute this back into the exponent:\n    *   Exponent = -99380 * (-1 / 66000) = 99380 / 66000 ≈ 1.5058\n    *   Finally, calculate the factor:\n    *   `Factor = exp(1.5058) ≈ 4.507`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This means the ratio of (N₂/N₁) is about 4.5 times higher in the unspotted star (at 6000 K) compared to the overall state of the spotted star (at an effective temperature of 5500 K). This matches option C.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n<<<C>>>",
