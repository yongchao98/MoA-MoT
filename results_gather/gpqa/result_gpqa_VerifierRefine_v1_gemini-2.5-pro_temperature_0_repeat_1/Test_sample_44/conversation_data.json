    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the System and its Properties:**\n    *   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are **fermions**.\n    *   **Governing Principle:** Fermions obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n    *   **Quantum State:** A quantum state for a particle in this system is defined by its spatial quantum number `n` (for the energy level) and its spin quantum number `m_s` (spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n    *   **Implication:** Due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each spatial energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n2.  **Determine the Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The system is a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n    *   The energy for a single particle in the n-th level is given by the formula:\n        `E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)` where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n    *   The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    *   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed in terms of E:\n        *   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = E`\n        *   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n        *   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n        *   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n        *   and so on.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    *   The ground state is the lowest possible total energy configuration for the four-particle system.\n    *   To achieve this, we fill the single-particle energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the limit of two particles per level.\n    *   **Level n=1 (Energy E):** Place the first two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** Place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:** Sum the energies of all four particles.\n        `E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = (2 * E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited):**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest possible energy. This is achieved by making the smallest possible energy \"jump\" from the ground state configuration.\n    *   The lowest energy promotion involves moving one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n    *   **Ground State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n    *   **First Excited State Configuration:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. The new configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, and 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n        `E_1st_excited = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider different possible promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from a lower level (n=1) to the next available level (n=3).\n        *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n        *   Energy: `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 0 particles in n=2, 2 particles in n=3.\n        *   Energy: `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n        *   Energy: `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the second lowest energy after the ground state is 18E.\n    *   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** `E_2nd_excited = 18E`\n\n### Summary of Energies\n\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Fermions vs. Bosons:** The most critical point is recognizing that spin-1/2 particles are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
