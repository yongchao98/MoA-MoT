    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Gas W and Substance B**\n*   The problem states that gas W has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple diatomic gases:\n    *   H₂ (¹H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   D₂ (²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p = n). This is a strong candidate. D is deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   N₂ (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n).\n    *   O₂ (¹⁶O₂): 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (p = n).\n*   The problem states that a precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B, whose melting point is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is a very close match. Therefore, substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n*   Since B is D₂O, it strongly supports the idea that deuterium is involved. This makes **W = D₂ (deuterium gas)** the most likely candidate for the gas.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance X, Liquid Y, and Precipitate G**\n*   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. We've established this is likely deuterium (D).\n*   X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. Heating G produces D₂O.\n*   For G to produce D₂O upon heating, it must be a deuterated hydroxide that dehydrates (or de-deuterates). A common example is Al(OH)₃ decomposing to Al₂O₃ and H₂O. The deuterated analog, Al(OD)₃, would decompose to Al₂O₃ and D₂O. So, **G is likely Al(OD)₃**, which is a precipitate.\n*   The reaction is: X + Y → D₂(g) + Al(OD)₃(s) + other products.\n*   To produce D₂ and Al(OD)₃, a logical choice for X is a powerful deuteride reducing agent, and for Y is D₂O.\n*   Let's test **X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride)** and **Y = D₂O (heavy water)**.\n    *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂ (gas).\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   It produces gas W = D₂ (p=n).\n    *   It forms precipitate G = Al(OD)₃.\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) releases B = D₂O.\n    *   This set of substances fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Verify with the remaining clues**\n*   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms.\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   R-C(=O)-R'-COOH --(1. LiAlD₄ / 2. Workup)--> R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂(OH).\n    *   The product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This clue is satisfied.\n*   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   The very close analog of X (LiAlD₄) is LiAlH₄ (Lithium Aluminium Hydride).\n    *   LiAlH₄ is one of the most common and powerful reducing agents used in organic synthesis. This clue is also satisfied.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer**\n*   We have confidently identified Substance **X as LiAlD₄**.\n*   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. We must also consider the clause: \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   Based on atomic number (Z), the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in the formula LiAlD₄. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation as the options are integers.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of hydrogen, present as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass of the lightest element = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium. The most stable and common isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass of the heaviest element = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Atomic Mass** = (Total mass of lightest element's atoms) + (Total mass of heaviest element's atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
