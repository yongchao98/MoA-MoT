    # Adamantan-2-one -> [MPV Reduction] -> Adamantan-2-ol (P2)

    # --- Step 4: Check the Final NMR Analysis ---
    # The LLM analyzes the NMR spectrum of the proposed Product 3: adamantane-2,5-diol.
    # It correctly identifies the proton at C2 as the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.
    # It correctly identifies that this H2 is coupled to its vicinal neighbors, H1 and H3.

    # CRITICAL CHECK: The LLM claims H1 and H3 are equivalent.
    # Let's validate this claim based on the structure of adamantane-2,5-diol.
    # In the parent adamantan-2-ol, a plane of symmetry makes H1 and H3 equivalent.
    # However, adding a hydroxyl group at C5 (a bridgehead) breaks this symmetry.
    # The C5-OH group is in a different spatial relationship to C1 than it is to C3.
    # Therefore, H1 and H3 are chemically non-equivalent (they are diastereotopic).
