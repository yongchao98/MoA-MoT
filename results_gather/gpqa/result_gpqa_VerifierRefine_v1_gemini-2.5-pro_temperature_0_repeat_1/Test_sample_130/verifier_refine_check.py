def check_answer():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by codifying the chemical principles
    involved in the problem.

    The logic flow is as follows:
    1.  Identify Reactants: Verify the structures of the dienophile (maleic anhydride) and the diene from the problem description.
    2.  Analyze Reaction & Stereochemistry: Confirm the reaction is a Diels-Alder and determine the major product (*exo* or *endo*) based on steric hindrance, which is a known exception to the endo rule in this case.
    3.  Predict Proton Signals: Assign the described NMR signals to the protons in the product structure.
    4.  Analyze NOESY Data: Based on the 3D structure of the major product, predict which protons will be close in space and thus show a NOESY cross-peak.
    5.  Compare with Options: Match the predicted NOESY correlation to the given multiple-choice options.
    6.  Final Verdict: Check if the LLM's answer matches the derived correct option.
