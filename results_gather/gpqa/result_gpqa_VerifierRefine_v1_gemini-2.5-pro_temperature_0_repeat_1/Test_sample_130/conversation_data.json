    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A single ¹H peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The 7 ppm shift is in the vinylic region.\n    *   Two ¹³C peaks indicate two types of carbons. 137 ppm is typical for alkene carbons (C=C), and 165 ppm is typical for anhydride carbonyl carbons (C=O).\n    *   The molecule that fits this description perfectly is **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent vinylic protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons), consistent with the NMR data. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (a cis-dicarboxylic acid).\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the conjugated system and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product. The question states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n*   **The Endo Rule and Steric Hindrance:** Typically, the *endo* product is the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital overlap. However, this rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance.\n*   In this specific case, the diene has methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions. In the *endo* transition state, these methyl groups would clash severely with the incoming anhydride ring. In the *exo* transition state, the anhydride is oriented away from these methyl groups, minimizing steric repulsion.\n*   Therefore, due to this significant steric hindrance, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *endo* adduct**. This is a known exception to the general endo rule.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structures and Predict ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nLet's visualize the products and predict the chemical shifts of their protons. Both products have a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Protons H(C5)/H(6):** These are the two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and are deshielded. They are equivalent by symmetry.\n    *   *Prediction:* A 2H singlet around **~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons Me(C2)/Me(C3):** These are the two methyl groups on the double bond. They are equivalent by symmetry.\n    *   *Prediction:* A 6H singlet around **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons Me(C1)/Me(C4):** These are the two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They are on saturated, quaternary carbons and are relatively shielded. They are equivalent by symmetry.\n    *   *Prediction:* A 6H singlet around **~1.0 ppm**.\n*   **Bridge Protons H(C7):** These are the two protons on the C7 methylene bridge. They are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the double bond, one is *anti*). They will have different chemical shifts and will couple to each other, appearing as two doublets (an AB system).\n    *   *Prediction:* Two 1H signals around **~1.5 ppm**. The options simplify this by referring to one of them as a \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\".\n\n**Step 4: Use NOESY to Differentiate the Isomers**\n\nNOESY shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). We are looking for a cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product.\n\n*   **In the *endo* adduct (minor product):** The anhydride ring is folded \"under\" the C2-C3 double bond. This brings the H(C5)/H(6) protons very close to the vinylic methyl groups Me(C2)/Me(C3). A strong NOE cross-peak between the signal at ~3.5 ppm (H(C5)/H(6)) and ~1.7 ppm (Me(C2)/Me(C3)) would be expected. This corresponds to option D. Since this is characteristic of the *minor* product, it's the opposite of what the question asks.\n\n*   **In the *exo* adduct (major product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"away\" from the C2-C3 double bond.\n    *   The H(C5)/H(6) protons are now far from the vinylic methyls Me(C2)/Me(C3), so the NOE described above would be absent.\n    *   Instead, the H(C5)/H(6) protons are brought close to other protons. Specifically, they are close to the *anti*-proton on the C7 bridge (H(C7-anti)). This proximity is unique to the *exo* isomer. In the *endo* isomer, the H(C5)/H(6) protons are on the opposite face of the molecule from H(C7-anti).\n    *   Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between **H(C5)/H(6)** and **H(C7-anti)** will be present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Analysis to the Options**\n\n*   The key NOE for the major (*exo*) product is between H(C5)/H(6) and H(C7-anti).\n*   Let's match these protons to the signals described in the options:\n    *   H(C5)/H(6) corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   H(C7-anti) corresponds to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   The option that connects these two resonances is A.\n\n*   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This matches our analysis for the major (*exo*) product.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: Correlation between the two sets of methyl groups. Unlikely to be the key differentiating peak.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: Correlation between bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton. Plausible, but the correlation in A is a more distinct feature for differentiating *exo* from *endo*.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This is the characteristic correlation for the *minor* (*endo*) product.\n\nThe correct answer is the one that describes the NOE unique to the major (*exo*) product.\n\n<<<A>>>",
