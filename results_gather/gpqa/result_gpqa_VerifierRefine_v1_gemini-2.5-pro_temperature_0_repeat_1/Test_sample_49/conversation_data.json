    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the given expression**\n\nThe expression provided is: `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`.\nTo find the number of loops, we need to identify which part of this expression is directly related to the loop structure of a Feynman diagram in a four-dimensional quantum field theory.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key components and their significance**\n\n*   **`alpha^3 * g^2`**: These are coupling constants. `alpha` is the fine-structure constant, and `g` is another coupling constant. The power of the coupling constants indicates the number of interaction vertices in the diagram. In this case, there are `3 + 2 = 5` vertices. While related to the diagram's complexity, this doesn't directly give the number of loops.\n*   **`sqrt(2) * 8`**: These are dimensionless numerical factors. They typically arise from group theory calculations (e.g., SU(N) color factors), symmetry factors of the diagram, or the results of specific integrations. They do not determine the number of loops.\n*   **`(Q/M)^2`**: This is a ratio of two energy scales, `Q` and `M`. Such terms, often appearing inside logarithms like `log(Q^2/M^2)`, are characteristic results of loop calculations after regularization and renormalization. They indicate that a loop calculation has been performed, but the power `2` is not the loop number itself.\n*   **`1/(4pi)^6`**: This is the most crucial term for our analysis. In quantum field theory, calculations involving loops require integrating over the momentum of the virtual particles circulating in the loop. This is called a loop integral.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the loop factor**\n\nIn a quantum field theory set in `d` spacetime dimensions, each loop integral over an internal momentum `k` (of the form `∫ d^d k / (2pi)^d`) contributes a characteristic factor to the final amplitude.\n\n*   For a theory in **four-dimensional spacetime** (`d=4`), after performing the integration over the angular components in momentum space (a procedure known as Wick rotation followed by integration in 4D spherical coordinates), each loop systematically produces a factor of `1/(16π^2)`.\n*   This factor can be rewritten as `1/(4pi)^2`.\n*   Therefore, a Feynman diagram with `L` loops will have a factor of `(1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^(2L)` in its amplitude.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of loops (L)**\n\nWe can now compare the general formula for the loop factor with the one present in the scribbled note.\n\n*   General factor for `L` loops: `1/(4pi)^(2L)`\n*   Factor from the note: `1/(4pi)^6`\n\nBy equating the exponents, we get:\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L`:\n`L = 6 / 2`\n`L = 3`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the `(4pi)` factor, which is a standard result of loop integration in 4D spacetime, unambiguously shows that the calculation was for a diagram with 3 loops. The other terms in the expression are consistent with a 3-loop, 5-vertex diagram but are not as direct for counting the loops.\n\n<<<D>>>",
