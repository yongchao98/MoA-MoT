    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the Feynman diagram loop question.

    The core principle is that in a d=4 dimensional spacetime, each loop integral
    in a Feynman diagram calculation contributes a factor of 1/(16*pi^2), which
    can be written as 1/((4*pi)^2).

    Therefore, a diagram with L loops will have a factor of (1/(4*pi)^2)^L = 1/(4*pi)^(2*L).

    We can find the number of loops (L) by inspecting the exponent in the given expression.
