    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** trans-cinnamaldehyde.\n    *   The structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO. The C₆H₅ group is a phenyl ring.\n    *   Let's count the carbon atoms: 6 carbons in the phenyl ring, 2 carbons in the -CH=CH- group, and 1 carbon in the aldehyde (-CHO) group.\n    *   Total carbons in trans-cinnamaldehyde = 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 carbons.\n*   **Reagent:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr), a Grignard reagent.\n*   **Reaction:** Grignard reagents are strong nucleophiles. They react with aldehydes via nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl carbon (this is called 1,2-addition). The methyl group (CH₃) from the Grignard reagent adds to the carbonyl carbon, and after an aqueous workup (implied), the carbonyl oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Product 1:** The aldehyde group (-CHO) is converted to a secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)CH₃). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃.\n*   **Carbon Count Analysis:** The reaction adds one carbon atom from the methyl group of methylmagnesium bromide.\n    *   Carbon atoms in Product 1 = 9 (from cinnamaldehyde) + 1 (from CH₃MgBr) = 10 carbons.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃), which is a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC).\n*   **Reaction:** PCC is a mild oxidizing agent that specifically oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones. It does not affect other functional groups present, such as the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)CH₃) is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)CH₃).\n    *   Structure of Product 2: C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃ (This compound is known as benzalacetone).\n*   **Carbon Count Analysis:** Oxidation is a process that changes the bonds to oxygen and hydrogen but does not add or remove carbon atoms from the molecular skeleton.\n    *   Carbon atoms in Product 2 = Carbon atoms in Product 1 = 10 carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃), which is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane is the IUPAC name for dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, (CH₃)₂S(=O)CH₂. This is a sulfur ylide used in the Corey-Chaykovsky reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** This specific ylide reacts with ketones to form epoxides. It adds a methylene group (CH₂) to the carbonyl carbon, forming a three-membered ring containing oxygen (an epoxide or oxirane). For α,β-unsaturated ketones, this ylide preferentially attacks the carbonyl carbon (1,2-addition) rather than the double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone group is converted into an epoxide ring.\n    *   Structure of Product 3: The C=O group is replaced by a C-O-CH₂ ring.\n*   **Carbon Count Analysis:** The reaction adds one carbon atom from the methylene group (CH₂) of the ylide.\n    *   Carbon atoms in Product 3 = 10 (from Product 2) + 1 (from the ylide) = 11 carbons.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary:**\n*   Carbons in starting material (trans-cinnamaldehyde): 9\n*   Carbons after Step 1 (+CH₃MgBr): 9 + 1 = 10\n*   Carbons after Step 2 (+PCC): 10 + 0 = 10\n*   Carbons after Step 3 (+(CH₃)₂S(O)CH₂): 10 + 1 = 11\n\nThe final product, Product 3, has 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>",
