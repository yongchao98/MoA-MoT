    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis and the determination of the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents, while not the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) conditions, is designed to achieve the alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid. The reaction replaces a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group (the alpha-carbon) with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid.\n    *   Structure: Br-CH2-COOH\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   Structure: Br-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-), a good nucleophile, attacks the primary carbon bearing the bromine atom, which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   Structure: NC-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence involving deprotonation and alkylation, leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes one of the acidic alpha-hydrogens from the carbon between the nitrile (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na+[NC-CH-COOEt]- + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining, still acidic, alpha-hydrogen on the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na+[NC-C(-)(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br] + H2\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion on the alpha-carbon attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This intramolecular SN2 reaction forms a stable six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of all hydrogen atoms in the molecule 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Molecule:**\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is attached to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOC2H5), the C2 of the ring, and the C6 of the ring.\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group is not symmetric. Therefore, there is no plane of symmetry in the molecule.\n    *   The absence of a plane of symmetry means that C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   Consequently, ring carbons C2 and C6 are not chemically equivalent, and carbons C3 and C5 are not chemically equivalent.\n\n2.  **Dynamic Effects (Chair Flip):**\n    *   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-to-chair interconversion. This process is fast on the NMR timescale.\n    *   The rapid flipping averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons on any single carbon atom. So, the two protons on C2 will give a single, time-averaged signal. The same applies to C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n\n3.  **Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   Since C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all chemically distinct environments, each CH2 group will produce a unique signal.\n        *   Signal 1: 2 protons on C2 (time-averaged).\n        *   Signal 2: 2 protons on C3 (time-averaged).\n        *   Signal 3: 2 protons on C4 (time-averaged).\n        *   Signal 4: 2 protons on C5 (time-averaged).\n        *   Signal 5: 2 protons on C6 (time-averaged).\n        *   This gives a total of **5 distinct signals** from the ring protons.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3) Protons:**\n        *   The ethyl group is attached to the chiral center C1 (via the ester linkage).\n        *   **Methylene Protons (-O-CH2-):** Because these two protons are adjacent to a chiral center, they are diastereotopic. This means they are in chemically different environments and are non-equivalent. They will produce **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation around the C-C bond. They will produce **1 distinct signal**.\n        *   This gives a total of 2 + 1 = **3 distinct signals** from the ethyl group.\n\n4.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Total Signals = (Signals from ring) + (Signals from ethyl group)\n    *   Total Signals = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>",
