    This function programmatically checks the reasoning for a multi-step synthesis
    and subsequent 1H NMR analysis problem.

    It verifies two main parts:
    1. The chemical structure of the final product based on the reaction sequence.
    2. The number of distinct proton signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of that product,
       based on molecular symmetry and chemical environment rules.

    # --- Part 1: Verification of the Final Product's Structure ---
    # The problem describes the following synthesis:
    # 1. Acetic acid + (Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride) -> Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid)
    #    - This is an alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. The deduction is correct.
    # 2. Product 1 + (Ethanol, H2SO4) -> Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate)
    #    - This is a standard Fischer esterification. The deduction is correct.
    # 3. Product 2 + NaCN -> Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)
    #    - This is a standard SN2 reaction where cyanide displaces bromide. The deduction is correct.
    # 4. Product 3 + (excess NaH, 1,5-dibromopentane) -> Product 4
    #    - This is a double alkylation leading to cyclization. The acidic alpha-proton of ethyl
    #      cyanoacetate is removed by NaH. The resulting enolate attacks one end of
    #      1,5-dibromopentane. The excess NaH removes the remaining alpha-proton, and the
    #      new carbanion performs an intramolecular SN2 reaction to form a 6-membered ring.
    #    - The final product is correctly identified as 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.

    # --- Part 2: Verification of the 1H NMR Signal Count for Product 4 ---
    # The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.

    # 2a. Symmetry Analysis
    # The carbon at position 1 (C1) of the cyclohexane ring is attached to four different groups:
    # -CN, -COOCH2CH3, and the two distinct pathways around the ring.
    # Therefore, C1 is a chiral center, and the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry.
    has_plane_of_symmetry = False

    # 2b. Counting Signals from the Cyclohexane Ring
    # Because there is no plane of symmetry, the ring protons are not equivalent across the ring.
    # - The CH2 group at C2 is not equivalent to the CH2 group at C6.
    # - The CH2 group at C3 is not equivalent to the CH2 group at C5.
    # - The CH2 group at C4 is unique.
    # This gives 5 chemically distinct CH2 groups.
    # Assuming standard NMR conditions (room temperature), rapid chair-flipping averages the
    # axial and equatorial protons on each of these carbons, so each CH2 group gives one signal.
    num_ring_signals = 5

    # 2c. Counting Signals from the Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3)
    # This group is attached to a chiral center (C1) via the ester linkage.
    # - Methylene protons (-O-CH2-): These two protons are diastereotopic because they are
    #   adjacent to a chiral center. They are chemically non-equivalent and give two separate signals.
    num_methylene_signals = 2
    # - Methyl protons (-CH3): The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation.
    #   They give one signal.
    num_methyl_signals = 1
    
    num_ethyl_group_signals = num_methylene_signals + num_methyl_signals

    # 2d. Total Signal Count
