    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying Compound A (Tautomerism)**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Understanding Tautomerism.** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in dynamic equilibrium and can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an alpha-carbon, which is the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze Benzoquinone.**\n    *   The structure of 1,4-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at opposite ends and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized.\n    *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon, benzoquinone cannot undergo the typical keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   These carbons (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons to the carbonyl groups. They are sp³ hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   Because it has alpha-hydrogens, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and very stable compound. The equilibrium strongly favors the enol form, but the tautomerism (the interconversion) does exist.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part 1:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying Compound B (Optical Isomerism)**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Understanding Optical Isomerism.** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reason for chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Dimethyl fumarate.**\n    *   The structure is the trans-isomer of an alkene with a methyl ester group on each carbon of the double bond: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Molecules with a center of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part 2:** The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
