    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Physical System**\nThe system consists of a point charge `q` and a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0). The point charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`. The presence of the charge `q` induces a distribution of charge on the surface of the conducting sphere. We need to find the total potential energy stored in this configuration.\n\n**2. Apply the Method of Images**\nThis problem is best solved using the method of images. The effect of the induced charges on the surface of the grounded sphere can be perfectly replicated (for the region outside the sphere) by placing a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere.\n\n*   **Goal:** We need to find the magnitude `q'` and position `b` (distance from the center) of this image charge such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `r=R`) is zero.\n*   **Setup:** Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The real charge `q` is at `z=d`. The image charge `q'` is placed at `z=b` along the same axis.\n*   **Calculation:** The potential at any point on the surface of the sphere must be zero.\n    *   Potential due to real charge `q`: `V_q = kq / (distance from q)`\n    *   Potential due to image charge `q'`: `V_q' = kq' / (distance from q')`\n    *   The condition is `V_q + V_q' = 0` for all points on the sphere's surface.\n*   **Results:** Through standard derivation, the image charge required to satisfy this boundary condition is:\n    *   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center)\n\n**3. Calculate the Potential Energy**\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\n*   **Common Pitfall:** One might be tempted to calculate the potential energy as the simple interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. This is incorrect. The image charge is not a real, fixed charge; its magnitude and position depend on the location of the real charge `q`.\n*   **Correct Method 1: Using Work Done**\n    The energy is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. The force on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by the induced charges, which is equivalent to the force from the image charge.\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    The potential energy `U` is the integral of the external force (`-F(x)`) from infinity to `d`.\n    `U = ∫(from ∞ to d) -F(x) dx = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    Solving this integral gives: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   **Correct Method 2: Using Potential (`U = 1/2 * qV`)**\n    A more direct method is to use the formula for the energy of a charge distribution. The total energy `U` is given by `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges.\n    In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the induced surface charge on the sphere.\n    `U = (1/2) * [q * V_induced_at_q + ∫(sphere) σ * V_on_sphere dS]`\n    *   `V_on_sphere` is 0 because the sphere is grounded. So the second term is zero.\n    *   `V_induced_at_q` is the potential at the location of the real charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. This potential is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    *   `V_induced_at_q = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   Distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n    *   `V_induced_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d) = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Now, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced_at_q = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Grounded Condition:** The V=0 condition on the sphere is the key to the problem. For an isolated, uncharged sphere, the problem would be different (requiring a second image charge at the center).\n2.  **The 1/2 Factor:** The factor of 1/2 is crucial and comes from the fact that the induced charge distribution is not a fixed source but is created by the presence of the charge `q`. The energy is stored in the field, and this formula correctly accounts for it, avoiding double-counting.\n3.  **Attractive Force:** Since `d > R`, the term `(d^2 - R^2)` is positive. The entire expression for `U` is negative. This is physically correct, as the charge `q` induces opposite charges on the near side of the sphere, resulting in a net attractive force. The potential energy of an attractive system is negative.\n4.  **Dimensionality Check:** The expression `k*q^2/distance` has units of energy. Our result is `k*q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`, which has units of `(Energy * Length) * Length / (Length^2) = Energy`. The units are correct.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBased on the analysis, the net potential energy of the system is:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)  (Incorrect, has R²)\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)   (Incorrect numerator and denominator)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)  (Correct)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)         (Incorrect, missing 1/2 and has d instead of R)\n\nThe calculated expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
