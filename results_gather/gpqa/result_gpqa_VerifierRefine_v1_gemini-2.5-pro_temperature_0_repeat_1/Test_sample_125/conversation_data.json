    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Stereochemistry of Starting Materials:** Identify if the starting materials are chiral or achiral.\n2.  **Nature of the Reaction:** Understand how the reagents (LAH, NaBH4) affect the functional groups (ketones).\n3.  **Creation of New Stereocenters:** Determine if the reactions create new chiral centers.\n4.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** Predict the stereoisomers formed (enantiomers, diastereomers, meso compounds) and their relationships.\n5.  **Principles of HPLC Separation:**\n    *   **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral):** Separates compounds based on polarity. It can separate diastereomers but cannot separate enantiomers.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** Uses a chiral stationary phase to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n6.  **Combined Mixture:** The final analysis is on the combined products of both reactions. We must assume that structurally distinct molecules (e.g., products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) and diastereomers will not accidentally have the same retention time.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5) and is therefore chiral.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula but different spatial arrangements. One stereocenter is the same ((S) at C5) while the other is different ((R) vs. (S) at C3). This makes them **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetric and achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4). This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. We must consider all possible stereoisomers. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). This is a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The reaction starts with an achiral molecule and produces all possible stereoisomers. Therefore, the products are a mixture of three compounds:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound)\n    The two enantiomers will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture. The meso compound is a diastereomer of each of the enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture on Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them, giving **1 peak**.\n    *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   Thus, the products from Reaction II give a total of **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7 compounds) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 compounds) and will elute at different times.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture on Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC separates both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The meso compound is achiral and will give **1 peak**.\n    *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will be separated by the chiral column, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   Thus, the products from Reaction II give a total of **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Again, assuming no accidental overlap between the two sets of products.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 3 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
