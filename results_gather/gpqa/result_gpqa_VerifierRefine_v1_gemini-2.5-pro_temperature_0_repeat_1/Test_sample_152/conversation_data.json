NaOEt is a strong base that will deprotonate the dimethyl malonate.\n\n2.  **Step-by-step Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Formation of the Nucleophile.** The ethoxide ion (`EtO-`) from NaOEt removes an acidic α-proton from dimethyl malonate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion.\n        `CH2(COOCH3)2 + NaOEt  ⇌  Na+ [-CH(COOCH3)2] + EtOH`\n    *   **Step 2: Conjugate Addition (Michael Addition).** The malonate enolate `[-CH(COOCH3)2]` acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The π electrons shift to form a new enolate intermediate.\n        `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH3 + [-CH(COOCH3)2]  →  p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH=C(O-)OCH3` (resonance-stabilized enolate)\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol (EtOH), to yield the final neutral product (A).\n        `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH=C(O-)OCH3 + EtOH  →  p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH2-COOCH3 + EtO-`\n\n3.  **Identify Product (A):**\n    *   The final product is `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n    *   Let's analyze the name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n        *   Propane backbone: C1-C2-C3.\n        *   Substituents: two `COOCH3` groups at C1, one `p-tolyl` group at C2, and one `COOCH3` group at C3.\n        *   Structure from name: `(CH3OOC)2CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH2COOCH3`.\n    *   This structure matches the one derived from the reaction mechanism.
