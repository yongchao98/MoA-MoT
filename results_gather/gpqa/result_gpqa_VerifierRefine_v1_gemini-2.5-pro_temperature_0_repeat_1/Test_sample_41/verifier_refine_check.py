    # --- 1. Define the given parameters from the question ---
    # Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq1 / T_eq2

    llm_answer_option = 'B'
    llm_answer_value = 33.4

    # --- 2. Verify the physical reasoning ---
    # The LLM's reasoning is as follows:
    # a) For a planet in thermal equilibrium, the equilibrium temperature T_eq is related to its
    #    orbital distance 'a' and albedo 'A' by: T_eq ∝ ((1 - A) / a^2)^(1/4).
    #    Since the albedo 'A' is the same for all planets, it cancels out in ratios.
    #    Therefore, T_eq ∝ (1 / a^2)^(1/4) = 1 / a^(1/2).
    #    This implies that the orbital distance 'a' is proportional to 1 / T_eq^2.
    #    So, a3 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^2. This reasoning is correct.

    # b) Kepler's Third Law for planets orbiting the same star states that P^2 ∝ a^3,
    #    where 'P' is the orbital period.
    #    This means P ∝ a^(3/2).
    #    So, P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2). This reasoning is also correct.
    #    The planet masses are negligible compared to the star's mass and do not affect this relationship.

    # c) Combining the two relationships:
    #    P3 / P1 = [ (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^2 ]^(3/2) = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3.
    #    This final derived formula is correct. The LLM correctly identified that the mass ratios
    #    and the specific albedo value are extraneous information.

    # --- 3. Perform the calculation based on the verified reasoning ---
    # First, calculate the overall temperature ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3
    try:
        T_ratio_1_3 = T_ratio_1_2 * T_ratio_2_3
    except Exception as e:

    # Now, calculate the final period ratio P3 / P1
    try:
        P_ratio_3_1 = T_ratio_1_3 ** 3
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error during final calculation of period ratio: {e}"

    # --- 4. Compare the calculated result with the LLM's answer ---
    # The LLM's step-by-step calculation:
    # T_eq1 / T_eq3 = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22
    # P3 / P1 = (3.22)^3 ≈ 33.386
