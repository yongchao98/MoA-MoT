    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. This is the ratio P3 / P1.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n    *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n    *   Ratio of masses: M_p1 / M_p2 = 1.15 (Planet1 to Planet2)\n    *   Ratio of masses: M_p2 / M_p3 = 1.35 (Planet2 to Planet3)\n    *   Albedo (A) is the same for all three planets (A = 0.3).\n    *   The planets are in circular orbits around the same star.\n\n3.  **List Careful Points and Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the luminosity of its star (L_star), its distance from the star (the semi-major axis, 'a', for a circular orbit), and its albedo (A). The formula is derived by balancing the energy absorbed from the star with the energy radiated by the planet.\n        *   Energy Absorbed ∝ L_star * (1 - A) / a²\n        *   Energy Radiated ∝ T_eq⁴\n        *   Setting them equal gives: T_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / a²\n        *   Therefore, T_eq ∝ (1 - A)¹/⁴ / a¹/²\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the law simplifies to:\n        *   P² ∝ a³\n    *   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the mass ratios of the planets and the specific value of the albedo. We need to determine if this information is necessary.\n        *   The mass of a planet is typically negligible compared to the mass of its star, so it doesn't significantly affect the orbital period in Kepler's Third Law. The mention of the TTV (Transit Timing Variation) method is context; this method *uses* planet masses to find them, but the mass values are not needed for this specific calculation.\n        *   Since the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets, the (1 - A)¹/⁴ term will be a constant factor for all of them and will cancel out when we take ratios. Therefore, the specific value of 0.3 is not needed.\n\n4.  **Derive the Relationship between Period and Temperature:**\n    *   **Step 4a: Relate orbital distance (a) to temperature (T_eq).**\n        *   From the equilibrium temperature relation, since L_star and A are constant for all three planets, we have: T_eq ∝ 1 / a¹/².\n        *   Squaring both sides gives: T_eq² ∝ 1 / a.\n        *   This means the orbital distance is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature: a ∝ 1 / T_eq².\n        *   Therefore, the ratio of the orbital distances of Planet3 and Planet1 is: a3 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)².\n\n    *   **Step 4b: Relate orbital period (P) to orbital distance (a).**\n        *   From Kepler's Third Law, P² ∝ a³.\n        *   Taking the square root gives: P ∝ a³/².\n        *   Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods is: P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)³/².\n\n    *   **Step 4c: Combine the relationships.**\n        *   Substitute the expression for the distance ratio (a3 / a1) from Step 4a into the equation for the period ratio (P3 / P1) from Step 4b.\n        *   P3 / P1 = [ (T_eq1 / T_eq3)² ]³/²\n        *   The exponents multiply: P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)⁽² * ³/²⁾ = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Values:**\n    *   **Step 5a: Find the temperature ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3.**\n        *   We are given T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4 and T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3.\n        *   We can find the overall ratio by multiplying the individual ratios:\n        *   T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22.\n\n    *   **Step 5b: Calculate the final period ratio P3 / P1.**\n        *   Using the formula derived in Step 4c: P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³.\n        *   P3 / P1 = (3.22)³\n        *   P3 / P1 = 3.22 * 3.22 * 3.22 ≈ 33.386\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated factor is approximately 33.4.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        *   A) ~ 4.4\n        *   B) ~ 33.4\n        *   C) ~ 3.2\n        *   D) ~ 10.4\n    *   The result matches option B.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n<<<B>>>",
