    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the starting material.**\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By convention, this is placed at position 1 on the ring.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group is attached to carbon 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group is attached to carbon 5.\n\nTo find the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), we can count the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the structure.\n*   **Rings**: There is one ring (the cyclohexene ring). This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n*   **Pi (π) bonds**:\n    1.  One C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring. This contributes +1.\n    2.  One C=C double bond in the vinyl group. This contributes +1.\n    3.  One C=O double bond in the formyl group. This contributes +1.\n    4.  One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group. This contributes +1.\n\nSo, the total IHD of the starting material is:\nIHD_start = (1 ring) + (4 π bonds) = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction.**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI**.\nThis reagent combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts.\n*   **Alkene (C=C) reduction**: The C=C double bonds in the ring and the vinyl group will be reduced to C-C single bonds.\n*   **Aldehyde (-CHO) reduction**: The formyl group will be completely reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH) reduction**: The carboxylic acid group will be completely reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\nThe reaction will transform the starting material as follows:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n\nThe final product is a trisubstituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated monocyclic alkane.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\nWe analyze the structure of the final product to find its IHD.\n*   **Rings**: The cyclohexane ring is still present. This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n*   **Pi (π) bonds**: All the double bonds (both C=C and C=O) from the starting material have been reduced to single bonds. Therefore, there are no π bonds in the product. This contributes +0 to the IHD.\n\nSo, the total IHD of the product is:\nIHD_product = (1 ring) + (0 π bonds) = 1.\n\n**Alternative Method (Change in IHD):**\nWe can also calculate the final IHD by considering the change from the initial IHD.\n*   Initial IHD = 5.\n*   Each π bond that is reduced to a single bond decreases the IHD by 1.\n*   Reduction of the C=C bond in the ring: ΔIHD = -1.\n*   Reduction of the C=C bond in the vinyl group: ΔIHD = -1.\n*   Reduction of the C=O bond in the formyl group: ΔIHD = -1.\n*   Reduction of the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group: ΔIHD = -1.\n*   The ring structure is not broken, so its contribution to IHD remains.\n*   Total change in IHD = -1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = -4.\n*   Final IHD = Initial IHD + Total Change = 5 - 4 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The product is a saturated molecule containing a single ring, so its index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.\n\nFinal Answer is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>",
