    # --- Define the premises from the question ---
    # 1. The protein is a transcription factor that must dimerize to function.
    protein_requires_dimerization = True

    # --- Define biological principles based on the premises ---
    # A dominant-negative mutation in a heterozygote (WT/Y) means:
    # - The phenotype is mutant (not wild-type), and it's a loss-of-function.
    # - The mutant protein (Y) interferes with the wild-type protein (WT).
    # For a dimeric protein, this interference typically happens when a mutant subunit
    # binds to a wild-type subunit, forming a non-functional heterodimer (WT-Y).
    # This "poisons" the wild-type subunit, causing a "loss-of-function of the wild-type allele".

    # C) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele

        # Check part 1: "loss-of-function of the wild-type allele"

        # Cellular quality control mechanisms (like the proteasome) often recognize
        # and degrade malformed or non-functional protein complexes.
        # A non-functional WT-Y dimer is a prime target for such degradation.

            # Why not A? "protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype"
            # While the phenotype is loss-of-function, "aggregation" is a less specific
            # mechanism than the formation of a non-functional heterodimer. Option C's
            # "loss-of-function of the wild-type allele" is more precise.
            
            # Why not B? "change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype"
            # A dominant-negative mutation is a type of loss-of-function, not gain-of-function.
            
            # Why not D? "loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype"
            # Two errors:
            # 1. A dominant mutation causes a mutant phenotype, not wild-type.
            # 2. If the Y protein completely lost its ability to dimerize, it could not
            #    bind to and interfere with the WT protein. This would likely be a
            #    recessive mutation, not dominant-negative.
