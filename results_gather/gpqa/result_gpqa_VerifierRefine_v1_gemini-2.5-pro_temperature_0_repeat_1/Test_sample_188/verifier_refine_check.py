def check_particle_sbs_association():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the question about particles
    and spontaneously-broken symmetry (SBS).

    The core principle is Goldstone's Theorem: SBS of a continuous global
    symmetry results in massless (or nearly massless) excitations called
    Goldstone bosons. These are the particles most directly "associated"
    with SBS. The question asks which particle is NOT associated in this way.
