    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. We have a ketone that can form an enolate (the Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor), and a strong base (t-BuOK) to facilitate the reaction.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Enolate Formation (Michael Donor)**\n    *   The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base. It will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let's identify the α-carbons relative to the carbonyl group (C1). The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **α-carbon C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   **α-carbon C6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has one α-proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Deprotonation must occur at C6. The steric hindrance of the t-BuOK base is irrelevant for regioselectivity here, as there is only one possible site for deprotonation. The enolate will form with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The enolate formed is the nucleophile. The α-carbon of the enolate (C6) attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   The new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Protonation**\n    *   The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated during the workup step to give the final neutral product, A.\n\n5.  **Structure and Naming of Product A**\n    *   The resulting structure has an ethyl propanoate chain attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   The options provide names based on the propanoate as the parent chain: `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`. This means we must name the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment as C1.\n        *   The point of attachment is the original C6 of the ketone. So, C1 of the substituent is the old C6. This carbon has a **methyl** group.\n        *   Moving around the ring, the original C1 (the carbonyl carbon) is now C2 of the substituent. This position has an **oxo** group.\n        *   The original C2 (with the ethyl and methyl groups) is now C3 of the substituent. This position has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The nitroalkane has acidic α-protons and acts as the Michael donor, while the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor. KOH is the base.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Carbanion Formation (Michael Donor)**\n    *   The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The α-carbon is the one bonded to the nitro group (-NO₂).\n    *   The resulting carbanion is resonance-stabilized by the adjacent nitro group, making it a good nucleophile. The nucleophile is `[CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile (the CH carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n\n4.  **Step 3: Protonation**\n    *   The resulting nitrile-stabilized carbanion is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product, B.\n\n5.  **Structure and Naming of Product B**\n    *   The structure formed is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1.\n        `CN(1) - CH₂(2) - CH(CH₃)(3) - CH(NO₂)(4) - CH₂(5) - CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (A is incorrect)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (A and B are incorrect)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (A and B are correct)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (B is incorrect)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
