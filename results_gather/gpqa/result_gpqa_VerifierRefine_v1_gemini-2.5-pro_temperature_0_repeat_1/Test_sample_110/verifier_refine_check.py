    # --- Verification for Reaction A ---
    # Reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate -> A
    # Expected Name A (from option C): ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate

    # Step 1: Analyze the ketone reactant to find the deprotonation site.
    # The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.
    # Alpha-carbons are C2 and C6.
    # C2 is quaternary (bonded to ethyl and methyl) and has no alpha-protons.
    # C6 is tertiary (bonded to methyl and hydrogen) and has one alpha-proton.
    # Therefore, deprotonation and subsequent attack must occur at C6.
    attack_site_on_ketone = 'C6'

    # Step 2: Apply IUPAC rules for naming the resulting product as a substituent.
    # The product is named as a propanoate, so the cyclohexanone part is a substituent.
    # The attachment point (original C6) is numbered as C1 of the substituent ring.
    # Numbering proceeds around the ring: original C1 (carbonyl) becomes C2, original C2 becomes C3, etc.
    
    # Step 3: Map the groups from the original ketone to the new substituent numbering.
    # - Original C6 had a methyl group -> Substituent has a methyl at C1.
    # - Original C1 was a carbonyl -> Substituent has an oxo group at C2.
    # - Original C2 had an ethyl and a methyl group -> Substituent has an ethyl and a methyl at C3.

    # Reaction: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile -> B
    # Expected Name B (from option C): 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile

    # The alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-) attacks the beta-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN).
    # Product Structure: CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN

    # Step 2: Apply IUPAC naming rules to this structure.
    # The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.
    # The longest carbon chain including C1 is 6 carbons long.
    # Chain: CN(1)-CH2(2)-CH(CH3)(3)-CH(NO2)(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)

    # Step 3: Identify substituents and their positions.

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    # Both names in option C are consistent with the products derived from the reaction mechanisms
    # and IUPAC nomenclature rules. The other options contain incorrect names (e.g., wrong substituent positions
    # for A, or wrong carbon chain length for B).
