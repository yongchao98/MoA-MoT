    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. This peak often overlaps with the C-H stretching peaks which also appear in this region (around 2850-3000 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The typical range is 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The presence of both a broad O-H peak and a strong C=O peak strongly indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This tells us there are no protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four candidate molecules are saturated alkanoic acids, so they are all consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This is a very complex splitting pattern. For a proton to exhibit this multiplicity, it must be coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, n+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton (a C-H) that has one single proton, a -CH₂- group, and a -CH₃ group as its neighbors on adjacent carbons.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** For a proton to exhibit this multiplicity, it must be coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n    *   **Another Triplet (t):** Coupled to another, different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton (a C-H) that has one single proton, one -CH₂- group, and a second, different -CH₂- group as its neighbors on adjacent carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the protons on the main carbon chain for each molecule to see if they can produce these specific splitting patterns.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:**\n    *   `CH₃-CH(b)-CH(d)-CH₂(e)-COOH` (with CH₃ groups on C(b) and C(d))\n    *   Proton H(d) is coupled to H(b) (1H), H(e) (2H), and a methyl group (3H). This could give a **dtq**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton and two different sets of two protons. So, it cannot produce a **dtt**.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:**\n    *   `CH₃CH₂-CH(d)-CH(f)-COOH` (with CH₃ groups on C(d) and C(f))\n    *   Proton H(d) is coupled to the -CH₂- of the ethyl group (2H), H(f) (1H), and a methyl group (3H). This could give a **dtq**.\n    *   Again, there is no proton in this molecule that could produce a **dtt**.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:**\n    *   `CH₃CH₂-CH(e)-CH(f)-COOH` (with C₂H₅ groups on C(e) and C(f))\n    *   Proton H(e) is coupled to the -CH₂- of the main chain ethyl group (2H), H(f) (1H), and the -CH₂- of the side chain ethyl group (2H). This could give a **dtt**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and a 3H group. So, it cannot produce a **dtq**.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:**\n    Let's draw this structure and label the key protons:\n    ```\n          CH₂(c)H₃(d)   CH₂(g)H₃(h)\n          |              |\n    CH₃(a)-CH(b)----CH(e)----CH₂(f)----COOH\n    ```\n    *   **Analyze proton H(b):**\n        *   It is on a carbon adjacent to C(a), which has a -CH₃ group (3 protons). This coupling will produce a **quartet**.\n        *   It is on a carbon adjacent to C(e), which has a single proton, H(e). This coupling will produce a **doublet**.\n        *   It is on a carbon adjacent to C(c), which has a -CH₂- group (2 protons). This coupling will produce a **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for H(b) will be split into a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal described.\n\n    *   **Analyze proton H(e):**\n        *   It is on a carbon adjacent to C(b), which has a single proton, H(b). This coupling will produce a **doublet**.\n        *   It is on a carbon adjacent to C(f), which has a -CH₂- group (2 protons). This coupling will produce a **triplet**.\n        *   It is on a carbon adjacent to C(g), which has another -CH₂- group (2 protons). This coupling will produce a second **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for H(e) will be split into a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal described.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nMolecule D is the only candidate that has protons matching both of the complex splitting patterns observed in the 1H NMR spectrum. The proton at position (b) gives the dtq signal, and the proton at position (e) gives the dtt signal.\n\n<<<D>>>",
