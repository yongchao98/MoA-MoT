    # Step 2: Define the fundamental relationships from the problem statement.
    
    # The number of stars N(d) up to a distance d is N(d) = rho * V(d) = rho * (4/3)*pi*d**3.
    # The number of stars dN in a thin shell of radius d and thickness dd is dN = rho * dV.
    # The volume of the shell is dV = 4*pi*d**2 * dd.
    # So, dN = rho * 4*pi*d**2 * dd.
    # This gives us the derivative of N with respect to d:
    dN_dd = rho * 4 * pi * d**2

    # The relationship between distance and parallax is d = 1/plx.

    # Step 3: Use the chain rule to find dN/d(plx).
    # The chain rule states: dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx))

    # First, find dd/d(plx) by differentiating d = 1/plx with respect to plx.

    # Step 4: Analyze the result.

    # Let's see if the expression is of the form C / plx^4.
    expected_expression = constants / plx**4

    # Step 5: Verify the correctness.
    # If our derived expression simplifies to the expected expression, the logic is correct.
    # We can check if their difference simplifies to zero.
