    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the fundamental assumption.**\nThe problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere in space. The number density `ρ` is the number of stars per unit volume.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the number of stars to distance.**\nLet's consider the number of stars, `dN`, located in a thin spherical shell around the observer. Let the inner radius of this shell be `d` and its thickness be `dd`.\n*   The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n*   The volume of the thin shell, `dV`, can be found by differentiating the volume with respect to the radius: `dV = (dV/dd) * dd = 4πd² * dd`.\n*   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this volume `dV` is the density multiplied by the volume:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n**Step 3: Introduce the concept of parallax.**\nParallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The standard astronomical formula is:\n`plx = 1/d`\n(where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\nFrom this, we can express the distance `d` in terms of parallax:\n`d = 1/plx`\n\n**Step 4: Relate the differential elements `dd` and `d(plx)`.**\nThe question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. To find this, we need to express `dd` in our equation for `dN` in terms of `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n*   `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n*   Rearranging this gives: `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\nThe negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are considering the number of stars within a small positive range of parallax `d(plx)`, this corresponds to a small range of distance `dd`. Since the number of stars must be a positive quantity, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n`|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n**Step 5: Combine the expressions to find the final relationship.**\nNow we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` from Steps 3 and 4 into the equation for `dN` from Step 2.\n*   Start with: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n*   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n*   Substitute `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` (using the magnitude): `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n*   Simplify the expression: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n**Step 6: Determine the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\nThe quantity we are looking for is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the final equation from Step 5.\n*   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\nSince `ρ` is a constant, the term `4πρ` is also a constant. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Uniform Density:** The result is entirely dependent on the initial assumption of a uniform spatial density of stars.\n2.  **Euclidean Space:** The formula for the volume of a spherical shell `dV = 4πd²dd` assumes a flat, 3D Euclidean space, which is an excellent approximation for these calculations.\n3.  **Meaning of the Result:** The `1/plx⁴` relationship means that there are far more stars with small parallax (which are far away) than stars with large parallax (which are close by). Specifically, if you halve the parallax, the number of stars you find in a small, fixed-width parallax bin at that new value increases by a factor of `2⁴ = 16`.\n\nBased on the analysis, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>",
