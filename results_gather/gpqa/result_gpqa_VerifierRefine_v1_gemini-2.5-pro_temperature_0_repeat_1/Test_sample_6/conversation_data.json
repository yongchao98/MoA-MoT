    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The problem describes the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{-}e^{+}$). The reaction is:\n    $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+}$\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Energy Conservation and Lorentz Invariance:** For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products. The rest mass of an electron is $m_e$, and the rest mass of a positron is also $m_e$. Therefore, the minimum energy required in the CM frame is:\n    $E_{CM, threshold} = m_e c^2 + m_{e^+} c^2 = 2m_e c^2$\n\n3.  **Use the Invariant Mass:** The square of the center-of-mass energy ($E_{CM}^2$) is a Lorentz invariant quantity, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames. This quantity is called the Mandelstam variable $s$. We can calculate $s$ in the laboratory frame (the frame of the universe).\n    Let the four-momentum of the high-energy gamma-ray be $p_{\\gamma} = (E_{\\gamma}, \\vec{p}_{\\gamma})$ and the four-momentum of the CMB photon be $p_{CMB} = (\\epsilon, \\vec{p}_{\\epsilon})$.\n    The invariant mass squared is $s = (p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2$.\n    $s = (E_{\\gamma} + \\epsilon)^2 - c^2(\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} + \\vec{p}_{\\epsilon})^2$\n    For photons, energy and momentum are related by $E = pc$. So, $|\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}| = E_{\\gamma}/c$ and $|\\vec{p}_{\\epsilon}| = \\epsilon/c$.\n    $s = (E_{\\gamma} + \\epsilon)^2 - (E_{\\gamma}^2 + \\epsilon^2 + 2E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two photons' paths.\n    Expanding and simplifying:\n    $s = E_{\\gamma}^2 + 2E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon + \\epsilon^2 - E_{\\gamma}^2 - \\epsilon^2 - 2E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon \\cos\\theta$\n    $s = 2E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\n4.  **Determine the Threshold Condition:** The reaction is possible if $s \\ge (2m_e c^2)^2$.\n    So, $2E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon (1 - \\cos\\theta) \\ge (2m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n5.  **Find the Minimum Gamma-Ray Energy:** The question asks for the energy threshold above which the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited. This corresponds to the minimum energy $E_{\\gamma}$ for which the reaction can occur. To find this minimum energy, we must consider the most favorable condition for the reaction, which is the one that maximizes the CM energy for a given $E_{\\gamma}$. This occurs when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized.\n    The maximum value of $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is 2, which happens when $\\cos\\theta = -1$. This corresponds to a head-on collision ($\\theta = 180^{\\circ}$ or $\\pi$ radians).\n    Substituting this into our threshold condition:\n    $2E_{\\gamma, th}\\epsilon (1 - (-1)) = (2m_e c^2)^2$\n    $4E_{\\gamma, th}\\epsilon = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon}$\n\n6.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $\\epsilon = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Threshold Energy:**\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n8.  **Convert the Result to GeV:**\n    Since $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. This matches option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Lorentz Invariance:** Using the invariant mass $s$ is the most straightforward way to solve problems involving relativistic collisions, as it is the same in all inertial frames.\n*   **Threshold Condition:** The core of the problem is setting the center-of-mass energy equal to the rest mass of the particles being created.\n*   **Collision Angle:** The minimum threshold energy for the high-energy particle occurs in a head-on collision. This is because a head-on collision maximizes the energy available in the center-of-mass frame.\n*   **Units:** It is crucial to be consistent with units (eV, MeV, GeV) throughout the calculation. Converting all energy values to a base unit like eV before performing the main calculation helps avoid errors.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} = 2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n<<<D>>>",
