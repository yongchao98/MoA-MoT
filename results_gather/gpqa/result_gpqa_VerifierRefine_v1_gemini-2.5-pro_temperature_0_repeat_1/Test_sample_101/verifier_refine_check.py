    # The problem describes a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP.
    # After Cre-mediated excision, one lox site remains.
    # The standard length of a loxP or lox2272 site is 34 base pairs.
    residual_lox_site_length_bp = 34

    # For a fusion protein to be translated correctly, the two parts must be in the
    # same reading frame. This means any linker DNA between them must have a length
    # that is a multiple of 3 (the length of a codon).
    codon_length_bp = 3

    # --- Analysis ---

    # 1. Check the core claim of Answer B: Does a frameshift occur?
    # A frameshift occurs if the length of the inserted DNA (the residual lox site)
    # is NOT a multiple of the codon length.
    frameshift_occurs = (residual_lox_site_length_bp % codon_length_bp) != 0

    # 2. Does this frameshift explain the observation?
    # If a frameshift occurs, the ribosome will read the eGFP sequence in the wrong
    # frame, producing a non-functional "garbage" peptide instead of a fluorescent
    # eGFP protein. This would result in "no green signal".
    frameshift_explains_observation = frameshift_occurs

    # 3. Evaluate the other options based on the problem description.
    # Option A: Paracrine relationship. This is a functional description, not a
    # molecular synthesis mechanism. It would not prevent the protein from being made.
    # Option C: Missing enhancer. The CBA promoter is a strong promoter/enhancer. If it
    # failed, the whole bicistronic mRNA would be affected, likely causing the red
    # signal (mCherry) to be absent as well. The problem is specific to the green signal.
    # Option D: Stuck in Golgi. This implies the protein is synthesized but mis-trafficked.
    # A synthesized eGFP fusion protein would still be fluorescent, leading to a
    # mislocalized green signal, not a complete absence of signal.

    # --- Final Verdict ---
    if llm_answer == "B":
        if frameshift_explains_observation:
            # The logic is sound. The 34 bp lox site causes a frameshift,
            # which prevents functional eGFP synthesis, matching the observation.
            return "Correct"
        else:
            # This case would only be reached if lox sites had a length divisible by 3.
            return f"Incorrect. The length of a lox site ({residual_lox_site_length_bp} bp) is divisible by {codon_length_bp}, so no frameshift would occur. The reasoning for answer B is flawed."
    else:
        return f"Incorrect. The provided answer is {llm_answer}, but the most likely reason for the lack of a green signal is a frameshift mutation, which corresponds to answer B. The 34 bp residual lox2272 site is not divisible by 3, which shifts the reading frame of eGFP, preventing its correct translation."
