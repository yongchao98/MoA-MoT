  "question": "You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify which mutation is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to render the protein non-functional. The most effective mutations for creating a non-functional protein are those that cause a major disruption to its structure, such as:\n*   **Nonsense mutation:** Introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated (shortened) and usually non-functional protein.\n*   **Frameshift mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This alters the reading frame, changing every subsequent amino acid and often leading to a premature stop codon.\n\nLess effective, but still possible, are:\n*   **Missense mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not affect protein function, depending on the importance of that amino acid.\n*   **In-frame deletion/insertion:** Deletes or inserts one or more complete codons (multiples of three nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. Its effect depends on the importance of the altered region.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nFirst, let's establish the reading frame and the initial amino acid sequence of the functional protein. The sequence starts with `ATG`, which is the start codon. We read the sequence in groups of three (codons).\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...TGA-3’`\n*   **Translation (using a codon table):**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - Start\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n    *   ...and so on.\n*   **Intact Protein Sequence:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant Sequence**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Comparison with Intact: The codons `TTT CTC` have been changed to `TTC TAC`.\n    *   Translation:\n        *   `ATG` -> Met (same)\n        *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). Since `TTT` also codes for Phe, this part is a silent mutation.\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). The original codon was `CTC` (Leucine).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. The amino acid Leucine is replaced by Tyrosine. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Comparison with Intact: The codons `TTT CTC` have been changed to `TTC TAA`.\n    *   Translation:\n        *   `ATG` -> Met (same)\n        *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe) (silent mutation)\n        *   `TAA` -> **STOP**. `TAA` is a stop codon.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The synthesis of the protein will stop after only two amino acids (Met-Phe). The resulting protein will be extremely short and non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Comparison with Intact: The sequence is complex. Let's assume the simplest changes. `CTC` becomes `TAC` and `ACT` becomes `GTC`.\n    *   Translation:\n        *   `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr)\n        *   `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val)\n    *   **Effect:** This represents at least two **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, this might alter the protein's function, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function compared to a nonsense mutation. Another possibility is a frameshift mutation, but the change to a stop codon in Mutant 2 is more definitive.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   Comparison with Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` vs `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`. It appears the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion**. The codon for Glycine (`GGT`) has been removed from the sequence. This results in a protein that is missing one amino acid. While this could be detrimental, it is generally less disruptive than a nonsense mutation that truncates the vast majority of the protein.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nComparing the effects of the four mutations:\n*   Mutant 1: Missense (less likely to be a complete knockout).\n*   **Mutant 2: Nonsense (premature STOP codon). This is the most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein.**\n*   Mutant 3: Multiple missense mutations (less likely to be a complete knockout than a nonsense mutation).\n*   Mutant 4: In-frame deletion (less likely to be a complete knockout than a nonsense mutation).\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene. This will lead to the production of a tiny, non-functional peptide, thus being the most probable mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>",
