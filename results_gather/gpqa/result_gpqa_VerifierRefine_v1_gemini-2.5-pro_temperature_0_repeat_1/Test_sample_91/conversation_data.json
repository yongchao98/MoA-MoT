    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 to count the atoms and bonds accurately.\n\nLet's draw the expanded structure:\n```\n      CH3       CH3           CH3\n      |         |             |\nH3C - C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C - CH3\n      |                           |\n      CH3                         CH3\n```\nNow, let's count the number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** There are 4 methyl (CH3) groups attached to the main chain, plus the 8 carbons in the main chain itself. Total C = 4 * 1 (from methyls) + 8 (in chain) = 12 atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   From the two (CH3) groups on the left: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   From the =CH- group: 1 H\n    *   From the -CH2- group: 2 H\n    *   From the -CH(CH3)- group: 1 H on the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H\n    *   From the next -CH2- group: 2 H\n    *   From the next -CH= group: 1 H\n    *   From the two (CH3) groups on the right: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   Total H = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**Step 2: Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nUsing the structure from Step 1, we count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** We can see two double bonds in the structure. So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We need to carefully count all single bonds between carbon atoms.\n    *   Bonds connecting methyl groups to the main chain: 2 (left) + 1 (middle) + 2 (right) = 5\n    *   Bonds within the main chain itself: C=C-C (1), C-C-C (1), C-C-C (1), C-C=C (1) = 4\n    *   Total C-C single bonds = 5 + 4 = **9**.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Hess's Law to Calculate Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe can calculate this using a thermodynamic cycle involving atomization of reactants and formation of the product from gaseous atoms.\n\nThe formula is:\nΔH_f = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Total bond energy of the product]\n\n**Part A: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\nThe reactants are 12 moles of C(s) and 11 moles of H2(g).\n*   Atomization of Carbon: 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n    *   Energy required = 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Atomization of Hydrogen: 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    *   Energy required = 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Part B: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product (C12H22)**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Total bond energy of product = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Part C: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n*   ΔH_f = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Total bond energy of product]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 4: Compare with Options and Check Units**\n\nOur calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 1900 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\n*   Option D is the total bond energy of the product, not the enthalpy of formation.\n*   Option C has the correct number (1900) but the wrong unit (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol).\n*   Option B is given in kJ/g. Let's convert our answer to these units to check.\n\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C12H22:\n*   Molar Mass = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\n*   ΔH_f (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.445 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches Option B.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\n1.  The molecular formula is C12H22.\n2.  The molecule contains 9 C-C bonds, 2 C=C bonds, and 22 C-H bonds.\n3.  The enthalpy of atomization of reactants (12 C + 11 H2) is 13100 kJ.\n4.  The total bond energy of the product (C12H22) is 11200 kJ/mol.\n5.  The enthalpy of formation is 13100 - 11200 = 1900 kJ/mol.\n6.  Converting to kJ/g: 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol = 11.44 kJ/g.\n7.  This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
