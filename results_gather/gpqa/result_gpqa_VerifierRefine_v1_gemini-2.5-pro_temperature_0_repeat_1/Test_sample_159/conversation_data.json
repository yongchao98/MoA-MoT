    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture's Geometry:**\n    *   The aperture is an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. The apothem is the perpendicular distance from the center to a side.\n    *   The problem states that N becomes infinitely large (N -> ∞).\n    *   As the number of sides of a regular polygon with a fixed apothem increases to infinity, the polygon approaches a circle.\n    *   The radius of this limiting circle is equal to the apothem 'a'.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Diffraction Regime:**\n    *   The problem specifies that the observation is in the \"far field region\". This indicates that we are dealing with Fraunhofer diffraction.\n    *   The incident light is a monochromatic plane wave of wavelength λ, falling normally on the aperture.\n\n3.  **Recall the Fraunhofer Diffraction Formula for a Circular Aperture:**\n    *   The intensity distribution of the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture (known as the Airy pattern) is given by:\n        `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n    *   In this formula:\n        *   `θ` is the angular distance from the central axis.\n        *   `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center (θ=0).\n        *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n        *   `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number.\n        *   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n\n4.  **Determine the Positions of the Intensity Minima:**\n    *   The intensity minima (dark rings) occur where the intensity `I(θ)` is zero. This happens when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sin(θ))` is zero, for `θ ≠ 0`.\n    *   The minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. Let `z_m` be the m-th non-zero root of `J₁(x)`.\n    *   The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n        `k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n\n5.  **Apply the Small Angle Approximation:**\n    *   The problem allows for the small angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n    *   The condition for the m-th minimum simplifies to:\n        `k * a * θ_m = z_m`\n    *   Substituting `k = 2π/λ`:\n        `(2π/λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n    *   Solving for the angular position `θ_m` of the m-th minimum:\n        `θ_m = (z_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n6.  **Find the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    *   We need the values of the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`:\n        *   First root: `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n        *   Second root: `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum (`m=1`) is:\n        `θ₁ = (z₁ * λ) / (2π * a) = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum (`m=2`) is:\n        `θ₂ = (z₂ * λ) / (2π * a) = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This is the difference between the angular position of the second minimum and the first minimum: `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    *   `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n    *   `Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) * λ / (2π * a)`\n    *   Substituting the values of the roots:\n        `Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)`\n        `Δθ = (3.1839) * λ / (2π * a)`\n    *   Calculating the final coefficient:\n        `Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * λ / a ≈ 0.5067 * λ / a`\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated value `0.5067 * λ / a` matches option A, `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Limit of N -> ∞:** The key insight is realizing the N-sided polygon becomes a circle of radius 'a'.\n*   **Apothem vs. Radius:** The given length 'a' is the apothem, which becomes the radius of the circular aperture, not the diameter.\n*   **Bessel Function Zeros:** The minima of the Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of `J₁(x)`, not other functions. You need to know (or be given) the values of these zeros.\n*   **Question Phrasing:** \"Angular distance between the first two minima\" means `θ₂ - θ₁`. It does not mean the position of the first minimum (`θ₁ ≈ 0.610 λ/a`, which is option B) or the angular width of the central maximum (`2θ₁ ≈ 1.220 λ/a`, which is related to option C).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that the angular distance between the first and second minima is `Δθ ≈ 0.506 * λ / a`.\n\n<<<A>>>",
