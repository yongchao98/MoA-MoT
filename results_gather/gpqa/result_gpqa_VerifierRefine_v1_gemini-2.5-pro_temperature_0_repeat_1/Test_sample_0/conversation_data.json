    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty in its energy. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which can be expressed as:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can approximate this as ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. This uncertainty in energy, ΔE, is also known as the \"natural linewidth\" of the energy level.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Lifetime of the first state (τ₁): 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of the second state (τ₂): 10⁻⁸ s\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State:**\n    *   **For the first state (E₁):**\n        The lifetime is Δt₁ = τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n        The energy uncertainty is ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For the second state (E₂):**\n        The lifetime is Δt₂ = τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n        The energy uncertainty is ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n4.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\n    *   To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their combined energy uncertainties. A common criterion (like the Rayleigh criterion for optical resolution) is that the separation must be at least as large as the sum of the individual linewidths (or at least the larger of the two).\n    *   The total uncertainty can be considered the sum of the individual uncertainties: ΔE_total = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂.\n    *   ΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   ΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   ΔE_total ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    Therefore, to resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    We need to find the option that satisfies the condition: |E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** Is 10⁻⁴ eV > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV? Yes, 10⁻⁴ is much larger.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** Is 10⁻⁸ eV > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No, it is smaller.\n    *   **C) 10⁻⁹ eV:** Is 10⁻⁹ eV > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No, it is much smaller.\n    *   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** Is 10⁻¹¹ eV > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No, it is much smaller.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Shorter Lifetime, Larger Uncertainty:** The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has a much larger energy uncertainty (linewidth) than the state with the longer lifetime. This shorter-lived state is the primary factor limiting the resolution.\n*   **Order of Magnitude:** The required energy separation is on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV. Any proposed energy difference smaller than this will mean the energy levels overlap too much to be distinguished.\n*   **Constants:** Using the value of ħ in units of eV·s simplifies the calculation significantly, avoiding the need to convert from Joules to electron-volts at the end.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the only energy difference that is large enough to ensure the two quantum states can be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV, as it is the only option greater than the calculated minimum required separation of ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n<<<A>>>",
