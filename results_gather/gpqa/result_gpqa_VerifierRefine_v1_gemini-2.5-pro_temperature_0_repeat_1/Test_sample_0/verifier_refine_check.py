    Checks the correctness of the answer to the quantum resolution problem.

    The function verifies the answer based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
    To clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater
    than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths).

    The uncertainty principle gives ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.
