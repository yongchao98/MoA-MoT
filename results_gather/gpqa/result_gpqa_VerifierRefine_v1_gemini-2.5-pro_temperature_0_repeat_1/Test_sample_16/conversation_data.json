    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System and Given Information**\n*   We are given a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The chemical formula for this complex is [CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule.\n*   The initial concentration of the complex is [CaY]²⁻_initial = 0.02 M.\n*   The formation constant (stability constant) for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n*   The problem states the pH is \"ideal\". This is a crucial piece of information. EDTA's ability to bind metal ions is pH-dependent. \"Ideal pH\" implies that the pH is high enough (typically pH > 10) so that virtually all free EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, Y⁴⁻. This allows us to use the given formation constant K_f directly without needing to calculate a conditional formation constant (K'_f).\n\n**2. Write the Relevant Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe formation of the complex is described by the reaction:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant for this reaction is:\nK_f = [ [CaY]²⁻ ] / ( [Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻] ) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nSince we start with the complex, it will dissociate to a small extent to establish equilibrium. The relevant reaction to consider is the dissociation of the complex:\n[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**3. Determine the Equilibrium Constant for Dissociation**\nThe dissociation constant, K_d, is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction. It is the inverse of the formation constant, K_f.\nK_d = 1 / K_f\nK_d = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 0.2 x 10⁻¹⁰ = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**4. Set Up an ICE Table**\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Reaction      | [CaY]²⁻      | Ca²⁺ | Y⁴⁻  |\n|---------------|--------------|------|------|\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M       | 0 M  | 0 M  |\n| **Change (C)**  | -x           | +x   | +x   |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| (0.02 - x) M | x M  | x M  |\n\n**5. Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x**\nNow, we use the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d, with the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table.\nK_d = ( [Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻] ) / [ [CaY]²⁻ ]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n**6. Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\nBecause the formation constant K_f is very large, the dissociation constant K_d is very small (2 x 10⁻¹¹). This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n**7. Solve for x**\nRearrange the equation to solve for x²:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (2 x 10⁻²)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nNow, take the square root to find x:\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nTo make the square root easier, we can write 4 x 10⁻¹³ as 40 x 10⁻¹⁴:\nx = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\nx = √40 * √(10⁻¹⁴)\nx ≈ 6.32 * 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**8. Final Conclusion**\nFrom the ICE table, 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.\n[Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\nThis value matches one of the options provided.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   **Dissociation vs. Formation:** The problem starts with the product (the complex), so the calculation must be based on the dissociation reaction.\n*   **K_d vs. K_f:** Remember to use the dissociation constant (K_d = 1/K_f) for the dissociation reaction.\n*   **\"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This simplifies the problem significantly by allowing the direct use of K_f and assuming [Y⁴⁻] is the only form of free EDTA.\n*   **Validity of Approximation:** The calculated value of x (6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M) is much smaller than the initial concentration (0.02 M), confirming that the approximation (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) was valid.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** The 1:1 dissociation means that at equilibrium, [Ca²⁺] = [Y⁴⁻] = x.\n\nThe final calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<D>>>",
