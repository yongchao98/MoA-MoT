    # --- Step 1: Define the equilibrium and the equilibrium constant ---
    # The problem starts with the complex, so we consider its dissociation:
    # [CaY]2- <=> Ca2+ + Y4-
    # The equilibrium constant for dissociation (Kd) is the inverse of the formation constant (Kf).
    K_d = 1 / K_f

    # --- Step 2: Set up the equilibrium expression ---
    # From the ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):
    # Initial: [CaY]2- = 0.02, [Ca2+] = 0, [Y4-] = 0
    # Change:  [CaY]2- = -x,   [Ca2+] = +x, [Y4-] = +x
    # Equil:   [CaY]2- = 0.02-x, [Ca2+] = x,  [Y4-] = x
    #
    # The expression is: Kd = ([Ca2+] * [Y4-]) / [[CaY]2-]
    # K_d = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)

    # --- Step 3: Solve for x, the concentration of Ca2+ ---
    # Because K_f is very large, K_d is very small (2e-11). This means the
    # dissociation is minimal, and x will be very small compared to 0.02.
    # We can use the standard simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.
    # This is the same assumption made in the provided explanation.
    #
    # K_d ≈ x^2 / 0.02
    # x^2 ≈ K_d * 0.02

    # --- Step 4: Check the correctness of the answer ---
    # We compare our calculated value with the provided answer.
    # A relative tolerance is used to account for potential rounding in the answer options.

    # --- Step 5: Verify the simplifying assumption ---
