    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the relativistic harmonic oscillator problem.

    1.  Numerical Verification: It compares the result from the formula in option A with a numerical solution derived directly from the conservation of energy principle for a highly relativistic case.
    2.  Classical Limit Check: It verifies that the formula from option A correctly reduces to the well-known classical formula in the non-relativistic limit (v << c).
