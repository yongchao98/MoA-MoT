    # The percentage of a specific complex is determined by its distribution coefficient (alpha).
    # For the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2], we need to calculate alpha_2.
    # The formula for alpha_n is: α_n = (β_n * [L]^n) / (1 + Σ(β_i * [L]^i))
    # where [L] is the free ligand concentration.

    # A key step is to determine the free ligand concentration [SCN-].
    # Since the ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the metal ion 
    # concentration (0.01 M), it is a standard and valid approximation to assume that the 
    # free ligand concentration is equal to the total initial concentration.
