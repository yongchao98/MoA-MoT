    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify All Cobalt-Containing Species:**\n    In the solution, cobalt(II) exists in equilibrium with several thiocyanato complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    *   Free Co²⁺ ion: `[Co²⁺]`\n    *   Monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   Dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   Trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n    The mass balance equation for cobalt is:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n2.  **Use the Overall Stability Constants (β):**\n    The overall stability constants (β_n) describe the formation of each complex from the free metal ion and the ligand:\n    *   `β₁ = [Co(SCN)⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n    *   `β₃ = [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n\n    We can rearrange these to express the concentration of each complex in terms of `[Co²⁺]` and `[SCN⁻]`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Distribution Coefficient (α₂):**\n    The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`. This is the fraction of this species relative to the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. This fraction is known as the distribution coefficient, `α₂`.\n    `Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = α₂ * 100%`\n    where `α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\n4.  **Derive the Expression for α₂:**\n    First, substitute the expressions from the stability constants into the total cobalt concentration equation:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factor out the `[Co²⁺]` term:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n    Now, substitute this and the expression for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (`= β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`) into the formula for `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** We need the *free* (equilibrium) concentration of the ligand, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem gives a total cobalt concentration of `c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M` and a thiocyanate concentration of `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. Since the ligand concentration is 10 times larger than the metal ion concentration, the amount of ligand consumed in complex formation is relatively small. We can therefore make the reasonable approximation that the free ligand concentration is equal to the given total concentration: `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n    *   Let's calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator. Let `L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1`.\n        *   **Numerator:** `β₂ * L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n        *   **Denominator:**\n            *   Term 0 (for Co²⁺): `1`\n            *   Term 1 (for Co(SCN)⁺): `β₁ * L¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n            *   Term 2 (for Co(SCN)₂): `β₂ * L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n            *   Term 3 (for Co(SCN)₃⁻): `β₃ * L³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n            *   Term 4 (for Co(SCN)₄²⁻): `β₄ * L⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    *   Sum the terms in the denominator:\n        `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    *   Calculate `α₂`:\n        `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n6.  **Convert to Percentage:**\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
