    This function verifies that the key factor for parallelizing the solution
    of du/dt = Au using a fractional approximation is the partial fraction
    decomposition of that approximation.

    It does this by:
    1. Setting up a sample problem (discretized 1D heat equation matrix A).
    2. Choosing a rational approximation R(z) for exp(z).
    3. Calculating the solution u(t+tau) in two ways:
        a) "Sequential": Directly as inv(Q(tau*A)) @ P(tau*A) @ u.
        b) "Parallel": By decomposing R(z) into partial fractions and solving
           the resulting independent linear systems.
    4. Comparing the results to show the methods are equivalent.
    5. Concluding that the partial fraction decomposition (Answer B) is the
       enabling mechanism.
