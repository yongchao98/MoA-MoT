    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a **3D isotropic harmonic oscillator**. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, depending only on the radial distance $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Hamiltonian and Energy Eigenvalues:** The Hamiltonian for this system is given by:\n    $H = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(r) = \\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$\n    This Hamiltonian can be separated into three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators, one for each Cartesian coordinate:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    where $H_i = \\frac{p_i^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 i^2$ for $i = x, y, z$.\n\n3.  **Recall the Energy Levels of a 1D Harmonic Oscillator:** The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Levels of the 3D Isotropic Harmonic Oscillator:** Since the total Hamiltonian is a sum of three independent 1D Hamiltonians, the total energy is the sum of the energies of each 1D oscillator:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels can then be written as:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n5.  **Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State:** We need to find the energy for the third excited state. Let's list the first few energy levels:\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest possible energy state, which corresponds to the smallest value of $N$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z$ must be non-negative integers, the minimum value for $N$ is $0$ (when $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$).\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next lowest energy, which is for $N=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n6.  **Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:** The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $N=3$.\n    Let's list the possible combinations for $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). This gives 3 states.\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0: (2,1,0). We can permute these numbers in $3! = 6$ ways: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). This gives 6 states.\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1,1,1). This gives 1 state.\n    The total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, there is a general formula for the degeneracy $g_N$ of the N-th energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n    $g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $N=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The potential is for a harmonic oscillator, not a particle in a box. Therefore, energy expressions like $\\frac{C \\hbar^2}{2mr^2}$ (which are characteristic of an infinite spherical well) are incorrect. This immediately rules out options A and C.\n*   The question asks for the **third excited state**, not the $N=3$ state. It is crucial to correctly map the excited state number to the principal quantum number $N$. The ground state is $N=0$, the first excited state is $N=1$, and so on. Thus, the third excited state corresponds to $N=3$.\n*   The degeneracy calculation requires finding all unique combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $N$. Using the formula is a quick and reliable method.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n*   **Energy of the third excited state ($N=3$):** $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Degeneracy of the third excited state ($N=3$):** $g_3 = 10$.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10 - Incorrect energy\nB) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10 - Correct energy and degeneracy\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3 - Incorrect energy and degeneracy\nD) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3 - Correct energy, incorrect degeneracy\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
