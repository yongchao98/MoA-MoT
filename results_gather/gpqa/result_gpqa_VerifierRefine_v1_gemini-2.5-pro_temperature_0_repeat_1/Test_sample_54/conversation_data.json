    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons.**\nFirst, let's sum the integration values from the 1H NMR data:\n1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons in each of the possible compounds:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** 3 (from CH₃) + 1 (from =CH) + 1 (from =CH) + 3 (from CH₃COO) = 8 protons.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** 3 (from CH₃) + 2 (from CH₂) + 1 (from =CH) + 1 (from =CH) + 3 (from CH₃COO) = 10 protons.\n\nSince the spectrum shows a total of 8 protons, the unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options A (Trans-butenyl acetate) and D (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each signal in the 1H NMR spectrum.**\nWe are now deciding between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The structure is CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃.\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This is a typical chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group in an ester (an acetate group).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons, which is consistent with the CH₃-C(=O)-O- structure.\n    *   **Assignment:** This is the acetate methyl group.\n\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents another methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (1+1=2 peaks). This corresponds to the =CH-CH₃ part of the molecule.\n    *   **Assignment:** This is the methyl group on the propenyl chain.\n\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region, meaning the proton is directly attached to a C=C double bond.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The 'd' (doublet) means it's coupled to one proton. The 'q' (quartet) means it's coupled to three protons (a CH₃ group). This perfectly describes the proton in the =CH-CH₃ fragment, which is coupled to the other vinylic proton and the terminal methyl group.\n    *   **Assignment:** This is the proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region. The significantly downfield shift (further to the left) is caused by the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom from the acetate group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one other proton, which is the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Assignment:** This is the proton on the carbon attached to the oxygen atom (-O-CH=CH-).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry using the coupling constant (J).**\nThe final piece of information is the coupling constant, J, for the signal at 7.0 ppm, which is given as **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value represents the coupling between the two vinylic protons (-CH=CH-).\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The magnitude of the coupling constant between two protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their relative geometry.\n    *   **Trans coupling (J_trans):** Protons are on opposite sides of the double bond. The typical J-value is in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis coupling (J_cis):** Protons are on the same side of the double bond. The typical J-value is in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, which falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of the proton count, chemical shifts, and splitting patterns confirms the structure is propenyl acetate. The coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the vinylic protons proves that they are in a trans relationship. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>",
