    "An analysis of the question and the provided options is as follows:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is often due to the presence of a chiral center or other elements of chirality like an axis or a plane of chirality.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. There are bulky substituents at all four ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). Specifically, methyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups are at positions 2 and 2', and nitro (-NO2) groups are at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   **Careful Points:** Biphenyls with bulky substituents at the ortho positions can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**. This occurs because the steric hindrance from the bulky groups prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   **Restricted Rotation:** The nitro groups and methyl carboxylate groups are large enough to prevent the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar. The rotation around the central C-C bond is severely restricted.\n    *   **Chirality Condition:** For an atropisomer to be chiral, each ring must be asymmetrically substituted. In this molecule, one ring has a -COOCH3 group at C2 and a -NO2 group at C6. These are different. The other ring has a -COOCH3 group at C2' and a -NO2 group at C6'. These are also different.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Due to the restricted rotation, the rings are twisted relative to each other. In this non-planar conformation, the molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n*   **Careful Points:** The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Careful Points:** We need to check for any elements of chirality.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The central carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups). It cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. It has a C2 rotational axis passing through the C=O bond. It also has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry is always achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are *trans* to each other across the C=C double bond.\n*   **Careful Points:** This molecule exhibits geometric (cis-trans) isomerism, but the question is about optical isomerism. We need to check for chirality.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule is achiral because the plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Alternatively, the molecule has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is always achiral.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
