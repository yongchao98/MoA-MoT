    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the experimental observations.**\n\n1.  **Compound Type:** The molecule is a small, chemically synthesized peptidic compound. This is a crucial piece of information, as peptides are polymers of amino acids linked by amide bonds. Amide bonds have unique properties.\n2.  **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   An alpha-proton (the proton on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group of an amino acid) shows two distinct peaks instead of one.\n    *   These two peaks have similar chemical shifts, suggesting the proton exists in two very similar, yet distinct, chemical environments.\n    *   The integrals are roughly equal and sum to 1H. This means the two species containing this proton are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, meaning the peak splitting is not due to neighboring protons but rather to the presence of two different molecular species.\n3.  **LC-MS Data:**\n    *   LC (Liquid Chromatography) separates the crude mixture into two distinct peaks. This confirms the presence of two different chemical species that can be physically separated.\n    *   The two LC peaks have equal intensities, which corroborates the 1:1 ratio observed in the NMR spectrum.\n    *   MS (Mass Spectrometry) analysis shows that both separated peaks have the exact same mass.\n    *   This mass is consistent with the expected target molecule. This is a critical point: the two species are **isomers** (same molecular formula, same mass), not impurities with different structures like precursors or byproducts.\n    *   The analysis is done at an \"elevated temperature.\" This can sometimes be used to improve peak shape or separation for isomers that are slowly interconverting.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the possible explanations (the options A-D) against the observations.**\n\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor.**\n    *   A precursor from the synthesis would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass than the final product.\n    *   This contradicts the MS data, which shows both species have the same, expected mass.\n    *   **Conclusion: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   In a standard (achiral) environment, enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties, including their NMR spectra and chromatographic retention times.\n    *   To see two different NMR signals or two different LC peaks, you would need a chiral environment (e.g., a chiral NMR solvent or a chiral LC column). The problem implies standard analytical techniques.\n    *   Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would appear as a single species in both the NMR and LC-MS.\n    *   **Conclusion: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction.**\n    *   \"Double coupling\" means an extra amino acid was accidentally added. For example, instead of synthesizing the dipeptide Ala-Gly, you might get some Ala-Ala-Gly.\n    *   This byproduct would have a different molecular formula and a significantly higher mass than the target peptide.\n    *   This contradicts the MS data, which shows both species have the same, expected mass.\n    *   **Conclusion: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n    *   Crucially, diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   They give distinct NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons in two diastereomers will have different chemical shifts.\n    *   They can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography techniques like HPLC (LC).\n    *   By definition, they are isomers, so they have the same molecular formula and the same mass.\n    *   This explanation is consistent with *all* the observations: two NMR signals, two separable LC peaks, and the same mass for both species.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific type of diastereomerism in a peptide.**\n\nA very common source of diastereomerism in peptides is **cis-trans isomerism** about the amide (peptide) bond. Due to resonance, the C-N amide bond has significant double-bond character, restricting rotation. This creates two planar isomers: *cis* and *trans*. While the *trans* form is heavily favored for most amino acids, the energy difference is much smaller for peptide bonds preceding a proline residue. Therefore, peptides containing proline often exist as a slowly interconverting mixture of *cis* and *trans* isomers, which are diastereomers of each other (assuming other chiral centers exist in the peptide, which is a given). This phenomenon perfectly explains the observation of two species in a ~1:1 ratio that are separable but have the same mass.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The presence of a mixture of diastereoisomers is the only option that accounts for all the experimental data.\n\n<<<D>>>",
