    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the energy of the nucleus.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus (X)**\n    *   The problem states that nucleus X is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n    *   The atomic number (Z) of Lithium is 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n    *   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleus in question is Lithium-6, denoted as $^6$Li.\n\n2.  **Determine the Rest Energy ($E_0$) of the Nucleus**\n    *   The rest energy of a nucleus is equivalent to its rest mass ($m_0$) via the equation $E_0 = m_0c^2$.\n    *   A common method for estimating the rest mass of a nucleus in such problems is to sum the rest masses of its constituent nucleons (protons and neutrons), ignoring the binding energy. This is an approximation, as the actual mass is slightly less due to the mass defect corresponding to the binding energy. Let's proceed with this approximation, as it often matches the intended solution method for textbook problems.\n    *   Rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) ≈ 938.272 MeV/c²\n    *   Rest mass of a neutron ($m_n$) ≈ 939.565 MeV/c²\n    *   The rest mass of the $^6$Li nucleus is the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons:\n        $m_0 = 3 \\times m_p + 3 \\times m_n$\n        $m_0 = 3 \\times (938.272 \\text{ MeV/c²}) + 3 \\times (939.565 \\text{ MeV/c²})$\n        $m_0 = 2814.816 \\text{ MeV/c²} + 2818.695 \\text{ MeV/c²}$\n        $m_0 = 5633.511 \\text{ MeV/c²}$\n    *   The rest energy ($E_0$) is therefore 5633.511 MeV, which is equal to 5.6335 GeV.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n    *   The total relativistic energy (E) is given by the formula $E = \\gamma E_0$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor, γ, is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The problem states that the speed of the nucleus is v = 0.96c.\n    *   First, calculate $v^2/c^2$:\n        $(v/c)^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216$\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}}$\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.5714$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\n    *   Now, we can calculate the total energy using the rest energy and the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $E = \\gamma \\times E_0$\n    *   $E = (\\frac{1}{0.28}) \\times 5.6335 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5.6335 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $E \\approx 20.1197 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    *   The calculated energy is approximately 20.120 GeV.\n    *   Let's look at the given options:\n        A) 18.475 GeV\n        B) 23.069 GeV\n        C) 20.132 GeV\n        D) 21.419 GeV\n    *   Our calculated value of 20.120 GeV is extremely close to option C, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (about 0.06%) is likely due to slightly different constants used for the proton and neutron masses in the problem's original formulation.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Identification of the Nucleus:** It is crucial to correctly identify the number of protons and neutrons to determine the nucleus is $^6$Li.\n*   **Rest Mass Calculation:** The key step is realizing that the intended method is likely the summation of the masses of the constituent nucleons, rather than using the more precise, experimentally measured mass of the nucleus (which includes the effect of binding energy). Using the precise mass would yield a result of ~20.005 GeV, which is not as close to any option.\n*   **Total Energy vs. Kinetic Energy:** The question asks for \"the energy,\" which in relativistic contexts typically refers to the total energy ($E = \\gamma m_0c^2$), not just the kinetic energy ($KE = (\\gamma - 1)m_0c^2$). The magnitude of the options confirms this interpretation.\n*   **Precision:** The calculation of the Lorentz factor from v=0.96c is exact ($\\gamma = 1/0.28$). The precision of the final answer depends on the precision of the constants used for the rest masses.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the calculated total energy is approximately 20.120 GeV, which corresponds most closely to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
