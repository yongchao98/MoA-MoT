    This function programmatically verifies the stereochemical analysis of the
    self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  The reaction is a self-metathesis of a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.
    2.  The product is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.
    3.  We need to consider all possible pairings of the starting enantiomers: (R)+(R), (S)+(S), and (R)+(S).
    4.  For each pairing, we consider the possible geometries (E/Z) of the new double bond.
    5.  We then count the number of unique stereoisomers, accounting for enantiomers and meso compounds.
