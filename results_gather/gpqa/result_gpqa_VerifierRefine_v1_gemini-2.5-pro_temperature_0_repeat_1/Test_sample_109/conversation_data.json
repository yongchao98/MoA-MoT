    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Observability Criteria**\n\nFirst, we need to establish the conditions a star must meet to be observable by both instruments. This involves two main factors: the star's brightness (apparent magnitude) and its position in the sky (declination).\n\n1.  **Magnitude Limit:**\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17 (i.e., `m_V < 17`).\n    *   HIRES can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 16 (i.e., `m_V < 16`).\n    *   To be detected by **both**, a star must satisfy the stricter of the two limits. Therefore, the required condition is **`m_V < 16`**.\n\n2.  **Location (Declination) Limit:**\n    *   The Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO) is in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately 24° S. It can observe the entire southern celestial hemisphere and the northern celestial hemisphere up to a declination of about +65°.\n    *   The W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES) is in the Northern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately 20° N. It can observe the entire northern celestial hemisphere and the southern celestial hemisphere down to a declination of about -70°.\n    *   For a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination (DEC) must lie in the overlapping range. Therefore, the required condition is **`-70° < DEC < +65°`**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Each Star**\n\nNow, we will evaluate each star against these two criteria. We will use the distance modulus equation to find the apparent magnitude (m_V) when it's not directly provided:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10pc) + A_V`\nwhere `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc), and `A_V` is the extinction in the V band. Extinction is calculated as `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n---\n\n**Star1**\n*   **Given:** DEC = -75°, M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc.\n*   **Declination Check:** The declination is -75°. This is outside the required range (`-70° < DEC < +65°`) as it is too far south to be seen from Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star1 cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star2**\n*   **Given:** DEC = 55°, m_V = 16.5 mag.\n*   **Declination Check:** The declination is +55°. This is within the required range (`-70° < +55° < +65°`).\n*   **Magnitude Check:** The apparent magnitude is m_V = 16.5 mag. This is not brighter than 16 (`16.5` is not `< 16`). It is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star2 cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star3**\n*   **Given:** DEC = 48°, m_V = 15.5 mag.\n*   **Declination Check:** The declination is +48°. This is within the required range (`-70° < +48° < +65°`).\n*   **Magnitude Check:** The apparent magnitude is m_V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than 16 (`15.5 < 16`). It is bright enough for both instruments.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Star3 can be observed by both.**\n\n---\n\n**Star4**\n*   **Given:** DEC = -48°, M_V = 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag, d = 10 pc.\n*   **Declination Check:** The declination is -48°. This is within the required range (`-70° < -48° < +65°`).\n*   **Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Extinction: `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag.\n    *   Apparent Magnitude: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(10/10) + A_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(1) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** The apparent magnitude is m_V = 16.74 mag. This is not brighter than 16 (`16.74` is not `< 16`). It is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star4 cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star5**\n*   **Given:** DEC = 60°, M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc.\n*   **Declination Check:** The declination is +60°. This is within the required range (`-70° < +60° < +65°`).\n*   **Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Extinction: `A_V = 0` (not mentioned).\n    *   Apparent Magnitude: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(5/10) + A_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(0.5) + 0 = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995` mag.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** The apparent magnitude is m_V ≈ 15.0 mag. This is brighter than 16 (`15.0 < 16`). It is bright enough for both instruments.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Star5 can be observed by both.**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis, the stars that can be detected with both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs are **Star3** and **Star5**.\n\n<<<A>>>",
