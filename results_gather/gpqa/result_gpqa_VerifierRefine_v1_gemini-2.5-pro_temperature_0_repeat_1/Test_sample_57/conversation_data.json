    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the concept of \"Regularization at High Energies\"**\n\nIn physics, particularly in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), when we try to calculate physical quantities like the probability of particle interactions, our calculations often result in infinite values. These infinities typically arise from integrals over all possible energies and momenta of virtual particles that mediate the interactions. The \"high energies\" part of the integral (also known as the ultraviolet or UV region) is a common source of these divergences.\n\n*   **Regularization:** This is a mathematical trick or procedure used to manage these infinities. It involves temporarily modifying the theory by introducing a new parameter, called a \"regulator,\" which makes the divergent integrals finite. For example, one might impose an artificial maximum energy limit (a \"cutoff\") on the integrals.\n*   **Renormalization:** After regularization, the theory is still dependent on this artificial regulator. The next step, renormalization, is a systematic procedure to absorb the regulator-dependent parts into the fundamental constants of the theory (like mass and charge), redefining them as the physically measurable, finite quantities.\n\nA theory that requires this process is called \"renormalizable.\" A theory that is inherently free from these high-energy (UV) divergences does not need regularization in the first place. The question asks to identify such a theory from the given options.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each option**\n\n*   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):**\n    *   **What it is:** QCD is the quantum field theory that describes the strong nuclear force, which binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons.\n    *   **Does it need regularization?** Yes. Like most QFTs, calculations in QCD involving interaction loops (e.g., gluon self-interactions) produce UV divergences. QCD is a \"renormalizable\" theory, which explicitly means that it requires the procedures of regularization and renormalization to yield finite, physical predictions.\n\n*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:**\n    *   **What it is:** This is the classical theory of electricity and magnetism, described by Maxwell's equations. It deals with macroscopic electric and magnetic fields and charges.\n    *   **Does it need regularization?** In a way, yes. The theory runs into a problem when considering a point-like charge, such as an electron. The energy stored in the electric field of a point charge (its \"self-energy\") is infinite. This is a classical analogue of a high-energy/short-distance divergence. To solve this, one must either assume the charge is not a point but has a finite size (a form of cutoff regularization) or use more advanced theories. So, it does have a high-energy problem that requires some form of regularization or modification.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):**\n    *   **What it is:** QED is the quantum field theory of the electromagnetic force. It describes how light (photons) and matter (e.g., electrons) interact.\n    *   **Does it need regularization?** Yes, absolutely. QED was the first successful renormalizable QFT. Calculations of quantities like the electron's self-energy and the \"Lamb shift\" lead to UV divergences that must be handled by regularization and renormalization. The incredible success of QED lies in how well this procedure works to produce predictions that match experiments to astonishing precision.\n\n*   **D) Superstring Theory:**\n    *   **What it is:** Superstring theory is a theoretical framework that aims to be a unified theory of all fundamental forces, including gravity. Its core idea is that fundamental entities are not point-like particles but tiny, vibrating one-dimensional \"strings.\"\n    *   **Does it need regularization?** No. This is one of the most celebrated features of the theory. In QFT, divergences arise because interactions are assumed to happen at a single spacetime point. In string theory, because the fundamental objects (strings) are extended, their interactions are \"smeared out\" in spacetime. This smearing naturally smooths out the interactions at very short distances (high energies). As a result, the calculations of scattering amplitudes in superstring theory turn out to be finite without the need for an external regularization procedure. The theory is believed to be \"UV-finite.\"\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   QCD and QED are textbook examples of theories that *require* regularization.\n*   Classical Electrodynamics has a classical divergence problem that also requires a form of regularization.\n*   Superstring Theory is specifically formulated in a way that is believed to avoid high-energy divergences altogether, thus not requiring regularization.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
