    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product.\n\n**Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Bromination of Cyclohexanone**\n    *   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is an alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction substitutes a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, the two α-positions are equivalent. The reaction yields **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Reaction of 2-bromocyclohexanone with Sodium Hydroxide**\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone).\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, a strong base) and heat.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction occurs with α-halo ketones that have at least one acidic proton on the other α-carbon.\n    *   **Mechanism Summary:** The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α-carbon that does not have the bromine (C6). The resulting carbanion (enolate) attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate (a derivative of bicyclo[4.1.0]heptanone). The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained three-membered ring. The overall result is a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone is converted into a five-membered ring of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Product 2:** The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of an Acid Chloride**\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid).\n    *   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Product 3:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom, forming **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Reduction of the Acid Chloride**\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride).\n    *   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a reduction of an acid chloride. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent. Unlike stronger reducing agents like LiAlH₄ (which would reduce the acid chloride to a primary alcohol), LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is selective and stops the reduction at the aldehyde stage.\n    *   **Product 4:** The product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Task:** We need to find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule. This is equivalent to determining the number of unique signals that would appear in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **Symmetry Consideration:** Although the cyclopentane ring is not planar and exists in rapidly interconverting envelope and twist conformations, on the NMR timescale at room temperature, we can consider a time-averaged structure. This averaged structure possesses a plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane) that passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon of the ring (the one attached to the aldehyde), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen atom of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring to which the aldehyde is attached (C1) is also in a unique environment. (1 type)\n    3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The C2 and C5 carbons are adjacent to C1. Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 is equivalent to C5. Each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms. These two hydrogens on a single carbon (e.g., C2) are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a stereocenter (C1). This means they are not equivalent to each other. However, the \"upper\" hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the \"upper\" hydrogen on C5, and the \"lower\" hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the \"lower\" hydrogen on C5. This gives two distinct types of hydrogens for these four protons. (2 types)\n    4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** The C3 and C4 carbons are further from C1. Due to the plane of symmetry, C3 is equivalent to C4. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. The \"upper\" hydrogen on C3 is equivalent to the \"upper\" hydrogen on C4, and the \"lower\" hydrogen on C3 is equivalent to the \"lower\" hydrogen on C4. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens for these four protons. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing up the different types: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 H's) + 2 (from C3/C4 H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>",

This is equivalent to finding the number of unique proton signals in an ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   Let's number the ring carbons starting from the point of attachment of the aldehyde group as C1.\n    *   The C1 carbon is bonded to four different groups: 1) a hydrogen atom, 2) the aldehyde group (-CHO), 3) the C2 carbon of the ring, and 4) the C5 carbon of the ring. Therefore, C1 is a **chiral center**.\n    *   The presence of this chiral center removes any plane of symmetry that might be assumed for the ring.\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom on the chiral carbon C1 is also unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **C2 Hydrogens:** C2 has two hydrogens. Because C2 is adjacent to a chiral center (C1), these two hydrogens are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct from each other. (2 types)\n    4.  **C5 Hydrogens:** Similarly, the two hydrogens on C5 are diastereotopic. Furthermore, because C2 and C5 are in different positions relative to the chiral center, the hydrogens on C5 are distinct from those on C2. (2 types)\n    5.  **C3 Hydrogens:** The two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic. They are distinct from all other hydrogens in the molecule. (2 types)\n    6.  **C4 Hydrogens:** The two hydrogens on C4 are diastereotopic. They are also distinct from all other hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing up all the unique hydrogen environments:\n    1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2-H's) + 2 (C3-H's) + 2 (C4-H's) + 2 (C5-H's) = **10** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
