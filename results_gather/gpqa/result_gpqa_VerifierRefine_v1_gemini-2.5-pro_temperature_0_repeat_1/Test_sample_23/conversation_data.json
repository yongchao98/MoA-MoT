    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, containing only Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%, which is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   Let the molecular formula of Z be C_n H_m. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as: (m × Atomic Mass of H) / (n × Atomic Mass of C + m × Atomic Mass of H).\n*   Using atomic masses C ≈ 12 and H ≈ 1, we get: m / (12n + m) = 1/7.\n*   Cross-multiplying gives: 7m = 12n + m, which simplifies to 6m = 12n, or m = 2n.\n*   So, the molecular formula of Z is of the form C_n H_{2n}.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also mentions that Z is widely used as a solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits the C_n H_{2n} formula with n=6. We will proceed with the assumption that Z is cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture X, when heated with platinum, undergoes disproportionation to form an equimolar mixture Y.\n*   A disproportionation reaction in this context involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms between molecules. Some molecules are hydrogenated (reduced) and others are dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that its components are either saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   The problem explicitly states that Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Since Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton (since it hydrogenates to cyclohexane) and must not decolorize bromine water. The only compound that fits this description is benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene is aromatic and does not react with bromine water under these conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the components of mixture X.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   The overall reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   Since both A and B are hydrogenated to give only Z (cyclohexane), they must both be compounds with a six-carbon ring skeleton. Let their formulas be C₆Hₓ and C₆Hᵧ.\n*   From the balanced reaction C₆Hₓ + C₆Hᵧ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆, we can conserve the number of hydrogen atoms: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, which means both A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   A crucial piece of information is that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n*   We need to find two different non-conjugated cyclic alkenes with a C₆ ring, C₆Hₓ and C₆Hᵧ, such that the total number of hydrogen atoms (x + y) is 18.\n*   Let's consider possible C₆ cyclic alkenes:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀):** It has one double bond, so it is not conjugated. This is a possible candidate for A or B. (x = 10)\n    *   **Cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈):** There are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n        *   1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds, so it is excluded by the problem statement.\n        *   **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** has its double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. This is a possible candidate. (y = 8)\n*   Let's check if the pair A = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) fits all the conditions.\n    *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is x + y = 10 + 8 = 18. This is correct.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction would be: C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene). This is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. Cyclohexene is reduced, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized.\n    *   Both compounds are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Neither compound has conjugated double bonds.\n    *   Both have a C₆ ring and will hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   This pair satisfies all conditions of the problem.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Mixture X consists of one molecule of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₀) + (H atoms in C₆H₈) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a corrected step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the general formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, let its formula be C_n H_m.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This value is characteristic of the ratio 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is m / (12n + m).\n*   Setting this equal to 1/7: m / (12n + m) = 1/7.\n*   Cross-multiplying gives 7m = 12n + m, which simplifies to 6m = 12n, or m = 2n.\n*   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH₂ and the molecular formula is C_n H_{2n}.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific cycloalkane Z and the components of mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture X is treated with platinum when heated to form mixture Y via disproportionation. This is a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated.\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One is Z (the cycloalkane, C_n H_{2n}). The other component does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   The most plausible dehydrogenation product that is stable and does not react with bromine water is an aromatic compound. For a single-ring system, this requires a six-membered ring to form the stable aromatic compound benzene.\n*   This strongly implies that n=6.\n*   Therefore, Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The other component of Y must be the corresponding dehydrogenation product, which is benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   Let's check if this pair fits the conditions for mixture Y:\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Both are liquids at standard conditions.\n    *   Neither decolorizes bromine water (benzene only reacts under specific conditions, not simple mixing).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene) under severe conditions gives only one substance, cyclohexane (Z), as required.\n*   Thus, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the components of mixture X.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   The overall disproportionation reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   Since both A and B are hydrogenated to give only Z (cyclohexane), they must both be compounds with a six-carbon ring skeleton. Let their formulas be C₆Hₓ and C₆Hᵧ.\n*   From the balanced reaction, we can conserve the number of hydrogen atoms: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, which means both A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   A crucial constraint is that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n*   We need to find two different non-conjugated cyclic alkenes with a C₆ ring, C₆Hₓ and C₆Hᵧ, such that x + y = 18.\n*   Let's consider the possible non-conjugated C₆ cyclic alkenes:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀):** It has one double bond, so it is not conjugated. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈):** It has two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   (Note: 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds and is therefore excluded).\n*   The pair A = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) fits all conditions.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is x + y = 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent with the disproportionation products.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Mixture X consists of one molecule of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₀) + (H atoms in C₆H₈) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
