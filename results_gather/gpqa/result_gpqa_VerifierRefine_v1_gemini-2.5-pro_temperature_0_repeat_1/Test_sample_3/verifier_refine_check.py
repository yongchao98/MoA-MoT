def check_correctness_of_maxwell_answer():
    """
    Checks if the provided answer about Maxwell's equations and magnetic monopoles is correct.

    The core physics principle is that the existence of magnetic monopoles (magnetic charges)
    and their movement (magnetic currents) would introduce new source terms into two of
    Maxwell's equations, making them symmetric with their electric counterparts.

    1.  Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0): This equation states there are no magnetic
        monopoles. If they exist, this law must change to include a magnetic charge
        density term (∇ ⋅ B ≠ 0). This relates to the 'divergence of the magnetic field'.

    2.  Faraday's Law of Induction (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t): For symmetry, a moving magnetic
        charge (a magnetic current, J_m) must create a circulating electric field, just as
        an electric current creates a circulating magnetic field. This adds a magnetic
        current term to Faraday's law. This relates to the 'circulation of the electric field'.

    The other two equations, Gauss's Law for electricity and the Ampere-Maxwell Law,
    are unaffected as they describe phenomena caused by electric charges and currents.
