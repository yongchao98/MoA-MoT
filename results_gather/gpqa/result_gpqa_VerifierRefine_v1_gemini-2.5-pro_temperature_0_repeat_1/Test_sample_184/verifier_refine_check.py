def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the given answer for the eigenvalues of the 
    Hamiltonian H = epsilon * (sigma . n).

    The function performs the following steps:
    1.  Sets an arbitrary value for the energy constant `epsilon`.
    2.  Defines the Pauli matrices sigma_x, sigma_y, and sigma_z.
    3.  Runs a loop to test multiple random unit vectors `n`.
    4.  For each `n`, it constructs the Hamiltonian matrix H.
    5.  It then numerically calculates the eigenvalues of H using numpy.linalg.eigvals.
    6.  It compares these calculated eigenvalues with the expected eigenvalues from the
        proposed answer A, which are [+epsilon, -epsilon].
    7.  If the calculated values match the expected values for all tested random vectors,
        the function concludes the answer is correct. Otherwise, it reports a failure.
