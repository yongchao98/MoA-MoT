    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction. We are given its ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR spectra. The molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X, is C₁₁H₁₂O. Since the reaction involves a base (DABCO) and heat, it is likely a rearrangement or elimination, meaning the product will have the same molecular formula, C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\nLet's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C₁₁H₁₂O:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\nA benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. This leaves 2 degrees of unsaturation, which could be two double bonds (C=C, C=O) or a triple bond.\n\n**Analysis of ¹³C-NMR Data:**\n*   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), most likely a ketone or an aldehyde.\n*   **δ 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s):** These six signals are in the aromatic/alkene region (δ 100-150 ppm). The presence of signals corresponding to 2 carbons each (126.9 and 129.1) suggests symmetry, which is typical for a para-disubstituted benzene ring. A benzene ring has 6 carbons. A C=C double bond has 2 carbons. This accounts for more than 6 carbons in this region, so we have both a benzene ring and a C=C double bond.\n*   **δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s):** These are two aliphatic carbon signals, likely from methyl groups (CH₃).\n\n**Analysis of ¹H-NMR Data:**\n*   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d):** These are two signals in the vinyl region. The fact that they are both doublets indicates they are coupled to each other, forming a -CH=CH- group.\n*   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons, corresponding to two methyl (CH₃) groups that have no adjacent protons. One is likely attached to the aromatic ring (a tolyl group), and the other is likely attached to the carbonyl group (an acetyl group) or a C=C double bond.\n\n**Assembling the Product Structure:**\n1.  We have a carbonyl group (C=O) from the ¹³C-NMR. Since there is no aldehyde proton signal (δ 9-10) in the ¹H-NMR, it must be a ketone.\n2.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. One substituent is a methyl group (let's assign it δ 2.31), making it a p-tolyl group.\n3.  We have another methyl group (δ 2.28), which is a singlet. This is consistent with a methyl ketone, -C(=O)CH₃.\n4.  We have a -CH=CH- group.\n5.  Let's combine these fragments: a p-tolyl group, a -CH=CH- group, and a methyl ketone group (-C(=O)CH₃). The most stable arrangement is a conjugated system.\n    Structure: `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃` which is (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n6.  Let's verify this structure with the data:\n    *   Formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. (p-tolyl = C₇H₇; -CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃ = C₄H₅O. Total = C₁₁H₁₂O). Correct.\n    *   DoU: Benzene ring (4) + C=C (1) + C=O (1) = 6. Correct.\n    *   ¹H-NMR: p-tolyl-CH₃ (s, 3H), -C(=O)CH₃ (s, 3H), p-disubstituted ring (2d, 2H each), -CH=CH- (2d, 1H each). This matches the data perfectly. The protons on the ring ortho to the electron-withdrawing enone group are deshielded (δ 7.71), while the others are at δ 7.08. The vinyl proton β to the carbonyl is more deshielded (δ 7.68) than the α proton (δ 6.75).\n    *   ¹³C-NMR: Ketone C=O (δ 197.7), 2 methyls (δ 21.3, 28.4), and 8 sp² carbons (4 aromatic CH, 2 aromatic C-q, 2 vinyl CH). This is consistent.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction is the conversion of Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) into (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one using a non-nucleophilic base (DABCO) and heat. This is a rearrangement reaction. We need to find which of the given options for Compound X can rearrange to this product. All options are epoxides.\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** The styryl group is C₆H₅-CH=CH-. This compound has a phenyl group, not the p-tolyl group required to form the product. Incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound also contains a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), not a p-tolyl group. Incorrect.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match C₁₁H₁₂O. Incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The 4-methylstyryl group is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`. The structure is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`.\n    *   **Formula Check:** C₁₁H₁₂O. (p-tolyl = C₇H₇; vinyl epoxide = C₄H₅O. Total = C₁₁H₁₂O). Correct.\n    *   **Reaction Plausibility:** This compound is a vinylic epoxide. The base-catalyzed rearrangement of a terminal vinylic epoxide (`R-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`) to a vinylic methyl ketone (`R-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃`) is a known and plausible transformation under these conditions (base and heat). The reaction proceeds via isomerization, converting the terminal epoxide moiety into the more thermodynamically stable methyl ketone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe product of the reaction is (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. Only option D, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, has the correct molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O) and the necessary p-tolyl group in its carbon skeleton to serve as the precursor for this product. The reaction is a base-catalyzed isomerization of a vinylic epoxide.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "**Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Reaction Product**\n\nFirst, we analyze the provided NMR spectra to identify the product. The starting material, Compound X, has the formula C₁₁H₁₂O. The reaction is a base-catalyzed rearrangement at high temperature, which is typically an isomerization. Therefore, the product is expected to have the same molecular formula, C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C₁₁H₁₂O is 6. A benzene ring accounts for 4 DoU, leaving 2 DoU, likely corresponding to a C=C and a C=O bond.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 197.7** is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   The signals in the aromatic/alkene region (δ 126-145 ppm), specifically the presence of two signals each corresponding to two carbons (**δ 126.9 (2C)** and **δ 129.1 (2C)**), strongly indicate a symmetrically para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The pair of doublets at **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)** is a classic AA'BB' pattern, confirming a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The singlet at **δ 2.31 (3H, s)** corresponds to a methyl group attached to the aromatic ring, confirming a **p-tolyl group** (`p-CH₃-C₆H₄-`).\n    *   The singlet at **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** corresponds to another methyl group with no adjacent protons. Combined with the ketone from the ¹³C NMR, this indicates a **methyl ketone** moiety (`-C(=O)CH₃`).\n    *   The pair of doublets at **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)** indicates two coupled protons on a double bond (`-CH=CH-`).\n\n*   **Assembling the Product:**\n    The fragments are a p-tolyl group, a -CH=CH- group, and a methyl ketone group. The only logical structure that connects these is (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one: `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃`. This structure is consistent with all spectral data and has the correct formula, C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of Compound X to (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. Since this rearrangement does not affect the aromatic ring, the starting material must also contain a p-tolyl group. We evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** The structure contains a phenyl group (`C₆H₅-`), not a p-tolyl group. The carbon skeleton does not match the product. Incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This also contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. The carbon skeleton does not match. Incorrect.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match the required C₁₁H₁₂O. Incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The structure is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`.\n    *   **Formula Check:** C₁₁H₁₂O. This is correct.\n    *   **Skeleton Check:** It contains a p-tolyl group, matching the product's skeleton.\n    *   **Reaction Plausibility:** This compound is a terminal vinylic epoxide. Base-catalyzed isomerization of such an epoxide to the corresponding α,β-unsaturated methyl ketone is a known and plausible transformation. The atoms of the epoxide fragment, `-CH(O)CH₂` (C₂H₃O), rearrange to form the methyl ketone fragment, `-C(=O)CH₃` (C₂H₃O). The total atom count is conserved.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe product is unambiguously (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. Only option D, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, possesses the correct molecular formula and the necessary p-tolyl carbon skeleton to form this product under the given reaction conditions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
