    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's identify the substituents and their relative positions:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. Synthesizing such a crowded substitution pattern requires careful control of directing effects, often using blocking groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at adjacent (ortho) positions.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Routes (Options A-D)**\n\nLet's evaluate the initial steps of each option, as this is crucial for setting up the correct substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Due to its bulk, the major product is the para-isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene). The desired ortho-isomer is a minor product. A \"high-yield synthesis\" would not start with a step that gives the desired intermediate in low yield. Thus, this route is inefficient.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Forms nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduces nitrobenzene to aniline.\n    *   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex that deactivates the ring and prevents the desired alkylation. This is not a viable synthetic step.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   This option contains a chemically impossible step. Step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is for diazotization of an amino group. However, the product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid derivative of nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which has no amino group. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group directs the incoming electrophile (-SO3H) to the ortho and para positions. The para position is sterically more accessible, so the major product is **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This step is a classic example of using a **blocking group**. The sulfonic acid group now occupies the para position.\n    *   iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now, we have two directing groups:\n        *   -tBu (at C1) is an o,p-director. Its para position (C4) is blocked. It directs to the ortho positions (C2, C6).\n        *   -SO3H (at C4) is a meta-director. It directs to positions C2 and C6.\n        *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the C2 (and C6) position. This allows for a high-yield synthesis of **1-tert-butyl-2-nitro-4-benzenesulfonic acid**. This intermediate has the crucial ortho relationship between the tert-butyl group and a nitro group, which mirrors the relationship between the tBu and NO2 groups in the final product.\n\n**4. Conclusion on the Best Strategy**\nThe strategy in Option B is the only one that provides a high-yield route to an ortho-disubstituted intermediate, which is essential for building the final 1,2,3-pattern. The use of sulfonation as a blocking strategy is a key technique for achieving this. While the subsequent steps (iv-ix) in Option B represent a complex series of transformations that may appear confusing or even contain a typo in their ordering, the initial three steps are fundamentally sound and superior to all other options. The remaining reagents are used to convert the initial nitro group into the final ethoxy group (via reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis to a phenol, and etherification), introduce the final nitro group, and remove the sulfonic acid blocking group (desulfonation). The overall set of reagents and the initial strategy strongly point to B as the correct pathway.\n\n**Final Step-by-Step Analysis of the Correct Path (based on reagents in Option B):**\n1.  **i) t-Butylation:** Benzene → tert-butylbenzene\n2.  **ii) Sulfonation (Blocking):** tert-butylbenzene → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid\n3.  **iii) Nitration:** → 1-tert-butyl-2-nitro-4-benzenesulfonic acid\n4.  **iv) Reduction:** → 2-amino-1-tert-butyl-4-benzenesulfonic acid\n5.  **v) Diazotization:** → Diazonium salt intermediate\n6.  The remaining steps (vi-ix) would involve a sequence of hydrolysis (to form a phenol), a second nitration, desulfonation (to remove the blocking group), and finally etherification to yield the target product. Although the exact order in option B is debatable, it contains all the necessary reagents for a plausible, if complex, synthesis.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option B outlines the only viable high-yield strategy.\n\n<<<B>>>",

Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Routes (Options A-D)**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to identify the most viable strategy for installing the groups with the correct regiochemistry in high yield. We can often find the correct answer by identifying fatal flaws in the other options.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Due to its large size, the incoming nitro group will preferentially add to the para position, which is sterically unhindered. The major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene. The desired ortho-isomer, a necessary precursor, would be a minor product. A \"high-yield synthesis\" would not rely on a low-yield step, so this route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Forms nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduces nitrobenzene to aniline.\n    *   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) is an acid, and the amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a base. They react to form a complex, which deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution. This is not a viable synthetic step.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   This option contains a chemically nonsensical step. Step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. However, the product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid derivative of nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which does not have an amino group. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group directs the incoming electrophile (-SO3H) to the ortho and para positions. The para position is sterically more accessible, so the major product is **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a classic example of using a reversible **blocking group**. The sulfonic acid group now occupies the para position.\n    *   iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now, we have two directing groups:\n        *   -tBu (at C1) is an o,p-director. Its para position (C4) is blocked by the -SO3H group. It therefore directs the incoming nitro group to the ortho positions (C2, C6).\n        *   -SO3H (at C4) is a deactivating, meta-director. It directs incoming groups to positions C2 and C6.\n        *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the C2 (and C6) position. This allows for a high-yield synthesis of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This intermediate has the crucial ortho relationship between the tert-butyl group and a nitro group, which is a key feature of the final product's substitution pattern.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe strategy outlined in Option B is the only one that provides a high-yield route to an intermediate with the required ortho-substitution pattern. The use of sulfonation as a blocking strategy is a key synthetic technique for achieving this type of regiochemical control. While the full sequence of later steps (iv-ix) is complex and may contain typos as written, the initial three steps are fundamentally sound and represent the only plausible high-yield strategy among the choices. The other options contain fatal flaws that make them non-viable. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
