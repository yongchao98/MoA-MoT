    Evaluates the correctness of the proposed synthetic routes for

    target_molecule = "2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene"
    # Relative positions in target: 1-OEt, 2-tBu, 3-NO2
    # This means (OEt, tBu) are ortho, (tBu, NO2) are ortho, (OEt, NO2) are meta.

    # --- Analysis of Option A ---
    # i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...
    # Step i: Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene. (OK)
    # Step ii: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene.
    # The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to its large steric bulk,
    # the electrophile (NO2+) will preferentially add to the para position.
    # The desired ortho-isomer is a minor product.
    # This route is not "high-yield".
    reason_A = "Incorrect. Step (ii), the nitration of tert-butylbenzene, yields 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene as the major product due to the steric hindrance of the bulky tert-butyl group. The required ortho-isomer is only a minor product, making this route inefficient and not high-yield."

    # --- Analysis of Option D ---
    # i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ...
    # Step i: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene. (OK)
    # Step ii: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline. (OK)
    # Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline.
    # The amino group (-NH2) in aniline is a strong Lewis base. It reacts with the
    # Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the
    # ring towards further electrophilic substitution. The reaction fails.
    reason_D = "Incorrect. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not viable because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the aromatic ring and preventing the alkylation."

    # --- Analysis of Option C ---
    # i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ...
    # Let's check the sequence for chemical validity.
    # Step iii produces a sulfonic acid derivative. It does not have an amino group.
    # Step iv is diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), a reaction that specifically requires a
    # primary aromatic amine (-NH2) to form a diazonium salt.
    # Applying these reagents to the product of step iii is impossible.
    reason_C = "Incorrect. Step (iv) is diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), which requires a primary amino group. The substrate from step (iii), a substituted benzenesulfonic acid, does not contain an amino group, so this reaction cannot occur."

    # --- Analysis of Option B ---
    # i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...
    # This sequence employs a classic blocking group strategy.
    # Step i: Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene. (OK)
    # Step ii: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky tBu group directs the -SO3H
    # group to the sterically accessible para position. Product: 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.
    # This is a key step to block the para position. (OK, high-yield)
    # Step iii: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.
    #   - The -tBu group (at C1) is an o,p-director. The para position (C4) is blocked. It directs to C2/C6.
    #   - The -SO3H group (at C4) is a meta-director. It directs to C2/C6.
    # Both groups direct the incoming -NO2 group to the same position (C2). This results in a
    # high yield of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. This intermediate correctly
    # establishes the required ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and a nitro group.
    # The initial strategy is sound and high-yield. The remaining reagents in the list
    # (Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, H3O+/H2O, NaOH/EtBr, dilute H2SO4) are precisely what's needed
    # to convert this intermediate to the final product, even if their order in the option is confusing.
    # The plausible path is:
    # 1. Create 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (steps i, ii, iii).
    # 2. Reduce -NO2 to -NH2 (Fe/HCl).
    # 3. Convert -NH2 to -OH via diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and hydrolysis (H3O+/Heat).
    # 4. Convert -OH to -OEt (NaOH/EtBr).
    # 5. Add the second -NO2 group (HNO3/H2SO4). All existing groups direct it to the correct position.
    # 6. Remove the -SO3H blocking group (dilute H2SO4).
    # Since this is the only option with a viable high-yield strategy, it must be the correct one.
