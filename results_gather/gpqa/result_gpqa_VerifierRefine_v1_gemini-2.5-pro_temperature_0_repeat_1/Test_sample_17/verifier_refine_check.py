    # Given values from the question
    # For Star_1
    Si_Fe_1 = 0.3  # [Si/Fe]_1
    Fe_H_1 = 0.0   # [Fe/H]_1

    # For Star_2
    Mg_Si_2 = 0.3  # [Mg/Si]_2
    Mg_H_2 = 0.0   # [Mg/H]_2

    # The definition of abundance notation [X/Y] is:
    # [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_Sun )
    # A useful identity derived from this is:
    # [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]

    # --- Step 1: Calculate [Si/H] for Star_1 ---
    # Using the identity: [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H]
    Si_H_1 = Si_Fe_1 + Fe_H_1
    # Expected Si_H_1 = 0.3 + 0.0 = 0.3

    # --- Step 2: Calculate [Si/H] for Star_2 ---
    # Using the identity: [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H]
    # Rearranging for [Si/H]: [Si/H] = [Mg/H] - [Mg/Si]
    Si_H_2 = Mg_H_2 - Mg_Si_2
    # Expected Si_H_2 = 0.0 - 0.3 = -0.3

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the final ratio ---
    # The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms, which is (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2.
    # From the definition of [Si/H]:
    # [Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si/n_H)_Sun )
    # => log10( (n_Si/n_H)_1 ) = [Si/H]_1 + log10( (n_Si/n_H)_Sun )
    # => (n_Si/n_H)_1 = 10**([Si/H]_1) * (n_Si/n_H)_Sun
    #
    # Similarly for Star_2:
    # (n_Si/n_H)_2 = 10**([Si/H]_2) * (n_Si/n_H)_Sun
    #
    # The ratio is:
    # Ratio = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2
    # Ratio = (10**Si_H_1 * (n_Si/n_H)_Sun) / (10**Si_H_2 * (n_Si/n_H)_Sun)
    # The solar abundance term cancels out.
    # Ratio = 10**Si_H_1 / 10**Si_H_2
    # Ratio = 10**(Si_H_1 - Si_H_2)
