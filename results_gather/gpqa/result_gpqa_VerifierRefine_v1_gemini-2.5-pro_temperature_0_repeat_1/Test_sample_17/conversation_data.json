    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the \"ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2\". In the context of stellar abundances, this refers to the ratio of the number fraction of silicon atoms relative to hydrogen atoms. We need to calculate the value of `(n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`.\n\n**2. Deconstruct the Abundance Notation**\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to element Y in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun. The formula is:\n`[X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_Sun )`\nwhere `n_X` and `n_Y` are the number densities (or number of atoms) of elements X and Y.\n\nA useful identity derived from this definition is:\n`[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]`\n\n**3. Analyze Star_1**\n*   We are given `[Fe/H]_1 = 0` dex and `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` dex.\n*   We want to find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio for Star_1, which is represented by `[Si/H]_1`.\n*   Using the identity `[Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H]`:\n    `[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n*   Now, we use the definition of `[Si/H]_1`:\n    `[Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_Sun ) = 0.3`\n*   Rearranging this equation to solve for the abundance ratio in Star_1:\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = 0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_Sun )`\n*   Taking the antilog (10 to the power of each side):\n    `(n_Si / n_H)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_Sun`\n\n**4. Analyze Star_2**\n*   We are given `[Mg/H]_2 = 0` dex and `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` dex.\n*   We want to find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio for Star_2, which is represented by `[Si/H]_2`.\n*   Using the identity `[Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H]`:\n    `[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`\n    `0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2`\n*   Solving for `[Si/H]_2`:\n    `[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`\n*   Now, we use the definition of `[Si/H]_2`:\n    `[Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_Sun ) = -0.3`\n*   Rearranging this equation to solve for the abundance ratio in Star_2:\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = -0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_Sun )`\n*   Taking the antilog:\n    `(n_Si / n_H)_2 = 10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_Sun`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Ratio**\n*   We need to find the ratio of the silicon abundance in Star_1 to that in Star_2:\n    `Ratio = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`\n*   Substitute the expressions we found in steps 3 and 4:\n    `Ratio = [ 10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_Sun ] / [ 10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_Sun ]`\n*   The term `(n_Si / n_H)_Sun` cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n    `Ratio = 10^0.3 / 10^-0.3`\n*   Using the rule of exponents (a^x / a^y = a^(x-y)):\n    `Ratio = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^(0.3 + 0.3) = 10^0.6`\n*   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    `10^0.6 ≈ 3.981`\n\n**6. Conclusion and Careful Points**\n*   The calculated ratio is approximately 3.98. This matches option D.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The masses of the stars (1.5 and 1.2 M_Sun) are extra information not needed for the calculation, as the final abundances are already given.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The absolute solar abundances for Fe and Mg are also not needed, because we are calculating a ratio where the solar reference abundance cancels out.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The key is to correctly interpret \"ratio of silicon atoms\" as the ratio of abundance fractions `(n_Si/n_H)`, which is the standard way to compare stellar compositions.\n\nThe final calculated value is ~3.98, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
