    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **Pyran:** A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **Tetrahydro:** The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one:** A carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2. By convention, the ring oxygen is at position 1. This structure is a cyclic ester, also known as a lactone. Specifically, it's a delta-lactone because the oxygen is attached to the 5th carbon relative to the carbonyl group.\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the carbon at position 4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center. The problem specifies that Reaction 1 produces the (R)-enantiomer and Reaction 2 produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options for the starting materials are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's analyze this structure:\n*   **Pentanoic acid:** A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   **3-ethyl:** An ethyl group is at C3. This is the chiral center of the starting material.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo:** This describes an isobutyl ester group (-C(=O)O-isobutyl) at the C5 position.\n*   **Overall Structure:** The molecule is a derivative of glutaric acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). It has a carboxylic acid at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester at the other end (C5).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the selectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Product**\n    *   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n        2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n        3.  The intermediate formed is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        4.  Upon acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid at C1 in an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) reaction to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction of the ester and lactonization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone. To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Product**\n    *   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is also a selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, but it does not reduce esters under these conditions.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n        2.  The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n        3.  The intermediate formed is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        4.  Upon acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carbonyl of the ester at C1 (which was originally C5) in an intramolecular transesterification reaction. This forms the six-membered lactone ring and eliminates isobutanol.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the transformations do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained. To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
