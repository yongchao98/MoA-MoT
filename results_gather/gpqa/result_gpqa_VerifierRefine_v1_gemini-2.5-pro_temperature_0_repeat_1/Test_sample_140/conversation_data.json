    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (d), an isotope of hydrogen, at position 2.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base, and this combination of reagents is characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Elimination Step (Benzyne Formation)**\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH2-), abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n2.  **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily/quickly than the C-D bond. However, both abstractions are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    *   The NH2- base removes the proton from C6.\n    *   The electrons from the C-H bond form a new bond between C1 and C6, creating a triple bond.\n    *   The bromide ion (Br-) leaves from C1.\n    *   This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    *   The NH2- base removes the deuteron from C2.\n    *   The electrons from the C-D bond form a new bond between C1 and C2, creating a triple bond.\n    *   The bromide ion (Br-) leaves from C1.\n    *   This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Addition Step to Each Benzyne Intermediate**\nThe amide ion (NH2-) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (C1-C6 benzyne, with D at C2):**\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH2- group adds to C1. A negative charge develops on C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 yields **3-deuterioaniline**. (The NH2 group is at C1, and the D is at C3 relative to the NH2 group).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The NH2- group adds to C6. A negative charge develops on C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 yields **2-deuterioaniline**. (The NH2 group is at C6, and the D is at C2 relative to the NH2 group).\n    *   Therefore, Pathway A produces two distinct deuterated aniline products.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate B (C1-C2 benzyne, no deuterium):**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical with respect to the addition of NH2-.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH2- group adds to either C1 or C2. The resulting carbanion is protonated by NH3. In both cases, the final product is **aniline** (C6H5NH2), which contains no deuterium.\n    *   Therefore, Pathway B produces one non-deuterated aniline product.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Total Number of Unique Organic Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified three chemically distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>",
