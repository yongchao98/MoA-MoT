    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the chemical species and their roles.**\n*   The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.\n*   In water, KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely into K⁺ (a spectator ion) and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate). H₂PO₄⁻ is a weak acid.\n*   In water, Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates completely into 2Na⁺ (spectator ions), HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H₂O. HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base of H₂PO₄⁻.\n*   Therefore, we have a buffer solution consisting of the conjugate acid-base pair H₂PO₄⁻ / HPO₄²⁻.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial moles of the buffer components.**\n*   The molar mass of KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   This gives 0.007348 mol of H₂PO₄⁻.\n*   The molar mass of the hydrated salt Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   This gives 0.005618 mol of HPO₄²⁻.\n\n**3. Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n*   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 200.00 mL or 0.20000 L.\n*   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**4. Determine the relevant equilibrium and calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺].**\n*   The buffer's pH is controlled by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, which involves the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ pair.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HPO₄²⁻(aq)\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸.\n*   The expression for Ka₂ is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   Substitute the calculated concentrations:\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (1.308)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**5. Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO₄³⁻].**\n*   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is produced in the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + PO₄³⁻(aq)\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹².\n*   The expression for Ka₃ is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   We can rearrange this to solve for the unknown, [PO₄³⁻]:\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   Now, substitute the known values. We use the initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻ and the [H⁺] calculated from the buffer equilibrium. The amount of HPO₄²⁻ that dissociates is negligible due to the very small value of Ka₃.\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (5.0562 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.2345 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection.**\n*   The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.2345 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n*   Rounding to three significant figures (consistent with the given data), we get 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n*   This matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Ensure the volume is converted from cm³ to Liters (L) for molarity calculations (1 cm³ = 1 mL = 0.001 L).\n*   **Molar Mass:** Use the molar mass of the hydrated salt (Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O), not the anhydrous form, as specified in the problem.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** It is crucial to use the correct acid dissociation constant for each step. Ka₂ governs the main buffer equilibrium that sets the [H⁺]. Ka₃ governs the subsequent dissociation that produces the target ion, PO₄³⁻.\n*   **Buffer Approximation:** The assumption that the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components ([H₂PO₄⁻] and [HPO₄²⁻]) are the same as their initial concentrations is valid here because they are part of a buffer and the Ka values are small.\n*   **Significant Figures:** The final answer should be reported with a number of significant figures consistent with the input data (1.00 g has three significant figures).\n\n<<<B>>>",
