    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the physical model.**\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)\". When a charge distribution oscillates, it can radiate electromagnetic waves. The simplest and most common model for such a system, especially when its size is much smaller than the wavelength of radiation (a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise), is an oscillating electric dipole. The oscillation along the symmetry axis (z-axis) means we can model this as an electric dipole with its moment vector `p` oscillating along the z-axis.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the formula for radiated power from an oscillating electric dipole.**\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) in the radiation zone (far-field) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n`dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\nwhere:\n*   `θ` is the angle between the direction of observation and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n*   `K` is a factor that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment (`p₀`), the angular frequency of oscillation (`ω`), and physical constants, but it is independent of the angle `θ`.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the maximum radiated power, A.**\nThe radiated power `dP/dΩ` is a function of `θ`. To find its maximum value, we need to find the maximum of `sin²(θ)`. The `sin(θ)` function has a maximum value of 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (or π/2 radians).\nTherefore, the maximum power per unit solid angle, `A`, is:\n`A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * sin²(90°) = K * (1)² = K`\nSo, the constant `K` is equal to the maximum radiated power `A`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30°.**\nWe need to find the power radiated at `θ = 30°` and express it as a fraction of the maximum power `A`.\nUsing the formula from Step 2:\n`dP/dΩ (at θ = 30°) = K * sin²(30°)`\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nSo, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\nSubstituting this into the power equation:\n`dP/dΩ (at θ = 30°) = K * (1/4)`\nSince `A = K` (from Step 3), we have:\n`dP/dΩ (at θ = 30°) = A * (1/4) = A/4`\nThe fraction of `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength λ.**\nThe function `f` mentioned in the question is the power per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`. We need to find how it depends on the wavelength `λ`.\nThe full formula for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle is:\n`dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² c) * sin²(θ)`\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by the relation `ω = 2πν = 2π(c/λ)`.\nTherefore, the `ω⁴` term has a dependence on `λ` as follows:\n`ω⁴ = (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴`\nSince all other terms in the pre-factor `K` are constants or depend on the source properties (like `p₀`), the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength is:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ 1/λ⁴` or `λ⁻⁴`.\nSo, a possible form for the function `f` includes a `λ⁻⁴` term.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results and choose the correct option.**\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 1/4, λ⁻³\nB) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\nC) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\nD) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n\nOption C matches both of our derived results.\n\n---\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Model Choice:** The problem is best modeled by an electric dipole, which is the lowest and most dominant order of radiation for an oscillating charge distribution. Higher-order multipoles (like quadrupoles) have different angular dependencies (`sin²θcos²θ`) and wavelength dependencies (`λ⁻⁶`), which would lead to option B. However, without any information suggesting the dipole moment is zero, the dipole model is the standard and correct assumption.\n*   **Angular Dependence:** The `sin²(θ)` dependence is a key characteristic of dipole radiation. Power is maximum perpendicular to the oscillation axis (`θ=90°`) and zero along the axis (`θ=0°`).\n*   **Wavelength Dependence:** The `P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ λ⁻⁴` relationship is a fundamental result for dipole radiation, also famous from Rayleigh scattering.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the standard electric dipole radiation model is that the fraction is 1/4 and the wavelength dependence is λ⁻⁴.\n\n<<<C>>>",
