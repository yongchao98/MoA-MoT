    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the information given in the question.**\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The total number of carbon atoms is 8. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Putting it together:** We have a halogen (X) and another substituent on a benzene ring. This second substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the possible chemical structures.**\n*   The halogen (X) is one substituent.\n*   The second substituent contains 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable arrangement for this is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   Let's check if this fits: Benzene ring (C6) + Acetyl group (C2) = 8 carbons in total. This matches the carbon count.\n*   The resulting structure is a halo-acetophenone.\n*   Another possibility could be a -CH2CHO group (phenylacetaldehyde derivative). This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. So, a halo-phenylacetaldehyde is also a possibility.\n*   The problem asks to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the options, which will help us determine the exact structure, including the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the provided 1H NMR options.**\nLet's look for characteristic patterns. A di-substituted benzene ring will have 4 protons in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n*   **Para (1,4) substitution:** Often gives a symmetrical pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (2H).\n*   **Ortho (1,2) and Meta (1,3) substitution:** Usually result in more complex splitting patterns with up to four distinct signals.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option shows only one proton (1H) in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which should have 4 aromatic protons). This option is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This is a classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Other Signals:** A signal at 9.9 ppm is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). A signal at 3.7 ppm (2H, s) would correspond to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **Corresponding Structure:** This data would correspond to a para-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (p-X-C6H4-CH2CHO). This structure fits the C8, di-substituted, C=O, and Ar-X criteria. However, the aromatic signals at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are very far downfield. The -CH2CHO group is not a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the aromatic protons would be expected at a higher field (closer to 7.2-7.4 ppm). This makes the chemical shifts questionable for this structure.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This again indicates a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Other Signals:** A signal at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) is characteristic of a methyl group next to a carbonyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   **Corresponding Structure:** This data corresponds to a para-halo-acetophenone (p-X-C6H4-COCH3). This structure fits all the initial criteria (C8, di-substituted, C=O, Ar-X). The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which, along with the halogen, would deshield the aromatic protons and shift them downfield to the observed 7.6-7.8 ppm range. This data is chemically consistent.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   There are no signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct spectrum for an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\nBoth options B and C describe structures that fit the basic requirements. However, the chemical shifts of the aromatic protons provide the deciding clue. The downfield shifts of 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are consistent with a benzene ring bearing two electron-withdrawing groups, one of which is strong (like the -COCH3 group in option C's structure). The shifts are too far downfield for the structure corresponding to option B (p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde). Therefore, the data in option C is the only chemically sound description for the compound.\n\nThe compound is a para-haloacetophenone, and its 1H NMR spectrum is correctly described by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
