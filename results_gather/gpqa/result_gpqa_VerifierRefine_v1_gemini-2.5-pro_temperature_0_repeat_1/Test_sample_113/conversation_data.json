    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the suitable reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactant:** butan-2-one (CH₃-CO-CH₂-CH₃) is a ketone.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃) is a cyanohydrin.\n    *   The reaction involves the addition of H and CN across the C=O double bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic addition reaction known as cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack breaks the C=O pi bond and forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   This negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product.\n\n3.  **Determine Reagent A:**\n    *   Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   This is typically achieved by adding an acid. The general representation for an acid in an aqueous solution is H₃O⁺.\n    *   The reaction is often performed by generating HCN in situ from NaCN and a mineral acid, or by adding acid in a separate workup step. In either case, an acid source is required.\n    *   Let's evaluate the options for A:\n        *   **H₃O⁺:** This represents an acid source, which is necessary for the protonation step. This is a suitable choice.\n        *   **NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction used for purification. It is not used for cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   Therefore, **A must be H₃O⁺**. This narrows down the possibilities to options B and C.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is an α-hydroxy nitrile. The key functional group undergoing transformation is the nitrile group (-C≡N).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid is an α-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The nitrile group has been converted to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The process involves the addition of two molecules of water across the C≡N triple bond.\n    *   The reaction first forms an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Determine Reagent B:**\n    *   Reagent B, in the presence of water (H₂O), must be a catalyst that can drive the hydrolysis to completion.\n    *   Let's evaluate the options for B from the remaining choices (B and C):\n        *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong mineral acid. Strong acids are standard and effective catalysts for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. While it might protonate the nitrile to some extent, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions. The reaction would be very slow or incomplete.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent for this transformation is a strong acid. **B must be HCl**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, reagent **A is H₃O⁺**.\n*   For the second reaction, reagent **B is HCl**.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
