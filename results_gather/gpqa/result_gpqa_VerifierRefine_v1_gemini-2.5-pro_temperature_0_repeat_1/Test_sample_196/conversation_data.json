    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the given IR and ¹H NMR data.**\n\n*   **Analysis of IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (the remaining signals):**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment. It is adjacent to the methyl group (making it a triplet) and also to the methine proton (see below), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). This proton is deshielded because it is benzylic (attached directly to the benzene ring). It is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (3H) and the adjacent methylene group (2H), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n        *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   The other substituent is an alkyl group. Assembling the fragments: The benzylic methine (-CH-) is attached to both a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This forms a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n        *   Therefore, the structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction.**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) and red phosphorus with hydroiodic acid (Red P / HI).\n*   **Reagent's Function:** Red P / HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically, the -COOH group is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Reaction Transformation:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The sec-butyl group at position 4 and the aromatic ring will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n    *   Product: The benzene ring will have a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\n*   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n*   Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our derived product.\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an isobutyl group, not a sec-butyl group.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is a different isomer with a different substitution pattern.\n\nThe correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>",
