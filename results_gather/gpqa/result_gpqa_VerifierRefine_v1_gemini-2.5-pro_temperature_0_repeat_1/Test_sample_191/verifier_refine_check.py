    Checks the correctness of the answer for the electric field outside a conductor with a cavity.

    The function codifies the physical principles:
    1. Charge Conservation & Induction: The charge on the outer surface is +q.
    2. Electrostatic Shielding: The field outside depends only on the outer surface charge,
       not on the internal configuration (s, r, l, theta).
    3. Shell Theorem: The field from a uniformly charged sphere is like a point charge at its center.

    # Principle 1: Charge on the outer surface
    # The conductor is initially uncharged. A charge +q inside the cavity induces -q on the
    # inner wall, so by charge conservation, a charge +q must appear on the outer surface.
    charge_on_outer_surface = q

    # Principle 2: Electrostatic Shielding
    # The conductor shields the exterior from the fields of the charges inside the cavity.
    # Therefore, the external field depends ONLY on the charge on the outer surface and is
    # independent of the cavity's parameters (r, s) and the charge's position within it.
    # This means the final expression for the field E should not contain r, s, l, or theta.
    irrelevant_vars = {r, s, l, theta}

    # Principle 3: Shell Theorem
    # Due to shielding, the +q on the outer surface distributes uniformly because the outer
    # surface is spherical and there are no other external fields.
    # The electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as that of
    # a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.
    # The distance from the center of the sphere to point P is L.
