    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial setup and charge induction.**\n*   We start with an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$.\n*   A point charge $+q$ is placed inside a spherical cavity within the conductor.\n*   According to the principles of electrostatics, this charge $+q$ will induce charges on the surfaces of the conductor.\n*   To find the induced charge on the inner surface of the cavity, we can apply Gauss's Law. Consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material, enclosing the cavity. The electric field inside the bulk of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. Therefore, the net electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero. By Gauss's Law, the total charge enclosed by this surface must also be zero. Since there is a charge of $+q$ inside the cavity, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity to make the net enclosed charge zero.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the charge on the outer surface of the conductor.**\n*   The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0).\n*   A charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface.\n*   To maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor.\n*   In electrostatic equilibrium, excess charge resides on the surfaces of a conductor. Therefore, this charge of $+q$ will be distributed on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the principle of electrostatic shielding.**\n*   A crucial property of conductors is electrostatic shielding (like a Faraday cage). The conducting material isolates the region outside the conductor from the electric fields generated by the charges inside the cavity.\n*   This means that the electric field at any point P outside the conductor is produced *only* by the charges residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n*   The configuration of charges inside the cavity (the original charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner wall) has no net effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the distribution of charge on the outer surface.**\n*   We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n*   The outer surface is a sphere of radius $R$.\n*   Since there are no other external charges or fields present, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself *uniformly* over the spherical outer surface due to symmetry. The internal configuration (the off-center cavity) does not affect the distribution on the outer surface because of the shielding effect.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the electric field at point P.**\n*   The electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is solely due to the uniform distribution of charge $+q$ on the outer spherical surface of radius $R$.\n*   A well-known result from Gauss's Law (also known as Newton's Shell Theorem for electrostatics) states that for any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n*   In this problem, the center of the outer sphere is the center of the conductor, O. The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$. The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n*   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Shielding is Key:** The conductor completely shields the outside from the details of what's inside the cavity. The only thing that matters for the outside world is the total charge that gets pushed to the outer surface.\n2.  **Symmetry of the Outer Surface:** The uniform distribution of charge on the outer surface is due to its spherical shape and the absence of any other external fields.\n3.  **Irrelevant Information:** The details about the cavity's position and size (radius $r$, distance $s$ from the center), the distance $l$ from the cavity's center to point P, and the angle $\\theta$ are all distractors. They are not needed to calculate the electric field *outside* the conductor. This information would be relevant if you were asked to calculate the field *inside* the cavity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the electric field at point P depends only on the total charge on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor ($L$). The correct expression is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
