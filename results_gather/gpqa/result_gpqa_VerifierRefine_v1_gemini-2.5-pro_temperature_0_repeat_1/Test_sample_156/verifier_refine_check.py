    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for designing a
    molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus.

    It evaluates each option based on key scientific principles:
    1.  A retrovirus has an RNA genome.
    2.  Molecular diagnostics detect genetic material (RNA/DNA).
    3.  RNA must be reverse-transcribed to cDNA for most sequencing/PCR.
    4.  PCR design requires a known genetic sequence.
    5.  Quick diagnosis in an outbreak requires detecting early, active infection.

Second, detecting IgG antibodies is not suitable for 'quick' diagnosis of an early infection due to the seroconversion window period."
