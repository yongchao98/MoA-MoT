    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the description and draw the structure.**\n\n1.  **Parent Ring:** The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n2.  **Principal Functional Group:** We have a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN). According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid is the highest priority group. This means the parent name will be **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n3.  **Placement of Major Groups:** The carboxylic acid (C1), carbaldehyde, and cyano group are all *meta* to one another. This means they are at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n4.  **Placement of Other Substituents:**\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the carboxylic acid. Para to C1 is C4. So, **-OCH3 is at C4**.\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. Ortho to C1 are C2 and C6. So, **-OH and -N(CH3)2 are at C2 and C6**.\n5.  **Resolving Ambiguities:** The final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4. Its ortho positions are C3 and C5. Therefore, the nitrile (-CN) must be at either C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (-OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n    *   **Case 1: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is occupied by methoxy, the alcohol (-OH) must be at **C2**. This leaves **C6** for the dimethylamino group and **C5** for the carbaldehyde group.\n    *   **Case 2: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by methoxy, the alcohol (-OH) must be at **C6**. This leaves **C2** for the dimethylamino group and **C3** for the carbaldehyde group.\n\n    Both cases result in valid structures that fit the description. However, IUPAC naming rules are designed to produce a single, unique name. We will see that both structures lead to the same final name. Let's proceed with the structure derived from Case 1.\n\n    **Structure (based on Case 1):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2\n\n**Step 2: Number the benzene ring according to IUPAC rules.**\n\n1.  The carbon with the principal functional group (-COOH) is C1.\n2.  We must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the substituents. We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Clockwise:** Substituents are at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise:** Substituents are at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n3.  Since both directions give the same set of locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we have a tie. The tie is broken by giving the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n4.  **List and alphabetize the substituent prefixes:**\n    *   -CN: **c**yano\n    *   -N(CH3)2: **d**imethylamino\n    *   -CHO: **f**ormyl\n    *   -OH: **h**ydroxy\n    *   -OCH3: **m**ethoxy\n5.  The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering direction that gives the cyano group the lowest possible number.\n    *   In our drawn structure, the cyano group is at the physical position we labeled '3'.\n    *   Numbering clockwise (C1 -> C2 -> C3...) gives the cyano group the locant **3**.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise (C1 -> C6 -> C5...) would give the cyano group the locant **5**.\n6.  Since 3 is lower than 5, the **clockwise** numbering is correct for this structure.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the locants for all substituents.**\n\nBased on the correct clockwise numbering of our derived structure:\n*   C1: -COOH (parent acid)\n*   C2: -OH (**2-hydroxy**)\n*   C3: -CN (**3-cyano**)\n*   C4: -OCH3 (**4-methoxy**)\n*   C5: -CHO (**5-formyl**)\n*   C6: -N(CH3)2 (**6-dimethylamino**)\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the final IUPAC name.**\n\n1.  Start with the substituent prefixes, arranged in alphabetical order, with their locants.\n    *   3-**c**yano\n    *   6-(**d**imethylamino)  *(Parentheses are used for complex substituents)*\n    *   5-**f**ormyl\n    *   2-**h**ydroxy\n    *   4-**m**ethoxy\n2.  Add the parent name at the end.\n3.  The full name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Correct locants, but prefixes are not in alphabetical order)\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Matches our derived name exactly)\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
