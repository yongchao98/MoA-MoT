    Checks the correctness of the IUPAC name for the described molecule.

    The function verifies the answer by:
    1. Parsing the proposed IUPAC name (Option C) to determine the positions of all functional groups.
    2. Checking if this structure satisfies all the descriptive constraints given in the question.
    3. Verifying that the IUPAC name itself is constructed correctly (numbering and alphabetical order).
