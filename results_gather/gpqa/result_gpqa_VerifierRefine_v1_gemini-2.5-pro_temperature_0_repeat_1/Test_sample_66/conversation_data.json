    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State of the System:**\n    The system consists of two electrons, and we are considering their orbital angular momentum. The system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state, which is given as:\n    $|\\Psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    This notation means:\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (since it's in a p orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a p orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$). The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and the Desired Outcome:**\n    A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    We want to find the probability of getting the following specific outcomes simultaneously:\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron being in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron being in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Represent the Final State:**\n    The state corresponding to the desired measurement outcome is an uncoupled state, represented as $|l_1, l_2, m_1, m_2\\rangle$.\n    For our desired outcome, this state is:\n    $|\\phi_{final}\\rangle = |1, 1, -1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a system in an initial state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ to be in a final state $|\\phi_{final}\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n    $P = |\\langle \\phi_{final} | \\Psi \\rangle|^2$.\n    Substituting our states:\n    $P = |\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rules of Angular Momentum Coupling (Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients):**\n    The inner product $\\langle l_1, l_2, m_1, m_2 | l_1, l_2, l, m \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, often written as $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$. These coefficients relate the coupled basis to the uncoupled basis.\n    A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to be non-zero is that the z-component of the total angular momentum must be conserved. This means the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers must equal the total z-component quantum number:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n6.  **Check the Selection Rule for this Specific Case:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   From the final state $|1, 1, -1, -1\\rangle$, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's calculate the sum: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Now, we compare $m$ and $m_1 + m_2$. We find that $m = -1$ and $m_1 + m_2 = -2$.\n    *   Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the selection rule is violated.\n\n7.  **Determine the Final Probability:**\n    Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n    $\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n*   **Basis Representation:** The initial state is given in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), while the measurement outcome is defined in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$).\n*   **Conservation Law:** The most crucial point is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The operator for the total z-component is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The initial state is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = (-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. A measurement cannot change the value of a conserved quantity. Therefore, the probability of this transition must be zero.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The formal way to calculate the probability involves Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are zero if the conservation rule ($m=m_1+m_2$) is violated.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  Initial state total z-quantum number: $m = -1$.\n2.  Final state individual z-quantum numbers: $m_1 = -1$, $m_2 = -1$.\n3.  Sum of final state z-quantum numbers: $m_1 + m_2 = -2$.\n4.  Check for conservation: Is $m = m_1 + m_2$? No, because $-1 \\neq -2$.\n5.  Conclusion: The probability of this measurement outcome is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>",
