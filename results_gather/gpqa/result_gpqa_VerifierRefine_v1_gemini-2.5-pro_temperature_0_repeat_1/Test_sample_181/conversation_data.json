    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Mott-Gurney Equation and SCLC**\n\nThe Mott-Gurney equation, $J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$, describes the current density (J) in a specific regime known as Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC). This regime occurs in insulators or semiconductors under certain conditions. The name itself gives a major clue: the current is limited not by the material's intrinsic conductivity or the ability of the contact to inject charge, but by the build-up of charge (space charge) within the device, which creates an electric field that opposes further injection.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Assumptions for the Mott-Gurney Law**\n\nTo derive this specific equation, several simplifying assumptions must be made:\n\n1.  **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that current is transported by only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes). If both carriers were mobile (a two-carrier device), their interactions and recombination would need to be considered, leading to a much more complex model. This assumption immediately makes option (D) incorrect.\n\n2.  **Trap-Free Material:** The derivation assumes an ideal material with no defect states (traps) within the energy bandgap. If traps exist, injected carriers can be captured, reducing the number of free carriers available for conduction. This would change the relationship between J and V, often resulting in a power law $J \\propto V^m$ where m > 2. Therefore, the material must be considered \"trap-free\" for the simple $V^2$ law to hold.\n\n3.  **Ohmic or Non-Blocking Contact:** For a space charge to build up, the electrode must be able to supply more carriers than the bulk of the device can transport. This means the contact must be \"Ohmic\" in the sense that it provides a reservoir of charge with no significant energy barrier to injection. A contact with a large energy barrier (like a Schottky contact) would limit the current by injection, a phenomenon described by other models (e.g., thermionic emission), not by the Mott-Gurney law. Therefore, a \"Schottky contact\" (option C) is incorrect, and a contact with \"no carrier injection barrier\" is required.\n\n4.  **Drift Current Dominance:** The total current in a semiconductor is the sum of drift current (due to the electric field) and diffusion current (due to carrier concentration gradients). The Mott-Gurney model assumes that the applied voltage is high enough and the device is thick enough that the drift component of the current is much larger than the diffusion component. Therefore, the diffusion current is considered negligible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Option Based on the Assumptions**\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n    *   This statement is contradictory. The SCLC regime is fundamentally a **drift-dominated** current. Stating that the drift current is negligible is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   **Trap-free single-carrier device:** Correct.\n    *   **No carrier injection barrier:** Correct. This is the essential property of the contact needed for SCLC.\n    *   **Negligible diffusion current:** Correct. The model assumes drift is the dominant transport mechanism.\n    *   This statement accurately captures all the key conditions.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This is incorrect because a Schottky contact presents an energy barrier to injection, which would limit the current in a way different from the space-charge limitation described by Mott-Gurney.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law is derived for a single-carrier transport model.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the only one that correctly and completely lists the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.\n\n<<<B>>>",
