def check_chip_seq_question():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by simulating the logic
    of the biological processes involved in the ChIP-seq experiment.

    The simulation is based on the following principles:
    1.  **IKAROS Binding Sites**: As a transcription factor, IKAROS specifically binds to regulatory
        elements like promoters and enhancers to control gene expression. It does not bind randomly
        or at most repetitive elements.
    2.  **Protein Complex Formation**: Active promoters and enhancers are known to be sites where
        transcription factors assemble large, dense multi-protein complexes (e.g., with
        co-activators, Mediator, RNA Polymerase II). Other genomic regions typically do not
        have such dense complexes.
    3.  **Epitope Masking Hypothesis**: The disappearance of ChIP peaks when using a stronger,
        longer-range protein-protein cross-linker (DSG) in addition to PFA is a known
        phenomenon called epitope masking. This occurs when the target protein is so heavily
        cross-linked to its neighbors in a dense complex that the antibody can no longer access
        its binding site (epitope).

    The code evaluates which genomic location fits the experimental observation:
    - Peak is present with PFA-only fixation.
    - Peak is absent with PFA+DSG fixation.
