    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the probability of a sequence of two quantum measurements. First, the observable P is measured, and we want the outcome to be 0. Immediately after, the observable Q is measured on the new state, and we want the outcome to be -1. The total probability is the product of the probability of the first event and the conditional probability of the second event.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   **Initial state vector `|ψ>`:**\n    `|ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   **Operator for observable P:**\n    `P =`\n    `[0,     1/√2, 0    ]`\n    `[1/√2,  0,    1/√2 ]`\n    `[0,     1/√2, 0    ]`\n*   **Operator for observable Q:**\n    `Q =`\n    `[1,  0,  0]`\n    `[0,  0,  0]`\n    `[0,  0, -1]`\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step A: Analyze the First Measurement (P=0)**\n\n*   **Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.** The possible outcomes of measuring P are its eigenvalues. We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `p=0`.\n    *   The characteristic equation is `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n        `det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]) = 0`\n        `-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0`\n        `-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n        `λ - λ³ = 0  => λ(1 - λ²)=0`\n    *   The eigenvalues are `λ = 0, 1, -1`. The desired outcome `p=0` is a valid eigenvalue.\n\n*   **Find the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue `p=0`**. Let's call this `|v_p=0>`.\n    *   We solve the equation `P|v> = 0|v>`.\n        `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n    *   This gives the equations:\n        1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n        2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n    *   The eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. To normalize it, we choose a value for x, say `x=1`. The vector is `[1, 0, -1]^T`.\n    *   The norm is `sqrt(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2`.\n    *   The normalized eigenvector is `|v_p=0> = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0.**\n    *   The probability is given by `Prob(P=0) = |<v_p=0|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>`.\n    *   First, calculate the inner product `<v_p=0|ψ>`:\n        `<v_p=0|ψ> = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] * [-1, 2, 1]^T = (1/√2) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√2) * (-2) = -√2`.\n    *   Next, calculate the squared norm of the initial state, `<ψ|ψ>`:\n        `<ψ|ψ> = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    *   Now, find the probability:\n        `Prob(P=0) = |-√2|² / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1/3`.\n\n**Step B: Analyze the Second Measurement (Q=-1)**\n\n*   **Determine the state after the first measurement.** When P is measured and the result is 0, the system's state collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector `|v_p=0>`.\n    *   The new state is `|ψ'> = |v_p=0> = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n*   **Find the normalized eigenvector of Q for the eigenvalue `q=-1`**. Let's call this `|v_q=-1>`.\n    *   The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `1, 0, -1`. The desired outcome `q=-1` is a valid eigenvalue.\n    *   The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. For the eigenvalue `q=-1`, the eigenvector is `[0, 0, 1]^T`.\n    *   This vector is already normalized. So, `|v_q=-1> = [0, 0, 1]^T`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1 in the new state `|ψ'>`**.\n    *   This conditional probability is `Prob(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'>) = |<v_q=-1|ψ'>|²`.\n    *   Calculate the inner product `<v_q=-1|ψ'>`:\n        `<v_q=-1|ψ'> = [0, 0, 1] * (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T = (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`.\n    *   Now, find the probability:\n        `Prob(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'>) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`.\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Total Probability**\n\n*   The total probability of the sequence of events is the product of the probabilities calculated in Step A and Step B.\n    *   `Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'>)`\n    *   `Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **State Collapse:** The most crucial concept is that after the first measurement, the state of the system changes (collapses) to the eigenvector corresponding to the measured value. The second probability must be calculated using this new state.\n2.  **Normalization:** Probabilities are calculated using normalized vectors. The formula `|<a|b>|²` assumes `|a>` and `|b>` are normalized. If not, you must divide by the norms, as in `|<a|b>|² / (<a|a><b|b>)`. In our calculation for `Prob(P=0)`, we explicitly divided by `<ψ|ψ>`.\n3.  **Order of Operations:** The order of measurements matters. Measuring Q first and then P would likely yield a different result.\n4.  **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:** Correctly calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for each operator is fundamental to finding the possible outcomes and the states they correspond to.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3. After this measurement, the state collapses. The probability of then measuring Q=-1 in this new state is 1/2. The total probability for this sequence is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>",
