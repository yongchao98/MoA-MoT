    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem involves a sequence of two measurements on a quantum system.
    1.  Define the initial state and operators.
    2.  Calculate the probability of the first measurement (P=0).
    3.  Determine the state of the system after the first measurement (state collapse).
    4.  Calculate the probability of the second measurement (Q=-1) on the new state.
    5.  Compute the total probability by multiplying the probabilities from steps 2 and 4.
    6.  Compare the final result with the provided answer.
