    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Problem**\nThe scientist wants to synthesize branched polyethylene using only ethylene as the monomer. Standard high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is linear. To introduce branches, a comonomer, typically an alpha-olefin like 1-butene or 1-hexene, is needed to make linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE). Since the problem states that only ethylene is used as a reactant, the branching comonomer must be generated *in situ* from ethylene itself. This requires a dual-catalyst or tandem system:\n*   **Catalyst 1 (Polymerization Catalyst):** The original catalyst that polymerizes ethylene to form the main polymer chain. It must also be able to incorporate alpha-olefins.\n*   **Catalyst 2 (Oligomerization Catalyst):** The new catalyst to be added. Its job is to take ethylene molecules and combine them into short alpha-olefins (e.g., dimerize two ethylenes to 1-butene, or trimerize three ethylenes to 1-hexene).\n\nThese newly formed alpha-olefins then act as comonomers with the remaining ethylene, and Catalyst 1 incorporates them into the growing polymer chains, creating regular, short-chain branches.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Statement**\n\nLet's evaluate the four statements provided by the senior scientist in the context of this tandem catalysis process.\n\n*   **Statement A: \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** The oligomerization of ethylene can be catalyzed by various transition metals. Catalysts based on late transition metals like nickel (Group 10) and palladium (Group 10, a noble metal) are well-known for this reaction. For example, the Shell Higher Olefin Process (SHOP) uses a nickel catalyst. Palladium-based systems also exist. These metals, particularly palladium, are considered noble or precious metals and are significantly more expensive than early transition metals like titanium or chromium, making them less economically viable for producing a bulk commodity polymer like polyethylene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This statement is factually correct. Such catalysts exist, and their high cost is a major barrier to industrial use.\n\n*   **Statement B: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** Group VIa (or Group 6 in modern IUPAC nomenclature) includes chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W). Chromium-based catalysts are particularly famous and highly effective for the selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene. This is the key technology behind the most successful industrial tandem processes. These organometallic catalysts are not active on their own and require a cocatalyst or \"activator,\" typically an organoaluminum compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This statement is factually correct and describes the core chemistry of the most important industrial solution to the scientist's problem.\n\n*   **Statement C: \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** The technology combining an ethylene trimerization catalyst (like the chromium-based one from statement B) with a polymerization catalyst in a single reactor is a well-established industrial process. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, a US-based company, operates this technology on a very large industrial scale at their facilities in the United States (e.g., in Texas).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This statement is factually correct.\n\n*   **Statement D: \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene (e.g., trimerization to 1-hexene). As mentioned in the analysis of statement B, the chromium catalysts used for this step require an activator. The most common and effective activators are aluminum-based compounds, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), or triethylaluminum (TEAL). Far from \"not working,\" they are essential for the catalyst's function.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This statement is factually incorrect.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Best Answer**\nWe have identified that statements A, B, and C are all factually correct, while D is incorrect. In a single-choice question, we must select the *best* or *most relevant* correct answer.\n\n*   Statement D is definitively wrong.\n*   Statements A, B, and C are all correct facts related to the topic.\n*   Statement A describes an alternative, less common chemical route.\n*   Statement B describes the fundamental chemistry of the most successful and industrially relevant route.\n*   Statement C describes the commercial status, which is a direct result of the success of the chemistry described in Statement B.\n\nThe question is posed from the perspective of a scientist in a research lab trying to design a new catalytic system. The most crucial piece of information for this task is *how* to achieve the desired chemical transformation. Statement B provides this key chemical principle by identifying the specific class of metal (Group VIa) that is highly effective for the required oligomerization step. While A and C are also true, B is the most fundamental and instructive statement regarding the chemistry of the solution. The industrial implementation (C) is a consequence of the principle in B being true and effective.\n\nTherefore, Statement B is the most appropriate and central correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
