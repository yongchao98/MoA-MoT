    # where the rest mass of the electron/positron (m_e) is 1 and the speed of
    # light (c) is 1. The final result (the angle) is dimensionless and
    # independent of the choice of units.

    # The photons move at angles +theta and -theta relative to the x-axis.
    # The y-components of their momenta cancel out: p_photon*sin(theta) - p_photon*sin(theta) = 0.
    # This is consistent with p_initial_total_y = 0.
    
    # The x-components of their momenta add up and must equal the total initial x-momentum.
