    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the angle between the two photons.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principles:**\n    This problem involves a relativistic particle collision resulting in annihilation. The fundamental principles that govern this interaction are the conservation of total energy and the conservation of total momentum. Since the particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light (indicated by Lorentz factors > 1), we must use relativistic formulas.\n\n2.  **Define the Initial State (Before Collision):**\n    Let's set the horizontal axis as the x-axis. The electron moves from left to right (in the +x direction), and the positron moves from right to left (in the -x direction).\n    *   Let $m_e$ be the rest mass of the electron and positron.\n    *   Let $c$ be the speed of light.\n\n    **For the Electron (e-):**\n    *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n    *   Relativistic energy, $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Relativistic momentum can be found using the energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n        *   $p_e c = \\sqrt{E_e^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(4 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{16 - 1} \\cdot m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{15} m_e c^2$.\n        *   So, the momentum is $p_e = \\sqrt{15} m_e c$.\n        *   As a vector, $\\vec{p}_e = (\\sqrt{15} m_e c, 0)$.\n\n    **For the Positron (e+):**\n    *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n    *   Relativistic energy, $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Relativistic momentum:\n        *   $p_p c = \\sqrt{E_p^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(2 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{4 - 1} \\cdot m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{3} m_e c^2$.\n        *   So, the momentum is $p_p = \\sqrt{3} m_e c$.\n        *   Since it moves in the opposite direction, its momentum vector is $\\vec{p}_p = (-\\sqrt{3} m_e c, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   **Total Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n        $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum ($\\vec{p}_{initial}$):**\n        $\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_e + \\vec{p}_p = (\\sqrt{15} m_e c, 0) + (-\\sqrt{3} m_e c, 0) = ((\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Define the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    The final state consists of two photons.\n    *   The problem states their energies are equal. Let's call this energy $E_\\gamma$.\n    *   The directions are \"upper-right\" and \"lower-right\", which implies they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. Let the angle one photon makes with the +x axis be $\\theta$, and the other be $-\\theta$.\n    *   For a photon, the relationship between energy and momentum is $E = pc$, so the momentum magnitude of each photon is $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c$.\n    *   The momentum vectors of the two photons are:\n        *   $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma 1} = (\\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\cos\\theta, \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\sin\\theta)$\n        *   $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma 2} = (\\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\cos(-\\theta), \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\sin(-\\theta)) = (\\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\cos\\theta, -\\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\sin\\theta)$\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:**\n        *   $E_{final} = E_{initial}$\n        *   $E_\\gamma + E_\\gamma = 6 m_e c^2$\n        *   $2 E_\\gamma = 6 m_e c^2 \\implies E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n        *   Each photon has an energy of $3 m_e c^2$.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n        *   $\\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{initial}$\n        *   The total final momentum is $\\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\gamma 1} + \\vec{p}_{\\gamma 2} = (2 \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\cos\\theta, 0)$.\n        *   Equating the initial and final momentum vectors:\n            $(2 \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\cos\\theta, 0) = ((\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c, 0)$.\n        *   From the x-component, we get the equation:\n            $2 \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\cos\\theta = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    *   Substitute the value we found for $E_\\gamma$ into the momentum equation:\n        $2 \\frac{(3 m_e c^2)}{c} \\cos\\theta = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        $6 m_e c \\cos\\theta = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n    *   Cancel the common factor $m_e c$ from both sides:\n        $6 \\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}$.\n    *   Solve for $\\cos\\theta$:\n        $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$.\n    *   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n        *   $\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.8730$\n        *   $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.7321$\n        *   $\\cos\\theta \\approx \\frac{3.8730 - 1.7321}{6} = \\frac{2.1409}{6} \\approx 0.3568$.\n    *   Find the angle $\\theta$ by taking the inverse cosine:\n        $\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.09^\\circ$.\n\n7.  **Find the Final Answer:**\n    The question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons.
