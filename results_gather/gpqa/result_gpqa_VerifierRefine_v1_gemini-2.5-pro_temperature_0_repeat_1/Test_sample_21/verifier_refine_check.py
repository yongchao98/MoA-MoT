Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.

### Step 1: Analyze the first part of the statement (Thermodynamics)

The first part of the statement is: "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions."

*   **Core Concept:** The thermodynamic strength of an oxidizing agent (oxidant) is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive (higher) E° value indicates a stronger oxidant, meaning it has a greater tendency to be reduced (accept electrons).
*   **Relevant Half-Reactions:** We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in basic solution to its potential in acidic solution.
    *   **In acidic solution:** O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)
        *   The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +1.23 V**.
    *   **In basic solution:** O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)
        *   The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +0.40 V**.
*   **Comparison and Conclusion:**
    *   Comparing the two values, +0.40 V (basic) is significantly lower than +1.23 V (acidic).
    *   Since a lower reduction potential means a weaker oxidizing agent, oxygen is thermodynamically a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.
*   **Careful Point:** The options "weaker/stronger" imply a comparison. The natural comparison is between acidic and basic conditions, which are the two standard environments in electrochemistry.

### Step 2: Analyze the second part of the statement (Kinetics)

The second part of the statement is: "Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions."

*   **Core Concept:** Kinetics deals with the rate of a reaction. A reaction can be thermodynamically favorable (spontaneous) but kinetically slow if it has a high activation energy. The options "faster/slower" imply a comparison of reaction rates between acidic and basic solutions.
*   **The Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR):** The reduction of oxygen is a complex, multi-step, four-electron process. It involves breaking the strong O=O double bond, which is energetically costly and leads to a high activation energy. Consequently, the oxygen reduction reaction is notoriously slow, or "kinetically sluggish," in most conditions. This is a major challenge in technologies like fuel cells, where a large "overpotential" is needed to make the reaction proceed at a useful rate.
*   **Comparison of Rates in Acidic vs. Basic Solutions:**
    *   While the reaction is slow in both media, there is a difference.
    *   In acidic solutions, anions from the acid (e.g., SO₄²⁻, ClO₄⁻) can adsorb onto the surface of the electrode catalyst (like platinum), blocking active sites and further slowing down the reaction. This is known as "anion poisoning."
    *   For many common catalysts, the reaction mechanism is found to be more facile (i.e., faster) in alkaline (basic) media than in acidic media.
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions.
*   **Careful Point:** Do not confuse thermodynamic favorability with kinetic speed. Even though oxygen is a much stronger oxidant thermodynamically in acid (E° = +1.23 V), its reaction is kinetically slower than in base.

### Step 3: Combine the conclusions and select the final answer

*   From Step 1, the first blank should be **weaker**. This eliminates options A and C.
*   From Step 2, the second blank should be **slower**. This eliminates option D.
*   The only remaining option is B, which combines "weaker" and "slower".

Let's check the complete statement with this combination:
"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions."
This statement is consistent with the principles of electrochemistry.
