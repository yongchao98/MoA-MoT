    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Functional Groups and Basic Structure**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group is confirmed. An ester group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms (-COO-).\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify Substituents**\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum provides detailed information about the hydrogen atoms (protons) in the molecule and their local environments.\n\n*   **Aromatic-H Signals (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that these 4 protons give only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, specifically a *para* (1,4) substitution. In a 1,4-disubstituted ring with two different substituents, the four protons are chemically non-equivalent but form a symmetrical AA'BB' system, which often appears as two distinct signals (typically two doublets). This accounts for a **C6H4** fragment.\n\n*   **Vinyl-H Signals (2 signals):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H).\n    *   **Signal 1 (doublet):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to (is adjacent to) only one other proton.\n    *   **Signal 2 (doublet of quartets):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet splitting) and a group of three equivalent protons (a -CH3 group, giving the quartet splitting).\n    *   This specific splitting pattern (a doublet and a doublet of quartets for two vinyl protons) is a classic signature of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The proton on the carbon with the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton and the methyl protons (doublet of quartets). The other vinyl proton is split only by its vinyl neighbor (doublet). This fragment accounts for **C3H5** (1 vinyl-H + 1 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n\n*   **-CH3 Group Signals (2 signals):** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl groups.\n    *   **Methyl 1:** We have already identified one methyl group as part of the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-**CH3**).\n    *   **Methyl 2:** There must be a second, separate **-CH3** group elsewhere in the molecule. This methyl group must be part of the ester.\n\n*   **No -CH2 Signals:** This is a crucial piece of information. The molecule contains no methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nLet's gather all the pieces we have identified:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring: **C6H4**\n2.  An ester group: **-COO-** (contains C and O2)\n3.  A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3** (contains C3H5)\n4.  A second methyl group: **-CH3** (contains CH3)\n\nNow, let's put them together. The benzene ring has two substituents. These must be the propenyl group and the ester group. The second methyl group must be the \"R'\" part of the ester. There are two ways to connect the ester:\n\n*   **Possibility A:** The benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon of the ester. The structure is Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n    *   Structure: (CH3-CH=CH) - C6H4 - COO - CH3\n*   **Possibility B:** The benzene ring is attached to the oxygen of the ester. The structure is 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n    *   Structure: (CH3-CH=CH) - C6H4 - O - CO - CH3\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Chemical Formula**\n\nLet's calculate the total number of atoms for either of the valid structures derived above.\n\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 C\n    *   From the benzene ring (C6H4): 6 C\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-CH3 or -O-CO-CH3): 2 C\n    *   **Total Carbon = 3 + 6 + 2 = 11**\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 5 H\n    *   From the benzene ring (C6H4): 4 H\n    *   From the second methyl group (-CH3): 3 H\n    *   **Total Hydrogen = 5 + 4 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2 O\n    *   **Total Oxygen = 2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) C12H14O2\n*   B) C12H12O2\n*   C) C11H12O2\n*   D) C11H14O2\n\nOur derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C. Let's quickly check why the others are incorrect.\n*   A) C12H14O2 and D) C11H14O2: Both have 14 hydrogens. To get from H12 to H14, you would need to add two hydrogens, which would likely involve converting a double bond to a single bond and creating a -CH2- group (e.g., a propyl group instead of propenyl). The problem states there are no -CH2- groups.\n*   B) C12H12O2: This formula has an extra carbon atom compared to our derived structure, without changing the hydrogen count. This would require an additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., another C=C bond or a ring), which is inconsistent with the fragments identified from the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a corrected step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nFirst, we determine the required Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) from the structural features described:\n*   A 6-membered aromatic ring has a DBE of 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n*   An ester group (R-COO-R') contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which contributes 1 to the DBE.\n*   The presence of vinyl-H signals in the 1H NMR spectrum indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which contributes 1 to the DBE.\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = 6.**\n\nNow, we calculate the DBE for each of the given options using the formula DBE = C + 1 - (H/2):\n*   A) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6\n*   B) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n*   C) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6\n*   D) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n\nBased on the DBE calculation, we can eliminate options B and D. The correct formula must be either A (C12H14O2) or C (C11H12O2).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify Fragments**\n\nWe use the detailed NMR data to build the molecular structure.\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical, 1,4-(para) substitution pattern. This identifies a **C6H4** fragment.\n*   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. One vinyl proton is split only by its vinyl neighbor (giving a doublet). The other vinyl proton is split by its vinyl neighbor (doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment is **C3H5**.\n*   **-CH3 Groups (2 signals):** One methyl signal belongs to the propenyl group just identified. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group.\n*   **No -CH2 Groups:** This is a critical constraint. The ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-OCH2CH3) or have any other methylene groups. Therefore, the second methyl group must be either from a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). In either case, this fragment is **C2H3O2**.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula**\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n1.  Aromatic ring: **C6H4**\n2.  Propenyl group: **C3H5**\n3.  Methyl ester or acetate group: **C2H3O2**\n\n*   **Total Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe chemical formula derived from a structure that fits all the spectroscopic data is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with Plausible Options and Conclude**\n\nThe derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\nLet's re-evaluate option A (C12H14O2). This formula has the correct DBE of 6. However, its composition is C11H12O2 + CH2. To form a valid structure for C12H14O2 based on the NMR fragments (e.g., by changing the methyl ester to an ethyl ester), a -CH2- group would have to be introduced. This directly contradicts the explicit constraint that there are no signals for -CH2- groups in the spectrum. No other plausible structure for C12H14O2 fits the highly specific vinyl proton splitting pattern without containing a -CH2- group.\n\nTherefore, C11H12O2 is the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided information (FTIR, aromaticity, and all details of the 1H NMR spectrum including splitting patterns and the absence of specific signals).\n\n<<<C>>>"
