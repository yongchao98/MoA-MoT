    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Vector Field**\n\nThe problem states that the vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and is directed radially outward from the origin. In vector notation using spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Integral to be Evaluated**\n\nWe need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this vector field, `∇ . f`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The integral is:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Vector Field and Choose a Method**\n\nA crucial point to notice is that the vector field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat` is singular at the origin (`r = 0`), as the magnitude `1/r^2` becomes infinite. The origin is inside our volume of integration.\n\nThere are two common methods to solve this:\n\n1.  **Direct calculation of the divergence:** This can be tricky due to the singularity.\n2.  **Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):** This is often the most straightforward method for this type of problem.\n\nWe will use the Divergence Theorem as it elegantly handles the singularity.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outward from the surface.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Surface Integral (Flux)**\n\nWe need to calculate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, `∮_S (f . dS)`.\n\n1.  **On the surface `S`:** The radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n2.  **The surface element `dS`:** For a sphere, the outward-pointing normal is always in the radial direction. Therefore, the vector surface element is `dS = dS * r_hat`, where `dS` is the scalar area element.\n3.  **The dot product `f . dS`:**\n    `f . dS = ((1/R^2) * r_hat) . (dS * r_hat)`\n    Since `r_hat . r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    `f . dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n4.  **The integral:** Now we substitute this back into the surface integral:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n    Since `R` is a constant over the entire surface, we can take `1/R^2` outside the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n5.  **Total Surface Area:** The integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere. The formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2) = 4π`\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = 4π`\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n\n*   **Recognize the Singularity:** The most common mistake is to calculate the divergence of `f` directly. The divergence of `(1/r^2) * r_hat` is `0` for all `r ≠ 0`. If one incorrectly assumes this is true everywhere, the integral would be `0` (Option D). However, the divergence is undefined at the singularity `r=0`, and its integral over any volume containing the origin is non-zero.\n*   **Use the Divergence Theorem:** The theorem provides a robust way to find the value of the integral by converting it to a surface integral on the boundary, where the field is well-behaved.\n*   **Vector Nature of `dS`:** Remember that `dS` is a vector pointing normal to the surface. For a sphere, this direction is `r_hat`.\n*   **Physical Analogy (Gauss's Law):** This problem is mathematically identical to finding the total charge inside a sphere given an electric field `E = (q / (4πε₀)) * (1/r^2) * r_hat`. By Gauss's Law, the flux `∮ E . dS` is `q/ε₀`. Our field `f` is analogous to `E` if `q / (4πε₀) = 1`. The integral `∫ (∇ . f) dV` is analogous to finding the total \"source strength\", which corresponds to `4π * (q / (4πε₀)) = 4π`.\n\nThe calculated value is `4π`, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
