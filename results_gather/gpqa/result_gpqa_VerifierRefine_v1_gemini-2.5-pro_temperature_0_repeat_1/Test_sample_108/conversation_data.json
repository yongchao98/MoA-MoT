    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the permitted and non-permitted transitions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n1.  **Initial State (NN system): `1S0`**\n    *   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the initial total spin of the two nucleons is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` implies the initial orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` implies the initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial NN state is `P_i(NN) = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n2.  **Decay Process**\n    *   The process is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   The emitted particle `X` has an intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The orbital angular momentum of `X` relative to the final NN system is denoted by `l_X` (where `s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3`, etc.).\n\n3.  **Conservation Laws**\n    *   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial total angular momentum `J_i` must equal the final total angular momentum `J_f`.\n        *   `J_i = 0`.\n        *   The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum `J_f(NN)` and the orbital angular momentum of particle `X`, `l_X`.\n        *   So, `J_i = J_f(NN) + l_X` (vector sum).\n        *   For the sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f(NN) = l_X`.\n    *   **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial total parity `P_i` must equal the final total parity `P_f`.\n        *   `P_i = P_i(NN) = +1`.\n        *   The final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_f = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^(l_X)`.\n        *   `P_f(NN) = (-1)^(L_f(NN))`, where `L_f(NN)` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.\n        *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n        *   So, `P_f = (-1)^(L_f(NN)) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = (-1)^(L_f(NN) + l_X + 1)`.\n        *   Equating `P_i` and `P_f`: `+1 = (-1)^(L_f(NN) + l_X + 1)`.\n        *   This implies that the exponent `L_f(NN) + l_X + 1` must be an even number.\n        *   Therefore, `L_f(NN) + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### Step 2: Apply Pauli Statistics to the Final State\n\n1.  **Pauli Principle for Nucleons:** The problem provides the condition that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is a statement of the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons, which requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric.\n2.  **Given Condition:** The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n3.  **Applying the Condition:** We substitute `T_f(NN) = 0` into the Pauli rule:\n    *   `0 = S_f(NN) + L_f(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This means that `S_f(NN) + L_f(NN) + 1` must be an even number (or zero).\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S_f(NN) + L_f(NN)` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### Step 3: Summarize the Conditions for a Permitted Transition\n\nA transition `1S0 -> (2S_f+1)L_f(J_f) + l_X` is permitted only if all three of the following conditions are met:\n1.  **Angular Momentum:** `J_f = l_X`\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n3.  **Pauli/Isospin:** `S_f + L_f` must be **odd** (because `T_f=0`).\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these three conditions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `3 = 3`. (Pass)\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (Pass)\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. (Pass)\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Pass)\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (Fail)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli statistics condition for a `T=0` final state.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. (Pass)\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. (Pass)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted by all the rules given in the problem. (Note: A two-nucleon system cannot have S=3, so the state is physically impossible, but it does not violate the specific conservation and statistical rules being tested).\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (Pass)\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe only option that fails to satisfy the given conditions is B, as it violates the Pauli principle for a final state with `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n<<<B>>>",
