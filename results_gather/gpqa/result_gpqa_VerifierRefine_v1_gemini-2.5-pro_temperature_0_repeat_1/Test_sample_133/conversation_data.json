    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:** We are mixing two strong acids (HCl and H₂SO₄) with one strong base (Ba(OH)₂).\n2.  **Nature of Reactants:**\n    *   HCl is a monoprotic acid, meaning 1 mole of HCl provides 1 mole of H⁺ ions.\n    *   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, meaning 1 mole of H₂SO₄ provides 2 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a diacidic base, meaning 1 mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻ ions.\n3.  **Core Reaction:** The primary reaction is neutralization: H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l).\n4.  **Standard Enthalpy of Neutralization:** For the reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, the enthalpy change (ΔH_neut) is approximately constant at -57.1 kJ/mol or -13.7 kcal/mol. The options are in kcal, so we will use the kcal value.\n5.  **Limiting Reactant:** The total amount of heat released depends on the limiting reactant, which is the ion (H⁺ or OH⁻) that gets completely consumed.\n6.  **Side Reactions:** A precipitation reaction occurs between Ba²⁺ ions from Ba(OH)₂ and SO₄²⁻ ions from H₂SO₄ to form BaSO₄(s). However, the question specifically asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization,\" which refers only to the heat released from the formation of water. Therefore, we should ignore the heat from precipitation.\n7.  **Units:** Ensure all volumes are converted to Liters (L) for molarity calculations.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total moles of H⁺ ions.**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since HCl is monoprotic, moles of H⁺ from HCl = 0.10 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol.\n\n*   **Total moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total moles H⁺ = (moles from HCl) + (moles from H₂SO₄) = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = **0.28 mol H⁺**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total moles of OH⁻ ions.**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**\n    *   Volume = 200 mL = 0.200 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.5 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume = 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ is diacidic, moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol OH⁻**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the limiting reactant.**\n\n*   The neutralization reaction is H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O, which occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   We have 0.28 mol of H⁺ and 0.20 mol of OH⁻.\n*   Since the moles of OH⁻ (0.20 mol) are less than the moles of H⁺ (0.28 mol), **OH⁻ is the limiting reactant**.\n*   This means that 0.20 mol of OH⁻ will react completely with 0.20 mol of H⁺.\n*   The number of moles of water formed will be equal to the moles of the limiting reactant, which is 0.20 mol.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization.**\n\n*   The heat released is calculated by multiplying the moles of water formed by the standard enthalpy of neutralization.\n*   Standard ΔH_neut ≈ -13.7 kcal/mol. (Sometimes a value of -13.6 kcal/mol is used, which seems to be the case for this problem based on the options).\n*   Enthalpy change (ΔH) = Moles of H₂O formed × ΔH_neut\n*   ΔH = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol)\n*   ΔH = -2.72 kcal\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of neutralization is -2.72 kcal.
