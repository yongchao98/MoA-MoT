    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, which can be expressed as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n\n    The ratio is:\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   The star's temperature (T_star) and radius (R_star) are the same for both planets, so these terms cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2), so the (1 - A)^(1/4) term also cancels out.\n    *   The constant '2' inside the square root cancels out.\n\n    After simplification, the ratio becomes:\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(1 / a1) / sqrt(1 / a2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n    **Careful Point:** The final temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits. We must now find this ratio.\n\n5.  **Find the Semi-major Axes (a1 and a2):** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K = (m_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    Where:\n    *   m_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n\n    **Careful Point:** Since the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination `i` is very close to 90°, and therefore sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\n    K ≈ (m_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-major Axis (a):** We need to rearrange the formula to solve for `a`.\n    K² = (m_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K² = (m_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a = (m_p² * G) / (M_star * K²)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes (a2 / a1):** Now we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes using the formula derived in the previous step.\n    a2 / a1 = [(m_p2² * G) / (M_star * K2²)] / [(m_p1² * G) / (M_star * K1²)]\n\n    **Careful Point:** The star's mass (M_star) and the gravitational constant (G) are the same for both calculations, so they cancel out.\n    a2 / a1 = (m_p2² / K2²) / (m_p1² / K1²)\n    a2 / a1 = (m_p2 / m_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n8.  **Determine the Ratio of Radial Velocities (K1 / K2):** The radial velocity (v_r) is related to the Doppler shift (Δλ) by the formula v_r = c * (Δλ / λ₀). The RV semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum radial velocity, so K = c * (Δλ_max / λ₀).\n    The ratio K1 / K2 is:\n    K1 / K2 = [c * (Δλ_max1 / λ₀)] / [c * (Δλ_max2 / λ₀)]\n    The speed of light (c) and the rest wavelength (λ₀) cancel out.\n    K1 / K2 = Δλ_max1 / Δλ_max2\n\n    Using the given values:\n    *   Δλ_max1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ_max2 = 0.04 Å\n    *   K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n9.  **Substitute Values and Calculate a2 / a1:** We have the necessary ratios:\n    *   Mass ratio: m_p2 / m_p1 = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5 / 7\n    *   RV ratio: K1 / K2 = 3 / 4\n\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for the ratio of semi-major axes:\n    a2 / a1 = (m_p2 / m_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Finally, substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the simplified temperature ratio formula from Step 4.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n    Now, calculate the decimal value:\n    15 ÷ 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\n11. **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536, which corresponds to option D.
