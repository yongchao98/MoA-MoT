    # --- Step 1: Define the relationship for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures ---
    # The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:
    # T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))
    # where 'a' is the semi-major axis.
    # Since the star's properties (T_star, R_star) and the albedo (A) are the same for both planets,
    # the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 simplifies to:
    # T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)
    # This matches the LLM's derivation.

    # --- Step 2: Define the relationship for the ratio of semi-major axes ---
    # The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a circular orbit, assuming the inclination i~90 degrees (sin(i)~1)
    # due to transit detection, is given by:
    # K ≈ (m_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)
    # Solving for 'a' gives: a ≈ (m_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K^2)
    # The ratio a2 / a1 simplifies because the star's mass (M_star) and the gravitational constant (G) cancel out:
    # a2 / a1 = (m_p2^2 / K2^2) / (m_p1^2 / K1^2)
    # a2 / a1 = (m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2
    # This also matches the LLM's derivation.

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the required intermediate ratios ---
    # The ratio of radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 / K2) is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2),
    # since K = c * (Δλ_max / λ₀), and c and λ₀ are constants that cancel out.

    mass_ratio_p2_over_p1 = m_p2 / m_p1
