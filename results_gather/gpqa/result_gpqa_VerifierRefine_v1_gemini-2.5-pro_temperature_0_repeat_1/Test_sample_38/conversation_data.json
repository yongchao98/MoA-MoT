    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of \"a\".\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Principle**\n\nThe fundamental principle we need to use is the **normalization of the wave function**. In quantum mechanics, the wave function, ψ(x), contains information about a particle. The square of its magnitude, |ψ(x)|², represents the probability density of finding the particle at a specific position x. The total probability of finding the particle somewhere in all possible space must be 1 (or 100%). This is expressed mathematically as:\n\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nThe integral is taken over all space where the particle can exist.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Wave Function and its Boundaries**\n\n*   The wave function is given as: ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n*   The problem states that particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. This means the probability of finding the particle outside this range is zero. Therefore, our integration limits are from 1 to 3.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability Density Function, |ψ(x)|²**\n\nThe wave function is a complex number of the form z = u + iv, where 'u' is the real part and 'v' is the imaginary part. The square of its magnitude is |z|² = u² + v².\n\n*   Real part, u(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n*   Imaginary part, v(x) = -0.5\n\nNow, we calculate |ψ(x)|²:\n|ψ(x)|² = [u(x)]² + [v(x)]²\n|ψ(x)|² = [ a / sqrt(1 + x) ]² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**Step 4: Set up and Solve the Normalization Integral**\n\nWe now apply the normalization condition from Step 1 using the limits from Step 2 and the probability density from Step 3.\n\n∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n*   **Part 1: Integrate the first term**\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx = a² * ∫ [from 1 to 3] ( 1 / (1 + x) ) dx\n    The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\n    = a² * [ ln(1 + x) ] evaluated from 1 to 3\n    = a² * [ ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) ]\n    = a² * [ ln(4) - ln(2) ]\n    Using the logarithm rule ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n    = a² * ln(4/2)\n    = a² * ln(2)\n\n*   **Part 2: Integrate the second term**\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 0.25 * [ x ] evaluated from 1 to 3\n    = 0.25 * (3 - 1)\n    = 0.25 * 2\n    = 0.5\n\n**Step 5: Solve for \"a\"**\n\nNow, substitute the results from the integrations back into the main equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we solve for 'a':\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\nNow, take the square root to find 'a':\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.8494\n\nThis value is extremely close to 0.85.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n1.  **Probability Density:** The probability is related to |ψ|², not ψ itself or ψ². For a complex function ψ = u + iv, |ψ|² is u² + v², not u² - v² or something else.\n2.  **Integration Limits:** The problem explicitly gives the boundaries [1, 3]. Using any other limits would be incorrect.\n3.  **The Ensemble Size (10,000):** This number is included to emphasize that the probabilistic nature of the wave function is physically real and observable with many measurements. It does not enter into the calculation for the normalization constant 'a', which is a property of the wave function for a single system.\n4.  **Logarithm Rules:** Correctly applying the rule ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B) simplifies the calculation.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nThe calculation shows that `a` is approximately 0.8494. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 0.6\nB) 1.1\nC) 0.85\nD) 0.35\n\nThe closest option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
