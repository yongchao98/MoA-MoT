    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\nThe formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, X is the number of halogens, and N is the number of nitrogens.\n*   C = 9, H = 11, N = 1, O = 2\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n*   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (like C=O) or another ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** This characteristic doublet (two bands) is indicative of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from the usual ~1740 cm-1).\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of a primary amine and a carbonyl group is a key piece of information. The carbonyl is likely an ester due to its frequency and the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** This methyl group is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2), which is a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** A methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** This methylene group is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3), which is a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Combined Analysis:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet is very high (4.5 ppm). This indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester functional group (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH or -NH groups. The integration of 2H, combined with the IR data, confirms this is the primary amine (-NH2) group. The chemical shift is appropriate for an amine attached to an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Four protons in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shifts give information about the substituents. The doublet at a lower field (8.0 ppm) is deshielded, meaning it is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). The doublet at a higher field (7.0 ppm) is shielded, meaning it is adjacent to an electron-donating group (EDG).\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure**\n1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n3.  The amine group (-NH2) is an electron-donating group (EDG).\n4.  The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n5.  Placing the EDG and EWG at the 1 and 4 positions on the ring explains the NMR spectrum: The protons next to the -NH2 group appear upfield (~7.0 ppm), and the protons next to the -COOCH2CH3 group appear downfield (~8.0 ppm).\n6.  This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**Step 5: Verify with the Options**\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ester linkage is different (Ar-O-CO-R). The NMR for the ethyl part would be different (quartet around 2.5 ppm).\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted amide. The IR and NMR aromatic patterns do not match.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide. The IR would show only one N-H band, and the NMR would have a formyl proton (H-C=O). This does not match.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: the primary amine doublet and conjugated ester in the IR; the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-disubstituted aromatic patterns in the NMR. The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is also correct.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is a characteristic doublet for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is consistent with an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded by an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), while the protons at 7.0 ppm are shielded by an electron-donating group (EDG).\n*   **Aliphatic/Functional Group Region:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene (-CH2-) group is attached to an oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group, which is consistent with the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n*   The pieces are: a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   The -NH2 group is an EDG, and the -COOCH2CH3 group is an EWG.\n*   Placing the EDG (-NH2) and EWG (-COOCH2CH3) in a para arrangement on the benzene ring explains the NMR aromatic signals perfectly. The protons adjacent to the -NH2 group are shielded (appear at 7.0 ppm), and the protons adjacent to the ester group are deshielded (appear at 8.0 ppm).\n*   This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verifying the Options**\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the NMR for the propionate group (-O-CO-CH2CH3) would show a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted amide. The aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex, not two doublets.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide. The IR would show only one N-H band, and the NMR would lack the -NH2 signal.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all spectral data (IR, NMR) and the molecular formula (C9H11NO2).\n\n<<<D>>>"
