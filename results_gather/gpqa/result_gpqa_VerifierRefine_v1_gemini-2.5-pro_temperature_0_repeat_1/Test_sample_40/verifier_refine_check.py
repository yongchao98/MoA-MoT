    This function verifies the answer to the special relativity problem by

    The problem asks for the speed of light in a moving glass (refractive index n, velocity v)
    relative to a laboratory observer, with c=1.

    The correct derivation uses the relativistic velocity addition formula:
    u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)
    where u' is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, given by u' = c/n.
