    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the laboratory observer.\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference**\nWe need to consider two inertial frames of reference:\n*   **S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the frame where the observer is at rest. The glass is observed to be moving with a constant velocity `v`.\n*   **S' (Rest Frame of the Glass):** This is the frame moving along with the glass. In this frame, the glass is stationary.\n\n**2. Determine the Speed of Light in the Rest Frame of the Glass (S')**\n*   The definition of the index of refraction `n` is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`).\n*   So, `n = c / u'`.\n*   The problem states that we should take the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`.\n*   Therefore, the speed of light within the glass, as measured in its own rest frame (S'), is `u' = c / n = 1 / n`.\n*   This speed `u'` is in the same direction as the motion of the glass.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n*   We need to find the speed of the light beam `u` as measured in the laboratory frame (S). To do this, we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula, not the classical Galilean addition.\n*   The formula relates the velocity `u` in frame S, the velocity `u'` in frame S', and the relative velocity `v` between the two frames:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n*   The `+` sign is used in the numerator because the light beam (`u'`) and the glass (`v`) are moving in the same direction.\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values into the Formula**\n*   We have `u' = 1/n`.\n*   We have the velocity of the glass `v`.\n*   We are given `c = 1`.\n*   Substituting these into the velocity addition formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n**5. Simplify the Expression**\n*   To simplify the complex fraction, we can find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n*   Numerator: `(1/n) + v = (1 + n*v) / n`\n*   Denominator: `1 + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n*   Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n    `u = ( (1 + n*v) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n*   The `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out.\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Relativity is Key:** This is a problem in special relativity. Using the classical (Galilean) velocity addition (`u = u' + v = 1/n + v`) would give an incorrect answer.\n*   **Frame Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify which speed belongs to which frame of reference. `u'` is the speed in the medium's rest frame, while `u` is the speed in the lab frame.\n*   **Direction:** The problem specifies that the glass and the beam move in the same direction. This determines the signs in the velocity addition formula. If they were moving in opposite directions, `v` would be replaced with `-v`.\n*   **Units:** Setting `c=1` simplifies the algebra, but it's important to remember that the denominator `1 + u'v` is actually `1 + u'v/c^2`.\n\nFinal Answer: The final simplified expression is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n\n<<<D>>>",
