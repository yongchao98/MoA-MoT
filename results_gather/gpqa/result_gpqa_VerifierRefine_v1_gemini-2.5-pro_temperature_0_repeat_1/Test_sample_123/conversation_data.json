    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the required Lorentz factor.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:**\n    The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by exponential decay. The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t` in their own rest frame is given by:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-t/τ)`\n    where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle (a constant for a given particle type).\n\n2.  **Incorporate Special Relativity (Time Dilation):**\n    The particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds relative to the detector (the lab frame). Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime appears longer in the lab frame. The dilated lifetime, `τ'`, is given by:\n    `τ' = γτ`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    The decay law in the lab frame, for a time `t_lab`, becomes:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-t_lab / τ') = e^(-t_lab / (γτ))`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time of Flight in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particles are created at the center and travel to the inner wall of the spherical detector.\n    *   Radius of the detector, `R = 30 m`.\n    *   The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n    *   The time it takes to reach the wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the First Scenario:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall (surviving) = `1/3`.\n    *   Using the decay formula from Step 2:\n        `1/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (γ₁τ))`\n    *   Substitute `γ₁ = 20`:\n        `1/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (20τ))`\n    *   To solve for the unknown term `(R/c)/τ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20τ)`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n        `-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20τ)`\n    *   This gives us a value for the constant term that depends on the particle and detector properties:\n        `(R/c) / τ = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Analyze the Second Scenario:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The desired fraction of particles reaching the wall is `2/3`.\n    *   Set up the decay equation for this scenario:\n        `2/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (γ₂τ))`\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂τ)`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n        `-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂τ)`\n    *   This gives us another expression:\n        `(R/c) / τ = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    We now have two expressions for the same constant `(R/c) / τ`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    Now, isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)))`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Use the standard values for natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931))`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54. This corresponds to option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption that `v ≈ c` is crucial and justified by the problem statement.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The core of the problem is understanding that a higher Lorentz factor leads to greater time dilation, allowing more particles to survive the journey to the detector wall.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of surviving particles is not linear with time or the Lorentz factor.
