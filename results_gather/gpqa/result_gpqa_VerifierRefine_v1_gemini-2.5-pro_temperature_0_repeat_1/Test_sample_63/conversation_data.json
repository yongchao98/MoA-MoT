    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the decomposition products based on the experimental data.**\nThe initial mixture of salts A and B (7.20 g) is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. This gas mixture is then passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution is used to detect acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information, indicating that no CO₂ or other acidic gases (like SO₂, NO₂) were present in the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper acts as a reducing agent and reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, meaning the gas contained oxygen atoms.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The gas that reacted could be O₂, but that would mean 0.025 mol of O₂. Another possibility, common in the decomposition of nitrogen compounds, is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction would be N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. In this case, 0.05 mol of N₂O would provide 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. We will use this information to identify the gas later.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with the drying agent, the alkaline solution, or the hot copper. This suggests it is a relatively inert gas, like nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the gases and deduce the decomposition reactions.**\nLet's verify the identity of the gases by checking the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O (in the oxide) = 0.80 g\n*   The total mass of the initial gas mixture must be 7.20 g. The mass of the gas that became Gas C is 7.20 g - (Mass of H₂O + Mass of O) = 7.20 g - (3.60 g + 0.80 g) = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. This confirms that Gas C is indeed nitrogen (N₂).\n\nNow let's reconsider the reaction in Tube №3. The gas reacting with copper was an oxygen-containing gas. The products of decomposition must contain only N, H, and O, as no other elements are accounted for. The most likely gas is N₂O.\n*   Reaction in Tube №3: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n*   This means that the 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms came from 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n*   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\nThe final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is composed of N₂ produced directly from the initial decomposition and N₂ produced from the reduction of N₂O in Tube №3.\n*   Total N₂ = N₂ (direct) + N₂ (from N₂O)\n*   0.10 mol = N₂ (direct) + 0.05 mol\n*   Therefore, N₂ (direct) = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the initial decomposition of the salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n**Step 3: Identify salts A and B.**\nThe salts must contain N, H, and O. The most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the anions are oxides of nitrogen (NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻). Let's look at their decomposition reactions at ~200°C.\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume we have 'n' moles of each salt.\n*   From n moles of NH₄NO₂, we get n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   From n moles of NH₄NO₃, we get n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nComparing this with our calculated products:\n*   Moles of N₂ = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂O = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\nThese values match perfectly. So, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ (Salt A) and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ (Salt B).\n\n**Step 4: Verify the initial mass.**\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given initial mass.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n*   Salt A: NH₄NO₂\n    *   Atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   Salt B: NH₄NO₃\n    *   Atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>",

A common product from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction would be N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. In this case, 0.05 mol of N₂O would provide 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with the drying agent, the alkaline solution, or the hot copper.

The total mass of the initial gas mixture must be 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   The gas that reacted with copper was N₂O. Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol. Mass of N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g.\n*   The remaining gas C is N₂. Moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol. Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass of gases = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(N₂O) + Mass(N₂) = 3.60 g + 2.20 g + 2.80 g = 8.60 g. This does not match the initial 7.20 g.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the composition of Gas C.\nThe total mass of the initial gas mixture is 7.20 g.\nThe mass of H₂O absorbed is 3.60 g.\nThe mass of O absorbed by Cu is 0.80 g.\nThe mass of the remaining gas C must be the initial mass minus the mass of the components removed:\nMass of Gas C = 7.20 g - (Mass of H₂O + Mass of the gas that reacted with Cu).\nThe gas that reacted with Cu was N₂O. The mass of N₂O is not just the mass of oxygen. Mass N₂O = Moles N₂O * Molar Mass N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44 g/mol = 2.20 g.\nSo, the mass of the gas mixture before Tube 3 was 7.20 g - 3.60 g (H₂O) = 3.60 g.\nThis 3.60 g mixture contained N₂O and the gas that would become Gas C.\nAfter Tube 3, 2.20 g of N₂O reacted, leaving 3.60 g - 2.20 g = 1.40 g of gas.\nThis remaining gas is Gas C. So, Mass of Gas C = 1.40 g.\nWe know Moles of Gas C = 0.10 mol.\nMolar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 1.40 g / 0.10 mol = 14.0 g/mol. This is not a stable molecule.\n\nLet's reconsider the source of Gas C. Gas C is the final gas remaining. It is composed of any inert gas from the initial decomposition PLUS any inert gas formed in the tubes.\n*   Reaction in Tube 3: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n*   We determined that 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted. This reaction produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The final volume of Gas C is 0.10 mol. This final gas is N₂.\n*   Total N₂ (Gas C) = N₂ (from initial decomposition) + N₂ (from N₂O reduction)\n*   0.10 mol = N₂ (from initial decomposition) + 0.05 mol\n*   Therefore, N₂ (from initial decomposition) = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the initial decomposition of the salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n**Step 3: Identify salts A and B.**\nThe salts must contain N, H, and O. The most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the anions are oxides of nitrogen (NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻). Let's look at their decomposition reactions at ~200°C.\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume we have 'n' moles of each salt.\n*   From n moles of NH₄NO₂, we get n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   From n moles of NH₄NO₃, we get n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nComparing this with our calculated products:\n*   Moles of N₂ = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂O = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\nThese values match perfectly. So, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ (Salt A) and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ (Salt B).\n\n**Step 4: Verify the initial mass.**\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.0 + 4(1.0) + 14.0 + 2(16.0) = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.0 + 4(1.0) + 14.0 + 3(16.0) = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given initial mass.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n*   Salt A: NH₄NO₂\n    *   Atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   Salt B: NH₄NO₃\n    *   Atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
