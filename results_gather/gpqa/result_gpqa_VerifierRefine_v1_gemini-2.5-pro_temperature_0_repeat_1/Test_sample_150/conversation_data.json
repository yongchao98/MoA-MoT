    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the given information**\n*   The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (state vector) `|ψ⟩`:\n    ```\n    |ψ⟩ = \n    |-1|\n    | 2|\n    | 1|\n    ```\n*   The observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator `P`:\n    ```\n    P = \n    | 0      1/√2     0   |\n    | 1/√2   0        1/√2|\n    | 0      1/√2     0   |\n    ```\n*   We need to find the probability that a measurement of the observable `P` will yield the value 0.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the theoretical basis**\nIn quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of measuring an observable are the eigenvalues of its corresponding operator. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue `λ` for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|^2 / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\nwhere `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must first find the eigenvector of `P` that corresponds to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the eigenvalues of the operator P**\nTo confirm that 0 is a possible measurement outcome, we find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n```\ndet | -λ     1/√2     0    |\n    | 1/√2   -λ       1/√2 | = 0\n    | 0      1/√2     -λ   |\n```\nExpanding the determinant:\n`(-λ) * ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2) * ((1/√2)(-λ) - 0) + 0 = 0`\n`-λ * (λ^2 - 1/2) - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = 0`\n`-λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n`-λ^3 + λ = 0`\n`λ(1 - λ^2) = 0`\n`λ(1 - λ)(1 + λ) = 0`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`. Since 0 is one of the eigenvalues, it is a possible result of the measurement.\n\n**Step 4: Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0**\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|v_0⟩` that satisfies the equation `P|v_0⟩ = 0 * |v_0⟩`, which simplifies to `P|v_0⟩ = 0`. Let the eigenvector be `|v_0⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n```\n| 0      1/√2     0   | |x|   |0|\n| 1/√2   0        1/√2| |y| = |0|\n| 0      1/√2     0   | |z|   |0|\n```\nThis gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n3.  `(1/√2) * y = 0` (This is the same as the first equation)\n\nFrom these equations, we know `y=0` and `x=-z`. We can choose a simple non-zero value for one of the variables, for instance, let `z = -1`, which makes `x = 1`.\nSo, an unnormalized eigenvector `|v_0⟩` for the eigenvalue `λ = 0` is:\n```\n|v_0⟩ = \n| 1|\n| 0|\n|-1|\n```\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the probability**\nNow we use the probability formula: `Prob(λ=0) = |⟨v_0|ψ⟩|^2 / (⟨v_0|v_0⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`.\n\n*   **Calculate the inner product `⟨v_0|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨v_0|` is the transpose conjugate of `|v_0⟩`, which is the row vector `[1, 0, -1]`.\n    `⟨v_0|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] * |-1| = (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2`\n    So, `|⟨v_0|ψ⟩|^2 = (-2)^2 = 4`.\n\n*   **Calculate the norm squared of the eigenvector, `⟨v_0|v_0⟩`:**\n    `⟨v_0|v_0⟩ = [1, 0, -1] * | 1| = (1)*(1) + (0)*(0) + (-1)*(-1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`\n    `                         | 0|`\n    `                         |-1|`\n\n*   **Calculate the norm squared of the state vector, `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1] * |-1| = (-1)*(-1) + (2)*(2) + (1)*(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n    `                      | 2|`\n    `                      | 1|`\n\n*   **Compute the final probability:**\n    `Prob(λ=0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable `P` will yield the value 0 is 1/3. This corresponds to option A.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  The state vector `|ψ⟩` and the eigenvector `|v_0⟩` do not need to be normalized beforehand if you use the full probability formula `|⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|^2 / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`. Normalizing them is an alternative approach that leads to the same result.\n2.  Ensure you are finding the eigenvector for the correct eigenvalue (in this case, `λ=0`).\n3.  The inner product `⟨a|b⟩` involves the conjugate transpose of `|a⟩`. Since all numbers here are real, it is simply the transpose.\n4.  The probability is the *magnitude squared* of the projection, so `|⟨v_0|ψ⟩|^2`, not just `⟨v_0|ψ⟩`.\n\n<<<A>>>",
