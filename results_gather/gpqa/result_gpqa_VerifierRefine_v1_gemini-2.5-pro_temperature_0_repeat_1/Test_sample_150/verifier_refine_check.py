    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem involves:
    - State vector |ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T
    - Observable operator P
    - Finding the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0.

    The verification process follows these steps:
    1. Define the state vector and the operator matrix using NumPy.
    2. Verify that 0 is a valid eigenvalue of the operator P.
    3. Verify that the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 used in the solution, |v_0⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T, is correct by checking if P|v_0⟩ = 0.
    4. Recalculate the probability using the formula: Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|^2 / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩).
    5. Compare the calculated probability with the given answer (1/3).
