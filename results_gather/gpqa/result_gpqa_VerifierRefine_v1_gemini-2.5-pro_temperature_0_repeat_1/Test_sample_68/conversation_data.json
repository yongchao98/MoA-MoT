    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe a certain fraction of particle decays. \"Resolution\" in this context refers to the minimum track length of the particle $X^0$ that a detector can measure before it decays. If the particle decays after traveling a distance greater than this resolution ($d_{res}$), the decay is considered \"observed\". We need to find the value of $d_{res}$ such that at least 30% of the decays are observed.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Physics Condition:**\n    *   The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives for a time $t$ in a given reference frame is $P(t) = e^{-t/\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the mean lifetime in that frame.\n    *   The distance the particle travels is $d = v \\cdot t$, where $v$ is its velocity. The mean decay length in the lab frame is $L_{lab} = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n    *   The probability of a particle traveling a distance $d$ before decaying is equivalent to the probability of it surviving for a time $t = d/v$. This probability is $P(\\text{distance} > d) = e^{-(d/v)/\\tau_{lab}} = e^{-d/L_{lab}}$.\n    *   We are given that we need to observe \"at least 30% of the decays\". This means the probability of the decay length being greater than the resolution ($d_{res}$) must be at least 0.30.\n    *   $P(\\text{distance} > d_{res}) \\ge 0.30 \\implies e^{-d_{res}/L_{lab}} \\ge 0.30$.\n    *   The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". This is slightly ambiguous wording. A better resolution is a smaller distance. The condition $e^{-d_{res}/L_{lab}} \\ge 0.30$ sets an upper limit on the resolution: $d_{res} \\le -L_{lab} \\ln(0.3)$. The question is asking for this threshold value. So we will calculate $d = -L_{lab} \\ln(0.3)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor relates the energy and rest mass of a particle: $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n    *   Given: Total energy $E = 27$ GeV and rest mass energy $m_0 c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length in the Lab Frame ($L_{lab}$):**\n    *   The mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is dilated by the Lorentz factor: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   The mean decay length in the lab frame is $L_{lab} = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = v \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   A more direct formula relates the decay length to momentum ($p$): $L_{lab} = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0$.\n    *   First, find the momentum using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$.\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.784$ GeV.\n    *   Now calculate $L_{lab}$:\n        $L_{lab} = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\n        $L_{lab} = \\frac{26.784 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n        $L_{lab} \\approx 7.8545 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m})$\n        $L_{lab} \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Resolution ($d_{res}$):**\n    *   From Step 2, we need to calculate $d_{res} = -L_{lab} \\ln(0.3)$.\n    *   $\\ln(0.3) \\approx -1.204$.\n    *   $d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options and Refine:**\n    *   Our calculated value is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    *   The given options are:\n        A) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n        B) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n        C) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n        D) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    *   Option C is the only one with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$ m), but our value differs by about 9%. This suggests a possible typo in the question's numbers.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that \"30%\" was a typo for \"one-third\" (33.3...%), as this is a common simplification.\n    *   If the required survival probability is $1/3$, then the resolution would be:\n        $d_{res} = -L_{lab} \\ln(1/3) = L_{lab} \\ln(3)$.\n    *   $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$.\n    *   $d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    *   This value, $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The minor difference can be attributed to rounding in the problem's given constants.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculation based on the interpretation that \"30%\" was a typo for \"1/3\" yields a result that matches one of the options almost perfectly. Therefore, we select the corresponding option.\n\n*   **Mean decay length in lab frame, $L_{lab}$:** $1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n*   **Required resolution, $d_{res}$:** $d_{res} = L_{lab} \\times \\ln(3) \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n*   **Closest Option:** C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n<<<C>>>",
