    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concept:** The problem describes a scenario where an object (the spacecraft) is traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light. This immediately points to the principles of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, specifically **time dilation**. Time dilation is the phenomenon where time passes at a different rate for a moving observer compared to a stationary observer. The time experienced by the moving observer (the astronaut) is called the \"proper time\" (Δt₀), and it is shorter than the time measured by a stationary observer (e.g., on Earth), which is the \"dilated time\" (Δt).\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Speed of the spacecraft (v): 0.99999987 * c\n    *   Astronaut's starting age: 22 years\n    *   Average lifespan of the aliens: 150 years\n    *   Destination: Earth\n    *   Origin: Large Magellanic Cloud\n\n3.  **Identify Necessary but Missing Information:** The problem does not state the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to Earth. This is a crucial piece of information that we must find from astronomical data. The accepted distance to the LMC is approximately **159,000 light-years**. We will use this value for our calculation. This distance is the \"proper distance\" (L₀) as measured in the stationary reference frame of the Earth and the LMC.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor quantifies the extent of time dilation and length contraction. It is calculated using the formula:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n    *   First, find v/c: v/c = 0.99999987\n    *   Next, calculate 1 - (v/c)²:\n        1 - (0.99999987)²\n        We can use the algebraic identity a² - b² = (a-b)(a+b) to simplify this:\n        1 - (0.99999987)² = (1 - 0.99999987) * (1 + 0.99999987)\n        = (0.00000013) * (1.99999987)\n        ≈ 0.00000026 = 2.6 x 10⁻⁷\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        γ = 1 / √(2.6 x 10⁻⁷)\n        γ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\n        γ ≈ 1961.16\n\n5.  **Calculate the Journey Time from Earth's Perspective (Δt):** For an observer on Earth, the time it takes for the spacecraft to arrive is the distance divided by the speed.\n    *   Distance (L₀) = 159,000 light-years\n    *   Speed (v) = 0.99999987 * c\n    *   Δt = L₀ / v = (159,000 light-years) / (0.99999987 * c)\n    *   Since 1 light-year = c * 1 year, we can write:\n        Δt = (159,000 * c * years) / (0.99999987 * c)\n    *   The 'c' terms cancel out:\n        Δt = 159,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 159,000.02 years.\n    *   So, from Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 159,000 years.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Journey Time from the Astronaut's Perspective (Δt₀):** This is the time the astronaut actually experiences. We use the time dilation formula:\n    Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    Rearranging to solve for the astronaut's time:\n    Δt₀ = Δt / γ\n    *   Δt₀ = 159,000.02 years / 1961.16\n    *   Δt₀ ≈ 81.07 years\n\n7.  **Final Check and Conclusion:**\n    *   The time elapsed for the astronaut during the journey is approximately **81 years**.\n    *   The astronaut's age upon arrival would be their starting age plus the journey time: 22 + 81 = 103 years.\n    *   Since the average lifespan is 150 years, the astronaut (at 103 years old) would survive the trip. This rules out option B.\n    *   The calculated time of ~81 years matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Reference Frames:** It is critical to distinguish between the astronaut's moving reference frame (where proper time Δt₀ is measured) and the Earth's stationary reference frame (where dilated time Δt and proper distance L₀ are measured).\n*   **External Data:** The solution depends on knowing the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Since multiple-choice answers are provided, we can infer that the problem was designed around a specific, standard value for this distance (~159,000 light-years).\n*   **Lorentz Factor Calculation:** The value of (v/c) is very close to 1. This makes the term `1 - (v/c)²` very small and sensitive to rounding. Using the algebraic simplification `(1-x)(1+x)` helps maintain precision.\n*   **Lifespan Check:** The information about the astronaut's age and lifespan is included to ensure the scenario is plausible and to check against the possibility that the journey, even with time dilation, is too long for the astronaut to survive.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the conclusion that the journey will take approximately 81 years from the astronaut's point of view.\n\n<<<C>>>",
