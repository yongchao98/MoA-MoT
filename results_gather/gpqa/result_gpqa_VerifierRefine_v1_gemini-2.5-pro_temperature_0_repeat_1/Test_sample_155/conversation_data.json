    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        Pr      H\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n        H      Pr\n        (where Pr = propyl, -CH2CH2CH3)\n    ```\n2.  **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process that results in anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   First, mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) is an epoxidizing agent. The addition of the oxygen atom is a *syn*-addition. Treating a *trans*-alkene with mCPBA results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation can occur from either the top or bottom face with equal probability, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Second, aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) is added. This catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-opening of the epoxide ring.\n\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:** The overall transformation is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. There is a well-established stereochemical rule for this type of reaction:\n    *   **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**\n    Let's confirm this by considering the intermediates. The racemic mixture of trans-epoxides reacts with water. Let's consider one enantiomer, say (4R,5R)-epoxide. The anti-attack of water at C4 (inverting its configuration to S) results in the (4S,5R)-diol. The anti-attack of water at C5 (inverting its configuration to S) also results in the (4R,5S)-diol. Both (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) describe the same *meso* compound. The same meso product is obtained from the other epoxide enantiomer.\n    Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        Pr      Pr\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n        H      H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagents:** The reaction is the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence.\n    *   First, mCPBA performs a *syn*-addition of oxygen. Treating a *cis*-alkene with mCPBA results in a *cis*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric and achiral, the product is a single, achiral *meso* compound: meso-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Second, aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) causes an *anti*-opening of the epoxide ring.\n\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:** The overall transformation is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene. The stereochemical rule is:\n    *   **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture**\n    Let's confirm this. The meso-epoxide is attacked by water. Since the epoxide is symmetric, attack at C4 and C5 are equally probable. Anti-attack at C4 leads to the (4R,5R)-diol, while anti-attack at C5 leads to the (4S,5S)-diol. These two products are enantiomers. Since the starting materials are achiral, the two enantiomeric products must be formed in equal amounts.\n    Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and therefore will have different retention times and will be separated into distinct peaks.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to differentiate between enantiomers by forming transient diastereomeric interactions of different stabilities.\n    *   A chiral column can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n    *   All three compounds in the mixture—the meso-diol, the (4R,5R)-diol, and the (4S,5S)-diol—will have different interactions with the chiral stationary phase and thus different retention times.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The reaction sequence (mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺) corresponds to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   Remember the stereochemical rules for addition reactions to alkenes:\n    *   Cis + Anti → Racemic\n    *   Trans + Anti → Meso\n    *   Cis + Syn → Meso\n    *   Trans + Syn → Racemic\n*   Understand the separation principles of achiral vs. chiral chromatography:\n    *   Achiral columns separate diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n    *   Chiral columns separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   A meso compound is achiral but has chiral centers. It is a diastereomer to any chiral stereoisomers.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n- Reaction 1 ((E)-alkene) yields one product: the meso-diol.\n- Reaction 2 ((Z)-alkene) yields two products: a racemic mixture of enantiomeric diols.\n- The combined mixture has three compounds total: one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers.\n- Standard HPLC sees two species (the meso compound and the unresolved enantiomeric pair).\n- Chiral HPLC sees three species (the meso compound and the two resolved enantiomers).\n\n<<<C>>>",

This is an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening. This sequence results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the double bond.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical rule for this type of reaction is: **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**.\n    *   The first step, epoxidation with mCPBA, is a *syn*-addition, which converts the *trans*-alkene into a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The second step, acid-catalyzed ring opening with water, is an Sₙ2-like attack that proceeds with inversion of configuration (*anti*-opening).\n    *   Opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.

The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved enantiomeric pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers.\n    *   It separates all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n    *   The meso-diol, the (4R,5R)-diol, and the (4S,5S)-diol are all stereochemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
