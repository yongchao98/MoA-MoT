def check_decay_probability():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the given answer to the radioactive decay problem.

    The problem states:
    - Decay probability in 100 minutes is 32% (P_decay(100) = 0.32).
    - The atom has survived for 50 minutes.
    - Question: What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

    The solution relies on the memoryless property of exponential decay.
    The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the past 50 minutes
    and is equal to the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.

    The decay formula is P_decay(t) = 1 - exp(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.
    The survival formula is P_survive(t) = exp(-λt).

    1. From the given data, we find a relationship for λ:
       P_decay(100) = 0.32
       1 - exp(-λ * 100) = 0.32
       exp(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

    2. We need to calculate P_decay(150):
       P_decay(150) = 1 - exp(-λ * 150)

    3. We can find exp(-λ * 150) from exp(-λ * 100):
       exp(-λ * 150) = exp(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-λ * 100))^1.5
       exp(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5

    4. Calculate the final probability and compare with the given answer (44%).
