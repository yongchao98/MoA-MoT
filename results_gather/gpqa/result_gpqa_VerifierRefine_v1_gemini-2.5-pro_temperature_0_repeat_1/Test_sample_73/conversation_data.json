    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay:**\n    Radioactive decay is a random, quantum process. For any single unstable nucleus, the probability of it decaying in the next second is constant, regardless of how long it has already existed. This is known as the **memoryless property**. This means the fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes has no bearing on its probability of decaying in the future. The \"clock\" effectively resets at the 50-minute mark.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mathematical Model:**\n    The probability of a single atom *surviving* (not decaying) for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n    Consequently, the probability of the atom *decaying* within a time `t` is:\n    `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Data to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n    Using our formula:\n    `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    Rearranging the equation to find the survival probability:\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n    This equation relates the decay constant `λ` to the known experimental data. We don't need to calculate the exact value of `λ`; we can use this relationship directly.\n\n4.  **Define the Question Mathematically:**\n    We are asked for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   Let A be the event \"the atom decays in the next 150 minutes\" (i.e., between t=50 and t=200).\n    *   Let B be the event \"the atom has not decayed by t=50\".\n    We want to find the conditional probability P(A|B).\n\n5.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    Because of the memoryless nature of radioactive decay, the condition that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay. Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n    So, we just need to calculate `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    We need to find the value of `e^(-150λ)`. We can use the relationship we found in Step 3: `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    Using the rules of exponents:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Now, substitute the known value:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    Let's calculate this value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * (0.68)^0.5 = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68)`\n    `sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246`\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n    This is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes.\n\n    The probability of it *decaying* in 150 minutes is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This is closest to the option 44%.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Memoryless Property is Key:** The most common mistake is to think that since some time has passed, the decay is \"overdue.\" For radioactive decay, this is incorrect. The probability per unit time is constant.\n*   **Exponential vs. Linear:** Decay probability is not linear. You cannot say that if it's 32% in 100 minutes, it's 16% in 50 minutes.\n*   **Working with Exponents:** It is more accurate to manipulate the exponential terms (like `e^(-100λ)`) rather than solving for `λ` first, as this avoids rounding errors.\n*   **Conditional Probability:** The formal way to solve this is using the conditional probability formula `P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)`. This approach also leads to `1 - e^(-150λ)`, confirming that the memoryless property shortcut is valid.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>",

This is closest to option A, 44%.\n\n### Formal Conditional Probability (Optional Confirmation)\nThe probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200, given survival up to t=50 is:\n`P(decay in [50, 200] | survive up to 50) = P(decay in [50, 200] AND survive up to 50) / P(survive up to 50)`\nThe event \"decay in [50, 200] AND survive up to 50\" is the same as \"survive up to 50 and then decay before 200\". This is `P(survive up to 50) - P(survive up to 200)`.\nSo, the probability is `(P_survive(50) - P_survive(200)) / P_survive(50)`\n`= (e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)) / e^(-50λ)`\n`= 1 - e^(-200λ) / e^(-50λ)`\n`= 1 - e^(-200λ + 50λ)`\n`= 1 - e^(-150λ)`\nThis confirms that the result is simply the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, as deduced from the memoryless property.\n\n<<<A>>>"
