    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Given Information:**\n    *   **Star:** Radius $R_s = 1.5 R_{sun}$.\n    *   **Planet 1 (P1):**\n        *   Radius $R_{p1} = 1 R_{earth}$.\n        *   Orbital Period $P_1 = 3$ days.\n        *   Transit Impact Parameter $b_1 = 0.2$.\n        *   Orbit is circular.\n    *   **Planet 2 (P2):**\n        *   Radius $R_{p2} = 2.5 R_{earth}$.\n        *   Orbit is circular.\n        *   Shares the same orbital plane as P1.\n    *   **Objective:** Find the maximum orbital period ($P_2$) for Planet 2 to exhibit both transit and occultation events.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Conditions for Transit and Occultation:**\n    *   A **transit** occurs when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view.\n    *   An **occultation** (or secondary eclipse) is when the planet passes behind the star.\n    *   For a planet in a circular orbit, if a transit occurs, an occultation will naturally occur half an orbit later. Therefore, the problem boils down to finding the maximum orbital period for which a transit is still possible.\n    *   The maximum orbital period corresponds to the largest possible orbital distance (semi-major axis, *a*) that still allows for a transit. This limiting case is a \"grazing transit,\" where the planet's path just skims the edge of the star.\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Geometry to Orbital Parameters:**\n    *   The **impact parameter (b)** is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at mid-transit, measured in units of the star's radius. It is given by the formula:\n        $b = \\frac{a \\cos(i)}{R_s}$\n        where *a* is the semi-major axis and *i* is the orbital inclination (the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky; i=90° for an edge-on orbit).\n    *   Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, they share the same inclination *i*. The star's radius $R_s$ is also the same for both. This means the term $\\frac{\\cos(i)}{R_s}$ is a constant for the system.\n\n4.  **Determine the Maximum Impact Parameter for Planet 2:**\n    *   A transit occurs as long as some part of the planet's disk crosses the star's disk. The absolute limit is when the edge of the planet grazes the edge of the star.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (The Precise Condition):** The center-to-center projected distance at this limit is $R_s + R_{p2}$. The maximum impact parameter is therefore $b_{2,max} = \\frac{R_s + R_{p2}}{R_s} = 1 + \\frac{R_{p2}}{R_s}$.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (The Common Approximation):** In many astronomical problems, the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's radius ($R_p \\ll R_s$). In such cases, it's common to approximate the condition for a transit as the planet's center simply needing to pass over the stellar disk. This simplifies the maximum impact parameter to $b_{2,max} \\approx 1$. We will proceed with this approximation, as it is standard for this type of problem and leads directly to one of the answers.\n\n5.  **Relate the Orbits of the Two Planets:**\n    *   For Planet 1: $b_1 = \\frac{a_1 \\cos(i)}{R_s} = 0.2$\n    *   For Planet 2 (at its maximum orbit): $b_{2,max} = \\frac{a_2 \\cos(i)}{R_s} \\approx 1$\n    *   By dividing the second equation by the first, we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n        $\\frac{b_{2,max}}{b_1} = \\frac{a_2 \\cos(i) / R_s}{a_1 \\cos(i) / R_s} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$\n    *   Substituting the values:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5$\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law to Find the Period:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($P^2 \\propto a^3$).\n    *   This can be written as a ratio: $\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^3$\n    *   Solving for $P_2$: $P_2 = P_1 \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{3/2}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Substitute the known values of $P_1$ and the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n        $P_2 \\approx 3 \\text{ days} \\times (5)^{3/2}$\n    *   Calculate the value of $(5)^{3/2}$:\n        $(5)^{3/2} = 5^{1.5} = 5 \\times \\sqrt{5} \\approx 5 \\times 2.236 = 11.18$\n    *   Now, calculate $P_2$:\n        $P_2 \\approx 3 \\times 11.18 = 33.54$ days\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated maximum period for Planet 2 is approximately 33.5 days. This matches option D.
