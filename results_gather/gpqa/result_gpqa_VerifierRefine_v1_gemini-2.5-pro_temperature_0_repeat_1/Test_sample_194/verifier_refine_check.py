    # The condition for a transit to occur is that the impact parameter b must be less than
    # a maximum value. The maximum orbital period corresponds to the maximum semi-major axis,
    # which in turn corresponds to the maximum impact parameter for a transit (a grazing transit).

    # The LLM correctly uses the common approximation that for a transit to occur, the planet's
    # center must pass in front of the star's disk. This sets the maximum impact parameter
    # b2_max to 1 (in units of stellar radii). The planet's own radius is considered negligible.
    b2_max = 1.0

    # The provided radii of the star and planets are not needed for this calculation,
    # as the LLM correctly points out. This is a common feature in problems designed
    # to test understanding of ratios and approximations.

    # --- Step 1: Find the ratio of the semi-major axes ---
    # The impact parameter b is given by b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s.
    # Since both planets are in the same system and orbital plane, cos(i) and R_s are constant.
    # Therefore, the ratio of semi-major axes is equal to the ratio of impact parameters:
