    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the minimum volume of acid and the resulting pH.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe main goal is to dissolve 0.1 g of solid Fe(OH)₃ in a final volume of 100 cm³ by adding a 0.1 M strong acid. We need to find the minimum volume of acid required and the pH of the final solution. \"Minimum volume\" implies that we add just enough acid to make the solution saturated with respect to Fe(OH)₃, meaning the dissolution equilibrium is just met.\n\n**2. Write Down the Chemical Reactions**\nThere are two key processes happening:\n*   **Dissolution/Neutralization:** The solid iron(III) hydroxide reacts with the strong acid (H⁺).\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Solubility Equilibrium:** For the solid to be fully dissolved, the ion product (Q) must be less than or equal to the solubility product constant (Ksp). The \"minimum\" condition corresponds to the point of saturation, where Q = Ksp.\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\n**3. Calculate Moles and Initial Concentrations**\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    M(Fe(OH)₃) = M(Fe) + 3 × M(O) + 3 × M(H)\n    M(Fe(OH)₃) = 55.85 + 3 × 16.00 + 3 × 1.01 = 106.88 g/mol\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    n(Fe(OH)₃) = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol\n*   **Concentration of Fe³⁺ in the final solution:**\n    The final volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    [Fe³⁺] = n(Fe(OH)₃) / V_total = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M\n\n**4. Determine the Total Acid Needed**\nThe total amount of acid added (H⁺) is used for two purposes:\n1.  **Reacting with Fe(OH)₃:** This is the stoichiometric amount needed for the neutralization reaction.\n2.  **Remaining in solution:** An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final solution to keep the pH low enough to prevent Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating.\n\nLet's calculate these two parts.\n\n*   **Part 1: H⁺ for Reaction**\n    From the stoichiometry Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    n(H⁺)_react = 3 × n(Fe(OH)₃) = 3 × 0.0009356 mol = 0.002807 mol\n\n*   **Part 2: H⁺ Remaining in Solution**\n    The amount of H⁺ remaining determines the final pH. This final pH must be low enough to satisfy the Ksp condition. Since we don't know the Ksp value used for this problem, the most reliable method is to test the given options to see which one is internally consistent.\n\n**5. Test the Options**\nLet's test Option C, as it is a plausible choice.\n**Assumption: The final solution has pH = 2.69 and was made with V = 30.09 cm³ of acid.**\n\n*   **Calculate H⁺ remaining based on the pH:**\n    If pH = 2.69, then the final concentration of H⁺ is:\n    [H⁺]_final = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M\n    The moles of H⁺ remaining in the 0.1 L final volume are:\n    n(H⁺)_final = [H⁺]_final × V_total = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol\n\n*   **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ that must have been added:**\n    n(H⁺)_total = n(H⁺)_react + n(H⁺)_final\n    n(H⁺)_total = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = 0.0030112 mol\n\n*   **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid this corresponds to:**\n    V_acid = n(H⁺)_total / Concentration_acid\n    V_acid = 0.0030112 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L\n    Converting to cm³: V_acid = 0.030112 L × 1000 cm³/L = 30.11 cm³\n\n*   **Compare with the value in Option C:**\n    The calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is extremely close to the volume given in Option C (30.09 cm³). The minor difference is due to rounding of atomic masses and constants. This strong agreement indicates that Option C is the correct, internally consistent answer.\n\n**6. Final Check (Optional but good practice)**\nWe can check if the other options are consistent. For example, testing Option B (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³):\n*   n(H⁺)_final for pH 2.04 = (10⁻².⁰⁴ M) * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol\n*   n(H⁺)_total = 0.002807 mol + 0.000912 mol = 0.003719 mol\n*   V_acid = 0.003719 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³.\n*   This calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume in Option B (28.05 cm³). Therefore, Option B is incorrect. The same inconsistency is found for options A and D.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only pair of values for pH and volume that is consistent with the chemical principles governing the dissolution is Option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
