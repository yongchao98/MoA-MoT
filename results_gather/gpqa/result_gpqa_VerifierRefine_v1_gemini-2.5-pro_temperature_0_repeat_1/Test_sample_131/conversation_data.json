    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals, both singlets, around 6.7 ppm. The integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** Three signals, all singlets, around 2.2 ppm. The integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the molecular formula of the options**\n\nLet's check if all the given compounds match the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4):** 6 carbons in the ring + 4 methyl carbons = 10 carbons. 2 hydrogens on the ring + (4 * 3) hydrogens in methyl groups = 14 hydrogens. The formula is C10H14. This applies to 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(CH2CH3)2):** 6 carbons in the ring + (2 * 2) carbons in ethyl groups = 10 carbons. 4 hydrogens on the ring + (2 * 5) hydrogens in ethyl groups = 14 hydrogens. The formula is C10H14.\nAll four options are isomers with the correct molecular formula.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integration.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (no adjacent protons) with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This will result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This will result in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to 1:1.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent, producing **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be split by the CH3 protons, and vice-versa.\n        1.  A **quartet** for the CH2 groups (4H).\n        2.  A **triplet** for the CH3 groups (6H).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The problem states that all signals in the alkyl region are singlets. Since 1,4-diethylbenzene shows a quartet and a triplet, any option containing it (Option A) can be immediately eliminated.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers that matches the given spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers show one aromatic singlet for 2H. A 1:1 mixture of any two of them will have two different types of aromatic protons, each contributing 2H. This will result in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio (2H:2H). This part of the data is consistent with any pair of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Analysis (The Deciding Factor):**\n    *   The mixture has three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl (methyl) protons is 12H (from the first compound) + 12H (from the second compound) = 24H.\n    *   Let's find the absolute integration of the signals. If the ratio is 2:1:1, the total integration can be represented as 2x + 1x + 1x = 4x.\n    *   Since 4x = 24H, then x = 6H.\n    *   Therefore, the three singlets in the mixture must have integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n**Step 5: Test the remaining combinations**\n\nWe need to find a pair of compounds whose individual alkyl signals combine to give three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   Prehnitene signals: one 6H singlet, another 6H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene signals: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, another 3H singlet.\n    *   Combined: We would have signals of (6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This cannot be combined to form signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   Durene signal: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene signals: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, another 3H singlet.\n    *   Combined: We would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observation of three signals unless two signals accidentally overlap. If the two 3H signals from isodurene overlap, we would get signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. While possible, this requires an assumption of accidental degeneracy.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   Durene signal: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   Prehnitene signals: **one 6H singlet** and **another 6H singlet**.\n    *   Combined: This combination directly gives **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches all the data provided in the problem without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
