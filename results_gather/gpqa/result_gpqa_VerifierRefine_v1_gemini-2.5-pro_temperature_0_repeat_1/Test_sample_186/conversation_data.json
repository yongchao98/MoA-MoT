    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of detectable stars.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the detection threshold for ESPRESSO**\n\nThe problem defines a star as \"detectable\" if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved in a 1-hour exposure using a single 8m VLT telescope. We need to find the faintest apparent magnitude (V) that meets this criterion.\n\n1.  **Consult the ESPRESSO documentation:** The provided link leads to the ESPRESSO overview page. We look for the performance table, specifically the \"ESPRESSO expected S/N per binned pixel (1x2 binning) in 1-UT mode\" table. \"1-UT mode\" means using one VLT Unit Telescope.\n2.  **Find the relevant data:** We look at the row for a 3600s (1-hour) exposure.\n    *   For a star with V = 16 mag, the S/N is 16.\n    *   For a star with V = 17 mag, the S/N is 10.\n    *   For a star with V = 18 mag, the S/N is 6.\n3.  **Establish the limiting magnitude:** An S/N of at least 10 is achieved for stars with an apparent magnitude of V = 17 or brighter. Therefore, the detection condition is **V ≤ 17**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each star individually**\n\nFor each star, we must determine two things:\n1.  Is it visible from the Paranal Observatory?\n2.  If visible, is its apparent V magnitude ≤ 17?\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6° (Southern Hemisphere). A celestial object is not observable if it never rises above the horizon. For an observer in the Southern Hemisphere, stars with a high positive declination (far northern stars) may always be below the horizon. Polaris is a prime example.\n\n---\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52°. As a prominent southern star, it is easily visible from Paranal in the Southern Hemisphere.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent V magnitude of approximately **-0.74**.\n*   **Detection:** Since -0.74 ≤ 17, **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of approximately +89°. From Paranal's southern latitude of -24.6°, Polaris is permanently below the horizon and thus cannot be observed.\n*   **Detection:** Since it is not visible from the observatory, **Polaris is not detectable.**\n\n**c) Star with Mv = 15 at d = 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The star has a declination of 0° (on the celestial equator). The celestial equator is visible from all locations on Earth, including Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (mv):** We use the distance modulus formula: `mv = Mv + 5 * log10(d) - 5`, where `Mv` is the absolute magnitude and `d` is the distance in parsecs.\n    *   `mv = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5`\n    *   `mv = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5`\n    *   `mv = 15`\n*   **Detection:** Since 15 ≤ 17, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with Mv = 15 at d = 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (mv):**\n    *   `mv = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5`\n    *   `log10(200) ≈ 2.30`\n    *   `mv ≈ 15 + 5 * 2.30 - 5`\n    *   `mv ≈ 15 + 11.5 - 5`\n    *   `mv ≈ 21.5`\n*   **Detection:** Since 21.5 > 17, **this star is not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with Mv = 15 at d = 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (mv):**\n    *   `mv = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5`\n    *   `log10(5) ≈ 0.70`\n    *   `mv ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.70 - 5`\n    *   `mv ≈ 15 + 3.5 - 5`\n    *   `mv ≈ 13.5`\n*   **Detection:** Since 13.5 ≤ 17, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with Mv = 15 at d = 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (mv):**\n    *   `mv = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5`\n    *   `log10(50) ≈ 1.70`\n    *   `mv ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.70 - 5`\n    *   `mv ≈ 15 + 8.5 - 5`\n    *   `mv ≈ 18.5`\n*   **Detection:** Since 18.5 > 17, **this star is not detectable.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Count the detectable stars**\n\nLet's summarize the results:\n*   a) Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   b) Polaris: **Not Detectable** (not visible)\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Detectable** (V = 15)\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: **Not Detectable** (V ≈ 21.5)\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Detectable** (V ≈ 13.5)\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: **Not Detectable** (V ≈ 18.5)\n\nThe total number of detectable stars is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>",
