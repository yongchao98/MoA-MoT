    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial state after dilution.**\nFirst, we need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Volume of water added: 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume of the solution (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂).\n    *   M₂ = (M₁ × V₁) / V₂\n    *   M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n*   **Careful Point:** The concentration of the acetic acid solution we are titrating is 0.025 M, not 0.05 M. The initial volume of the acid solution is 40.00 cm³.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles of conjugate base to the moles of weak acid is 25% to (100% - 25%) = 75%.\n    *   Ratio [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25 / 75 = 1/3\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([conjugate base] / [weak acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.253\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Recognize that the 25% titration point is in the buffer region and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the appropriate tool. The ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of moles.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, and the solution contains only the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   **First, find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\n    *   Moles of acid = M_acid × V_acid = 0.025 M × 0.04000 L = 0.001 moles\n    *   At equivalence, moles of base = moles of acid = 0.001 moles.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = moles / M_base = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Next, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point.**\n    *   Total volume = Initial acid volume + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n    *   Moles of acetate formed = initial moles of acid = 0.001 moles\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = moles / total volume = 0.001 moles / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Now, calculate the pH of the 0.02 M acetate solution.** The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   We set up an ICE table to find the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻].\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   So, [OH⁻] = x = 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Finally, calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n*   **Careful Point:** At the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. You must calculate the concentration of this base using the total volume of the solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pH at 25% titration is 4.26.\nThe pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
