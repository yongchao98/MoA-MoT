    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of compound E and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction clues to identify the compounds.**\n\n*   **Clue 4: D + B → H (1:1 ratio), H is used as a solvent.**\n    This is a reaction between two gases (B and D) to form a liquid solvent (H). A well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) from sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and chlorine (Cl₂), which is often used as a non-polar solvent.\n    SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l)\n    This suggests:\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (or SO₂)\n    *   **D = SO₂** (or Cl₂)\n    *   **H = SO₂Cl₂**\n\n*   **Clue 3: C + H₂O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.**\n    This is a hydrolysis reaction where compound C reacts with water to regenerate solid A and form two acids, one strong and one weak. This strongly suggests that C is a halide of a non-metal or metalloid.\n    Let's use our identification of B = Cl₂. This means C is a chloride of element A. The hydrolysis of a non-metal chloride typically produces HCl (a strong acid) and an oxoacid of the non-metal (often a weak acid).\n    *   **F = HCl** (strong acid).\n    *   This implies A is a non-metal/metalloid that forms a weak oxoacid G.\n    Let's test some possibilities for A:\n    *   If A = P (Phosphorus), C would be PCl₅. Hydrolysis: PCl₅ + 4H₂O → 5HCl (strong) + H₃PO₄ (weak). This is a perfect fit for the products.\n    *   If A = S (Sulfur), C could be SCl₂ or S₂Cl₂. Hydrolysis: 2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → 4HCl (strong) + S + SO₂ (which forms weak H₂SO₃ in water). This also fits.\n    *   If A = I₂ (Iodine), C would be a chloride of iodine, like ICl. Hydrolysis of ICl is complex, but one possible reaction is 5ICl + 3H₂O → 5HCl (strong) + HIO₃ (iodic acid, weaker than HCl) + 2I₂ (regenerating A). This is also a very good fit.\n\n*   **Clue 1: Solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.**\n    This clue helps us distinguish between the possibilities for A and C.\n    *   If C = PCl₅, it is a pale greenish-yellow solid, not bright red. This contradicts the clue.\n    *   If C = SCl₂, it is a cherry-red liquid. The problem states \"product C\", not \"solid C\", so this is possible.\n    *   If C = ICl, it is a red-brown solid. This fits the description \"bright red product\" well.\n    Let's proceed with the most promising candidate: **C = ICl**. This implies **A = I₂**.\n    The reaction is I₂(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2ICl(s).\n    The stoichiometry is 1:1, not 1:8. The number \"8\" in the problem is likely a typo or a red herring, as it doesn't fit any simple chemical reaction. The qualitative descriptions (color, states, reaction types) are more reliable.\n\n*   **Summary of Identities:**\n    *   **A** = I₂ (Iodine)\n    *   **B** = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n    *   **C** = ICl (Iodine monochloride)\n    *   **D** = SO₂ (Sulfur dioxide)\n    *   **E** = Product of ICl + 2SO₂\n    *   **F** = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   **G** = HIO₃ (Iodic acid)\n    *   **H** = SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl chloride)\n    This set of identities is consistent with all the qualitative chemical descriptions.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the identity and structure of E.**\n\n*   **Clue 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce the extremely hazardous product E.**\n    Based on our assignments, this reaction is:\n    ICl + 2SO₂ → E\n*   Iodine monochloride (ICl) is a Lewis acid and can form complexes with Lewis bases. Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) can act as a Lewis base, donating an electron pair from its oxygen or sulfur atom.\n*   The reaction with two equivalents of SO₂ suggests the formation of a complex ion where the central iodine atom is coordinated to two SO₂ molecules. The product E is likely the ionic salt [I(SO₂)₂]⁺Cl⁻.\n*   The cation **E = [I(SO₂)₂]⁺** would be the species whose molecular symmetry we need to determine. Such reactive halogen-containing cations can be considered \"extremely hazardous\".\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\n*   The molecule (ion) in question is **[I(SO₂)₂]⁺**.\n*   The central atom is Iodine (I). It is bonded to two sulfur dioxide (SO₂) molecules. The bonding is likely from the sulfur atom of each SO₂ to the iodine.\n*   The arrangement of the atoms will be S-I-S, with the two SO₂ molecules attached to the iodine.\n*   The VSEPR theory predicts that the I atom has one lone pair (from its own valence electrons, considering the positive charge and bonds), leading to a bent geometry for the S-I-S skeleton.\n*   The molecule will have a shape similar to a \"V\".\n*   Let's analyze the symmetry elements for this V-shaped [I(SO₂)₂]⁺ ion:\n    1.  **C₂ axis:** There is a twofold rotational axis passing through the I atom and bisecting the S-I-S angle.\n    2.  **σᵥ mirror plane:** There is a mirror plane that contains all three atoms of the S-I-S skeleton.\n    3.  **σᵥ' mirror plane:** There is a second mirror plane perpendicular to the first one, passing through the C₂ axis.\n*   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound E is the cation [I(SO₂)₂]⁺, which has a bent structure. The molecular symmetry group for this structure is C₂ᵥ.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) D4h\nB) C2v\nC) C2\nD) D∞h\n\nOur derived symmetry group C₂ᵥ matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the corrected step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of compound E and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction clues to identify the compounds.**\n\n*   **Clue 4:** D(g) + B(g) → H (1:1 ratio), H is a solvent. The reaction SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l) is a perfect match. Sulfuryl chloride (H) is a solvent. This implies {B, D} = {Cl₂, SO₂}.\n*   **Clue 3:** C + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid). This is a hydrolysis reaction. If C is a chloride, its hydrolysis would produce HCl (a strong acid, F). This suggests B = Cl₂ and D = SO₂.\n*   **Clue 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product). With B = Cl₂, the reaction is A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → C. A well-known reaction involves iodine: I₂(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2ICl(s). Iodine monochloride (ICl) is a red-brown solid, fitting the \"bright red\" description. The 1:8 stoichiometry is likely a red herring, as the qualitative descriptions are chemically consistent.\n*   Let's verify this set of identities with Clue 3 again. If A = I₂ and C = ICl, the hydrolysis is: 5ICl + 3H₂O → 5HCl + HIO₃ + 2I₂. This reaction regenerates solid A (I₂), and produces a strong acid F (HCl) and a weak acid G (HIO₃). This is a perfect fit.\n*   **Summary of Identities:**\n    *   A = I₂ (Iodine)\n    *   B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n    *   C = ICl (Iodine monochloride)\n    *   D = SO₂ (Sulfur dioxide)\n    *   F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   G = HIO₃ (Iodic acid)\n    *   H = SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl chloride)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the identity and structure of E.**\n\n*   **Clue 2:** C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce the extremely hazardous product E.\n*   The reaction is: ICl + 2SO₂ → E.\n*   ICl acts as a Lewis acid and reacts with the Lewis base SO₂ to form the ionic salt [I(SO₂)₂]⁺Cl⁻. The product E is the cation [I(SO₂)₂]⁺. Such reactive species are known to be hazardous.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\n*   The species is the cation **E = [I(SO₂)₂]⁺**. We need to determine its geometry using VSEPR theory.\n*   The central atom is Iodine. Since the overall charge is +1, we consider the central atom to be I⁺.\n*   Iodine (Group 17) has 7 valence electrons. Therefore, I⁺ has 7 - 1 = 6 valence electrons.\n*   The two SO₂ molecules are the ligands (X), bonded to the central iodine atom (A).\n*   The number of lone pairs (E) on the central atom is calculated as: E = (Valence electrons on I⁺ - electrons used in bonding) / 2. Assuming single bonds to the two sulfur atoms, this is E = (6 - 2) / 2 = 2 lone pairs.\n*   The VSEPR notation for [I(SO₂)₂]⁺ is **AX₂E₂**.\n*   An AX₂E₂ species has a tetrahedral electron-pair geometry, which results in a **bent** or **V-shaped** molecular geometry.\n*   A bent molecule of the general formula Y-X-Y has the following symmetry elements:\n    1.  A C₂ rotational axis passing through the central atom (I) and bisecting the Y-X-Y angle (S-I-S angle).\n    2.  Two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) that both contain the C₂ axis. One plane contains the S-I-S atoms, and the other is perpendicular to it.\n*   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E, the [I(SO₂)₂]⁺ cation, is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<B>>>"
