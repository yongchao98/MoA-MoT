    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lower limit on the redshift for detecting the Lyman-alpha line with ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Information:**\n    *   **Spectral Line:** Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of neutral hydrogen.\n    *   **Rest Wavelength (λ_rest):** The problem states this is ~1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n    *   **Detection Method:** Ground-based optical telescopes.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the *lower limit* on the redshift (z) that makes this line detectable.\n\n2.  **Understand the Constraint of Ground-Based Telescopes:**\n    *   Telescopes on the ground must look through the Earth's atmosphere.\n    *   The Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to the ozone layer, absorbs most of the incoming ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\n    *   The \"optical window\" is the range of wavelengths that can pass through the atmosphere and reach the ground. This window begins at the boundary between UV and visible light.\n    *   For practical purposes in astronomy, the atmospheric cutoff wavelength (the shortest wavelength that can be reliably observed from the ground) is approximately 3500 Å to 4000 Å. Let's use a value around 3500 Å as a reasonable estimate for where observations become feasible.\n\n3.  **Understand the Concept of Redshift:**\n    *   Redshift (z) describes how much the wavelength of light from a distant object is stretched due to the expansion of the universe.\n    *   The formula relating the rest wavelength (λ_rest) and the observed wavelength (λ_observed) is:\n        `λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)`\n\n4.  **Connect the Concepts to Find the Lower Limit:**\n    *   The Lyman-alpha line, with a rest wavelength of 1216 Å, is in the UV and cannot be seen from the ground.\n    *   For it to be detected, it must be redshifted to a longer wavelength that falls within the optical window.\n    *   The *lower limit* on the redshift corresponds to the minimum amount of stretching required for the light to just pass through the atmospheric barrier.\n    *   Therefore, we need to find the redshift `z` that shifts the 1216 Å line to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength (`λ_cutoff` ≈ 3500 Å).\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Set the observed wavelength equal to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength:\n        `λ_observed = λ_cutoff ≈ 3500 Å`\n    *   Use the redshift formula to solve for `z`:\n        `1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest`\n    *   Substitute the values:\n        `1 + z = 3500 Å / 1216 Å`\n    *   Calculate the ratio:\n        `1 + z ≈ 2.88`\n    *   Solve for `z`:\n        `z ≈ 2.88 - 1`\n        `z ≈ 1.88`\n\n6.  **Compare the Result with the Given Options:**\n    *   The calculated redshift is `z ≈ 1.88`.\n    *   Let's look at the options provided:\n        A) 1.2\n        B) 1.9\n        C) 2.4\n        D) 3\n    *   The calculated value of 1.88 is extremely close to option B) 1.9.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **The exact atmospheric cutoff:** The cutoff is not a sharp line. Atmospheric transmission gradually decreases at shorter wavelengths. The value of ~3500 Å is a standard and practical estimate for the beginning of the observable optical window from a good ground-based site.\n*   **Meaning of \"Lower Limit\":** Any redshift *higher* than this limit would shift the Lyman-alpha line to an even longer, more easily observable wavelength (e.g., into the blue or green part of the spectrum). The question specifically asks for the minimum redshift required for detection, which is why we use the shortest possible observable wavelength.\n*   **Verification:** We can check what observed wavelength a redshift of 1.9 gives: `λ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.9) = 1216 Å * 2.9 = 3526.4 Å`. This is a perfect match for the atmospheric cutoff wavelength, confirming that z=1.9 is the correct lower limit.\n\n<<<B>>>",
