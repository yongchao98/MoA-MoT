    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the astrophysics question.

    The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift (z) for the Lyman-alpha line
    to be detectable by ground-based optical telescopes.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Identify the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line (λ_rest).
    2.  Identify the constraint: Ground-based optical telescopes can only detect light
        that passes through the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere blocks most UV light.
        The "optical window" starts at a certain minimum wavelength (λ_cutoff).
    3.  The Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted enough so that its observed wavelength
        (λ_observed) is greater than or equal to this cutoff wavelength.
    4.  The redshift formula is: λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z).
    5.  The condition for detection is: λ_rest * (1 + z) >= λ_cutoff.
    6.  We test each option to find the smallest redshift 'z' that satisfies this condition.
