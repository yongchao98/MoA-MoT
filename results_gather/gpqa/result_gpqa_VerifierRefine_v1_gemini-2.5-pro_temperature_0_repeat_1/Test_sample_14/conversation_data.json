    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 (P₁) and Planet_2 (P₂) to decide which one is a better target for observation. We need to calculate the ratio P₁ / P₂.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star, assuming a random orbital inclination, is given by the ratio of the star's radius (R_star) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).\n    *   `P_transit ≈ R_star / a`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Probability Ratio:** We can write the probabilities for each planet and then find their ratio:\n    *   Probability for Planet_1: `P₁ = R_s1 / a₁`\n    *   Probability for Planet_2: `P₂ = R_s2 / a₂`\n    *   The ratio is: `P₁ / P₂ = (R_s1 / a₁) / (R_s2 / a₂) = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a₂ / a₁)`\n\n4.  **List and Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   **Planet Masses:** The planets have the same mass. This information is not needed for the transit probability calculation and can be ignored.\n    *   **Orbital Periods (T):** The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So, `T₁ = T₂ / 3`.\n    *   **Host Star Masses (M_s):** The star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive as the star hosting Planet_2. So, `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n    *   **Host Star Radii (R_s):** Both host stars have the same radii. So, `R_s1 = R_s2`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁):**\n    *   To find the relationship between the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. The law states that the square of the orbital period (T²) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a³) and inversely proportional to the mass of the host star (M_s).\n    *   `T² ∝ a³ / M_s`\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for 'a': `a³ ∝ M_s * T²`, which means `a ∝ (M_s * T²)^(1/3)`.\n    *   Now, let's find the ratio `a₁ / a₂`:\n        `a₁ / a₂ = [ (M_s1 * T₁²) / (M_s2 * T₂²) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   Substitute the known relationships from Step 4:\n        `a₁ / a₂ = [ ( (2 * M_s2) * (T₂ / 3)² ) / (M_s2 * T₂²) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `a₁ / a₂ = [ (2 * M_s2 * T₂² / 9) / (M_s2 * T₂²) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   Cancel out `M_s2` and `T₂²` from the numerator and denominator:\n        `a₁ / a₂ = (2 / 9)^(1/3)`\n    *   We need the inverse of this ratio, `a₂ / a₁`:\n        `a₂ / a₁ = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Probability Ratio (P₁ / P₂):**\n    *   Go back to the formula from Step 3: `P₁ / P₂ = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a₂ / a₁)`\n    *   Substitute the known values:\n        *   `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1` (since the radii are the same).\n        *   `a₂ / a₁ = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)`.\n    *   So, `P₁ / P₂ = 1 * (4.5)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n    *   Calculate the numerical value:\n        `P₁ / P₂ ≈ 1.65096`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The ratio `P₁ / P₂` is approximately 1.65.\n    *   This means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting.\n    *   Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The fact that the planets have the same mass is a distractor; planet mass does not factor into the geometric transit probability.\n*   **Kepler's Law:** It is crucial to use the correct form of Kepler's Third Law (`T² ∝ a³ / M_s`) and not forget the stellar mass dependency.\n*   **Ratios:** Be careful when setting up the ratios.
