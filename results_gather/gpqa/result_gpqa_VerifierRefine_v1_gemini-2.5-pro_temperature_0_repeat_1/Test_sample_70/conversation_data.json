    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be written as T₄ / T₂.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T₄ / T₂.\n    T₄ = T_star * (1 - A₄)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₄))\n    T₂ = T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))\n\n    The ratio is:\n    T₄ / T₂ = [T_star * (1 - A₄)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₄))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio by Canceling Common Terms:**\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so `A₄ = A₂`. This means the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels out.\n    *   The constant `2` in the square root cancels out.\n\n    After simplification, the ratio becomes:\n    T₄ / T₂ = sqrt(1 / a₄) / sqrt(1 / a₂)\n    T₄ / T₂ = sqrt(a₂ / a₄)\n    T₄ / T₂ = (a₂ / a₄)^(1/2)\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis (a) to Orbital Period (P) using Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This can be rearranged to express `a` in terms of `P`:\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute the Kepler's Law Relationship into the Temperature Ratio:** Now we can substitute the relationship for the semi-major axis ratio (a₂ / a₄) into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    a₂ / a₄ = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)\n\n    Substituting this into T₄ / T₂ = (a₂ / a₄)^(1/2):\n    T₄ / T₂ = [(P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)]^(1/2)\n    T₄ / T₂ = (P₂ / P₄)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T₄ / T₂ = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Use the Given Orbital Period Ratios:** The problem gives the period ratios as P₁ : P₂ : P₃ : P₄ : P₅ = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    From this, we can find the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Substitute the period ratio into the final equation:\n    T₄ / T₂ = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    First, simplify the fraction:\n    2 / 3.5 = 20 / 35 = 4 / 7\n    So, T₄ / T₂ = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n\n    Now, calculate the value:\n    4 / 7 ≈ 0.5714\n    T₄ / T₂ ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n    Calculating the cube root:\n    (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8299...\n\n    This value is approximately 0.83.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Ratio:** Ensure you are calculating T₄ / T₂ and not the inverse.\n*   **Formula Simplification:** The key to solving this problem is realizing that since the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, most terms in the equilibrium temperature formula cancel out, leaving a simple relationship between temperature and semi-major axis (T ∝ a^(-1/2)).\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** Correctly applying Kepler's Third Law (P² ∝ a³) is crucial to relate the semi-major axis to the given orbital periods.\n*   **Exponent Rules:** Be careful with the exponents when combining the formulas. The final relationship is T ∝ P^(-1/3).\n*   **Numerical Calculation:** The final step involves calculating a cube root. Estimating or using a calculator shows that (4/7)^(1/3) is very close to 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>",
