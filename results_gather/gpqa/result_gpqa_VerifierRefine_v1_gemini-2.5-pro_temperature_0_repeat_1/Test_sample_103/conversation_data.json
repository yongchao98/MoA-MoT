    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Given Data:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift of the host star's spectral lines. The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's velocity as it \"wobbles\" due to the planet's gravitational pull.\n    *   The Doppler shift formula states that the change in wavelength (Δλ) is proportional to the radial velocity (v_r) of the source: Δλ/λ₀ = v_r/c.\n    *   The amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift (let's call it Δλ_max) is therefore directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (usually denoted as K).\n    *   So, we have K ∝ Δλ_max.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Star's Velocity Amplitudes (K):**\n    *   For planet #1, the wavelength shift amplitude is Δλ_max1 = 5 miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, the wavelength shift amplitude is Δλ_max2 = 7 miliangstrom.\n    *   Since K is proportional to Δλ_max, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is:\n        K₂ / K₁ = Δλ_max2 / Δλ_max1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n3.  **Relate the Star's Velocity Amplitude (K) to the Planet's Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), the star's velocity amplitude K can be expressed by the following formula, especially when the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_s):\n    K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * M_p * sin(i) ) / ( M_s^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )\n    Where:\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_s is the star's mass.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship Using the Problem's Constraints:**\n    The problem states that several parameters are the same for both systems:\n    *   The star masses are the same (M_s1 = M_s2).\n    *   The planet masses are the same (M_p1 = M_p2).\n    *   We must assume the orbital inclinations are the same (sin(i)₁ = sin(i)₂) for the problem to be solvable, as this factor is inherent to the RV measurement.\n    *   G and 2π are constants.\n\n    Given these constants, the formula simplifies to a direct proportionality between K and P:\n    K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    *   From the proportionality K ∝ P^(-1/3), we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n        K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n    *   We need to solve for the ratio of the periods, P₂ / P₁. Let's rearrange the equation:\n        First, cube both sides: (K₂ / K₁)^3 = P₁ / P₂\n        Then, take the reciprocal of both sides to find P₂ / P₁:\n        P₂ / P₁ = 1 / (K₂ / K₁)^3 = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n    *   We know that K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5, so K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7.\n    *   Now, substitute this value into the equation:\n        P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Numerical Value:**\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Key Assumption:** The solution depends on the assumption that the orbital inclinations (`i`) are the same for both systems. Since the problem provides planet \"masses\" rather than \"minimum masses\" (M_p*sin(i)), this assumption is implied.\n*   **Proportionality:** It is crucial to correctly derive the relationship K ∝ P^(-1/3). A mistake here would lead to an incorrect answer. For instance, simply taking the ratio of the shifts (1.4) or its inverse (~0.71) would be wrong.\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger velocity shift (K₂ > K₁). A larger velocity shift implies the star is being pulled harder or faster, which happens when the planet is orbiting closer and therefore has a shorter period. Thus, we should expect P₂ to be shorter than P₁, meaning the ratio P₂ / P₁ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this check.\n\nThe final calculated ratio matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
