def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the exoplanet period ratio problem.

    The verification process follows these steps:
    1.  Define the given parameters from the question.
    2.  Replicate the physical reasoning and mathematical derivation provided in the answer.
        a. Establish the relationship between wavelength shift (Δλ) and stellar velocity amplitude (K).
        b. Establish the relationship between stellar velocity amplitude (K) and planetary orbital period (P) based on the provided constraints.
        c. Combine these to find the relationship between Δλ and P.
    3.  Calculate the expected numerical result based on the derived formula.
    4.  Compare the calculated result with the value corresponding to the LLM's chosen answer ('C').
    5.  Determine if the LLM's choice is the closest and most logical one.

    # 1. Define Given Parameters and LLM's Answer
    # Wavelength shift amplitude for star #1
    delta_lambda_1 = 5.0  # in miliangstrom
    # Wavelength shift amplitude for star #2
    delta_lambda_2 = 7.0  # in miliangstrom

    # The LLM's chosen answer
    llm_choice = 'C'

    # 2. Replicate Physical Reasoning and Derivation

    # 2a. The star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the
    #     observed wavelength shift amplitude (Δλ).
    #     K ∝ Δλ  =>  K₂/K₁ = Δλ₂/Δλ₁
    try:
        K_ratio_2_over_1 = delta_lambda_2 / delta_lambda_1
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Constraint Error: The wavelength shift for planet #1 (Δλ₁) cannot be zero."

    # 2b. For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude K is given by:
    #     K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * M_p * sin(i) ) / ( M_s^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )
    #     The problem states that star masses (M_s) and planet masses (M_p) are the same for both systems.
    #     A necessary assumption, correctly identified by the LLM, is that the orbital inclinations (i) are also the same.
    #     With these constraints, all terms except the period (P) are constant.
    #     This simplifies to the proportionality: K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)
    #     This key physical relationship is correctly identified in the LLM's answer.

    # 2c. From the proportionality, we can derive the ratio of the periods (P₂/P₁).
    #     K₂/K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁/P₂)^(1/3)
    #     To solve for P₂/P₁, we cube both sides and take the reciprocal:
    #     (K₂/K₁)^3 = P₁/P₂
    #     P₂/P₁ = 1 / (K₂/K₁)^3 = (K₁/K₂)^3
    #     This derivation matches the one in the LLM's answer.

    # 3. Calculate the Expected Numerical Result
    # Substitute the known values into the derived formula.
    # P₂/P₁ = (Δλ₁/Δλ₂)^3
    calculated_period_ratio = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2) ** 3
