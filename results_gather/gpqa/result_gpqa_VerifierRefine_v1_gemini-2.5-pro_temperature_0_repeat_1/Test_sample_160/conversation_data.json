    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define Mean Free Path (λ)**\n    The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze λ₁: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n    *   λ₁ represents the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other identical gas molecules.\n    *   In this case, both the projectile particle and the target particles are gas molecules moving with thermal velocities. Because the target particles are also in motion, the collision frequency is higher than if they were stationary. This introduces a correction factor of √2.\n    *   The formula for λ₁ is:\n        λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   Here, `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. Using a simple hard-sphere model, if a gas molecule has a radius `r_g`, a collision occurs if the center of another molecule comes within a distance of `r_g + r_g = 2r_g`. The cross-sectional area is therefore `σ_gg = π * (2r_g)² = 4πr_g²`.\n    *   So, `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * 4πr_g²)`.\n\n3.  **Analyze λ₂: Mean Free Path of Electrons**\n    *   λ₂ represents the mean free path of an electron from the beam colliding with the residual gas molecules.\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them highly relativistic and moving at a speed very close to the speed of light. This speed is vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets. The √2 correction factor does not apply here.\n    *   The formula for λ₂ is:\n        λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   Here, `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule. Since the electron is effectively a point particle compared to the size of a molecule (`r_e` << `r_g`), the collision cross-section is determined by the size of the target molecule. The effective area is `σ_eg ≈ π * (r_g + r_e)² ≈ πr_g²`.\n    *   So, `λ₂ = 1 / (n * πr_g²)`.\n\n4.  **Compare λ₁ and λ₂**\n    *   We have the expressions for both mean free paths:\n        λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * 4πr_g²)\n        λ₂ = 1 / (n * πr_g²)\n    *   To compare them, let's find the ratio λ₂ / λ₁:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * πr_g²)] / [1 / (√2 * n * 4πr_g²)]\n    *   Simplifying the expression:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * 4πr_g²) / (n * πr_g²)\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = 4√2\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Result**\n    *   The value of √2 is approximately 1.414.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio is:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n    *   This means `λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Particle Size:** The collision cross-section for two molecules of radius `r_g` is `4πr_g²`, while the cross-section for a point-like electron hitting a molecule of radius `r_g` is `πr_g²`. This factor of 4 makes λ₂ larger than λ₁.\n*   **Relative Velocity:** The √2 factor in the denominator for λ₁ accounts for the fact that the target gas molecules are also moving. For λ₂, the electron is so fast that the targets are effectively stationary, so this factor is absent. This also makes λ₂ larger than λ₁.\n*   **Conclusion:** Both physical effects (particle size and relative velocity) lead to the conclusion that the mean free path for an electron in the gas (λ₂) is significantly longer than the mean free path for a gas molecule within the same gas (λ₁).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOur calculation shows that λ₂ is approximately 5.66 times larger than λ₁. We need to compare this result with the given options:\nA) λ₂ < λ₁ (Incorrect)\nB) λ₂ = λ₁ (Incorrect)\nC) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁ (Incorrect, as 5.66 is not less than 1.22)\nD) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁ (Correct, as 5.66 is greater than or equal to 1.22)\n\nEven if we use a more conservative model where the cross-sections are assumed to be equal (`σ_gg = σ_eg`), the ratio would be `λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 ≈ 1.414`, which still satisfies `λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁`. The fundamental physics dictates that λ₂ must be greater than λ₁.\n\n<<<D>>>",
