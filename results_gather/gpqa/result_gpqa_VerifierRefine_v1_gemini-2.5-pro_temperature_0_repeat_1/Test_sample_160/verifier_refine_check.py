    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by programmatically
    verifying the physical reasoning provided.

    The answer's logic is based on comparing the mean free paths:
    λ1: Mean free path for gas-gas collisions.
    λ2: Mean free path for electron-gas collisions.

    The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where n is number density and σ is the cross-section.
    """

    # According to the provided analysis:
    # 1. For λ1 (gas-gas), the formula is λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)
    #    The sqrt(2) factor accounts for the relative motion of gas molecules.
    #    The cross-section for two identical spheres of radius r_g is σ_gg = 4 * pi * r_g^2.
    #    So, λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * 4 * pi * r_g^2)

    # 2. For λ2 (electron-gas), the formula is λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)
    #    The sqrt(2) factor is absent because electrons are much faster than gas molecules,
    #    making the gas molecules effectively stationary targets.
    #    The cross-section for a point-like electron and a sphere of radius r_g is σ_eg = pi * r_g^2.
    #    So, λ2 = 1 / (n * pi * r_g^2)

    # 3. The ratio λ2 / λ1 is calculated as:
    #    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * pi * r_g^2)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * 4 * pi * r_g^2)]
    #    λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * n * 4 * pi * r_g^2) / (n * pi * r_g^2)
    #    After canceling terms (n, pi, r_g^2), the ratio simplifies to:
    #    λ2 / λ1 = 4 * sqrt(2)

    ratio_lambda2_to_lambda1 = 4 * math.sqrt(2)

    # The selected answer is D, which states: λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1
    # This is equivalent to checking if the ratio (λ2 / λ1) is >= 1.22.
    
    is_d_correct = ratio_lambda2_to_lambda1 >= 1.22

    if not is_d_correct:
        return (f"Incorrect. The derived ratio of λ2/λ1 is {ratio_lambda2_to_lambda1:.4f}. "
                f"This value does not satisfy the condition for option D (>= 1.22).")

    # The LLM's answer also considers a "conservative model" where cross-sections are equal.
    # In that case, the ratio would just be sqrt(2). Let's check that as a lower bound.
    conservative_ratio = math.sqrt(2)
    is_d_correct_conservative = conservative_ratio >= 1.22

    if not is_d_correct_conservative:

                f"the ratio λ2/λ1 is {conservative_ratio:.4f}, which does not satisfy the condition for option D (>= 1.22). "
                f"This would invalidate the answer's reasoning.")

    # Since both the full model (ratio ≈ 5.657) and the conservative model (ratio ≈ 1.414)
    # result in a ratio greater than 1.22, the conclusion that λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1 is robust
    # and follows directly from the physical principles outlined.
    # The answer D is therefore correct.
