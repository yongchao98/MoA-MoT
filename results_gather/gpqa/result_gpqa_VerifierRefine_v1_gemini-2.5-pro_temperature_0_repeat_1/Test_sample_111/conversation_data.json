    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Normalize the initial state |alpha>**\n\nThe state of the electron is given as being proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`. In vector notation, where `|up>` is `[1, 0]^T` and `|down>` is `[0, 1]^T`, the unnormalized state vector is:\n`|alpha_un> = [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n\nTo normalize this state, we need to divide it by its norm. The squared norm is the sum of the squared magnitudes of its components:\n`<alpha_un|alpha_un> = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2`\nRecall that for a complex number `z = a + ib`, its squared magnitude is `|z|^2 = a^2 + b^2`.\n`|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2`\n`|2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5`\n\nSo, the squared norm is `2 + 5 = 7`. The norm is `sqrt(7)`.\nThe normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down> ]`\nIn vector form:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n\n**Step 2: Determine the matrix representation of the operator A**\n\nThe operator `A` is defined by its matrix elements `Aij` in the `{|up>, |down>}` basis.\n*   `Aij = 0` if `i = j` (diagonal elements are zero). So, `A11 = 0` and `A22 = 0`.\n*   `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j` (off-diagonal elements are `hbar/2`). So, `A12 = hbar/2` and `A21 = hbar/2`.\n\nThe matrix for operator `A` is:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]`\nThis can also be written as `A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x`, where `sigma_x` is the Pauli-X matrix.\n\n**Step 3: Find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the operator A**\n\nTo find the probabilities of measurement, we need to find the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates of `A`. We solve the eigenvalue equation `A|v> = lambda|v>`.\nThe characteristic equation is `det(A - lambda*I) = 0`:\n`det([[ -lambda, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -lambda ]]) = 0`\n`(-lambda)(-lambda) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`lambda^2 = (hbar/2)^2`\nThe eigenvalues are `lambda_1 = +hbar/2` and `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (eigenstates).\n*   For `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:\n    `[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] * [[a], [b]] = 0`\n    This gives `-a + b = 0`, so `a = b`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]^T`.\n    The normalized eigenvector is `|v1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T`.\n\n*   For `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:\n    `[[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] * [[a], [b]] = 0`\n    This gives `a + b = 0`, so `a = -b`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]^T`.\n    The normalized eigenvector is `|v2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `lambda_i` is given by `P(lambda_i) = |<vi|alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   Probability of measuring `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:\n    `<v1| = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]`\n    `<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n    `<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ 1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i) ]`\n    `<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    `P(+hbar/2) = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   Probability of measuring `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:\n    `<v2| = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]`\n    `<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n    `<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ 1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i) ]`\n    `<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)`\n    `P(-hbar/2) = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe two probabilities are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the average value (expectation value) of A**\n\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   Method 1: Using the formula `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`\n    `<alpha| = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1-i), (2+i) ]`\n    `A|alpha> = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T = (hbar/(2*sqrt(7))) * [ (2-i), (1+i) ]^T`\n    `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1-i), (2+i) ] * (hbar/(2*sqrt(7))) * [ (2-i), (1+i) ]^T`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - i - 2i + i^2) + (2 + 2i + i + i^2) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ] = (hbar/14) * 2 = **hbar/7**`\n\n*   Method 2: Using the eigenvalues and probabilities\n    `<A> = P(lambda_1)*lambda_1 + P(lambda_2)*lambda_2`\n    `<A> = (9/14)*(+hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = **hbar/7**`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are `9/14 ≈ 0.64` and `5/14 ≈ 0.36`.
