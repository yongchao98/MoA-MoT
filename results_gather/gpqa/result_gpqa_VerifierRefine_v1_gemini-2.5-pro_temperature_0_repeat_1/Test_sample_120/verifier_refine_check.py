    2.  Stereoselectivity: Inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon (S_N2).
    3.  Product Constitution: The resulting molecular structure and IUPAC numbering.
    4.  Final Stereochemistry: The R/S configuration of all chiral centers, accounting
        for potential changes in Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities.
