            f"2. **Summation Calculation (S):**\n"
            f"   - The sum over the given phase shifts is S = (1)sin^2(90°) + (3)sin^2(67°) + (5)sin^2(55°) + (7)sin^2(30°) + (9)sin^2(13°).\n"
            f"   - The calculated value is S ≈ {S:.4f}.\n\n"
            f"3. **Wave Number Calculation (k) for E_kin = 50 MeV:**\n"
            f"   - Using the relativistic formula (pc)^2 = E_kin * (E_kin + 2*m_e*c^2):\n"
            f"   - (pc)^2 = {E_kin} * ({E_kin} + 2 * {M_E_C2}) = {pc_squared:.2f} MeV^2\n"
            f"   - pc = sqrt({pc_squared:.2f}) = {pc:.4f} MeV\n"
            f"   - k = pc / (hbar*c) = {pc:.4f} MeV / {HBAR_C} MeV fm = {k:.5f} fm^-1.\n\n"
            f"4. **Final Calculation of Im[f(0)]:**\n"
            f"   - Im[f(0)] = S / k = {S:.4f} / {k:.5f} fm = {calculated_im_f0:.3f} fm.\n\n"
            f"5. **Conclusion:**\n"
            f"   - The correct value calculated from the question's parameters is approximately {calculated_im_f0:.3f} fm.\n"
            f"   - The LLM's answer is {llm_answer} fm (Option D).\n"
            f"   - These values are significantly different. The calculated result is almost exactly one-tenth of the LLM's answer.\n"
            f"   - The LLM's response correctly identifies this issue and assumes a typo in the question's energy (i.e., that E_kin should be ~5 MeV, not 50 MeV) to arrive at option D. However, an answer must be correct for the question *as it is written*. Therefore, based on the provided data, the answer D is incorrect."
