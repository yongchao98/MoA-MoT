    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Decay**\n\n*   **The Process:** A stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) decays into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_{\\mu}$). The reaction is: $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_{\\mu}$.\n*   **Initial State:** The pion is stationary. This means its initial momentum is zero ($p_{\\pi} = 0$) and its initial kinetic energy is zero. Its total initial energy is its rest mass energy, $E_{\\pi} = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n*   **Final State:** The decay produces two particles, a muon and a neutrino. They will move off in opposite directions to conserve momentum.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** This decay must obey the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**2. List the Given Information and Assumptions**\n\n*   Rest mass energy of the pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Rest mass energy of the muon ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV.\n*   The neutrino ($\\nu$) is assumed to be massless ($m_{\\nu} = 0$). This is a standard and very good approximation for this type of problem.\n\n**3. Apply the Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The total initial momentum is zero since the pion is at rest.\n*   Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    $p_{initial} = p_{final} = 0$\n*   Let the momentum of the muon be $p_{\\mu}$ and the momentum of the neutrino be $p_{\\nu}$.\n    $p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu} = 0$\n*   This implies that the muon and the neutrino fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n    $|p_{\\mu}| = |p_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Apply the Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The total initial energy equals the total final energy.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n*   Initial energy is the rest energy of the pion:\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n*   Final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino:\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n*   The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula: $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the muon ($\\mu^+$): $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the massless neutrino ($\\nu$): $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (m_{\\nu}c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$\n*   So, the energy conservation equation becomes:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**5.

Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE)**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    *   For a massless particle, the total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, and also equal to $pc$.\n    *   $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$\n    *   $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    *   The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy: $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$.\n    *   We can find $KE_{\\mu}$ using the total energy released in the decay (the Q-value).\n    *   Total KE released = (Initial rest mass energy) - (Final rest mass energy)\n    *   $KE_{total} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2 + m_{\\nu}c^2)$\n    *   $KE_{total} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - (105.7 \\text{ MeV} + 0) = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two product particles:\n    *   $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu}$\n    *   $KE_{\\mu} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu}$\n    *   $KE_{\\mu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $KE_{\\mu} \\approx 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**7.
