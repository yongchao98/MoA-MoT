    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Experimental Setup**\n*   **Antigen:** Inner capsid proteins of rotavirus, tagged with GFP. Rotavirus is a pathogen that infects the gut.\n*   **Delivery Route:** Oral gavage in mice. This mimics the natural route of infection and targets the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n*   **Initial Fate of Antigen:** Some is destroyed by stomach acid, and some is trapped in mucus. This is a realistic depiction of the challenges an oral antigen faces.\n*   **Successful Antigen Delivery:** Some fluorescent protein reaches the Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are critical secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine, responsible for initiating immune responses to gut antigens. The fluorescence indicates the antigen has been taken up by cells in this location.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Immune Response**\n*   **Location of Response:** Peyer's patches. This is where adaptive immune responses in the gut are initiated.\n*   **Cellular Activity:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. In response to an antigen, specific lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) that recognize the antigen are activated and begin to divide rapidly. This process is called clonal expansion.\n*   **Genetic Analysis:** The \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells is sequenced. The heavy chain is a component of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the antibodies that B cells produce. The \"variable\" region is the part that directly binds to the antigen.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the Key Finding**\n*   **Observation:** \"High variability\" is found in the sequenced variable heavy chain genes.\n*   **Inference:** This means that among the population of proliferating cells (which all likely started from a few clones that recognized the rotavirus protein), many new mutations have been introduced into the gene that codes for the antigen-binding part of their receptors. This is not the initial diversity present in the mouse's entire B cell repertoire, but rather new diversity being generated *during* the immune response.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Options based on the Analysis**\n\n*   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process occurs in activated B cells and changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG). It determines the antibody's function and location but does **not** alter the *variable* region or its binding specificity. Therefore, it does not account for the high variability in the variable region.\n\n*   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs specifically in activated B cells that are proliferating within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM intentionally introduces a high rate of point mutations into the DNA of the *variable* regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). The purpose is to generate variant antibodies, some of which will have a higher affinity for the antigen. These B cells are then selected to survive and proliferate further (a process called affinity maturation). This perfectly explains the observation of \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a \"proliferating cell population\" in a \"Peyer's patch\" following antigen stimulation.\n\n*   **C) VDJ recombination:** This is the genetic recombination process that occurs in developing B cells in the bone marrow, *before* they ever encounter an antigen. It is responsible for creating the initial, vast repertoire of different B cell receptors. While it creates variability, it is a one-time event for each B cell lineage and does not happen in proliferating cells in a secondary lymphoid organ *in response* to an antigen. The variability described in the question is being actively generated during the immune response, not before it.\n\n*   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system involving a cascade of proteins in the blood and tissues. It helps clear pathogens but has no direct role in altering the genetic makeup of lymphocytes like B cells.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe scenario describes the events of an active B cell response within a germinal center in a Peyer's patch. The key finding of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of these proliferating B cells is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>",
