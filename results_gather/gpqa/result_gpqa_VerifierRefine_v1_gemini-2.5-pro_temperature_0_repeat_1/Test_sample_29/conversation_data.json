    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concept**\nThe question involves the relationship between the light a substance absorbs and the light it emits. The substance is a textile dye, which is described as fluorescent because it \"emits light\". In the process of fluorescence, a molecule absorbs a photon of light, which excites an electron to a higher energy state. The molecule then loses some energy through non-radiative processes (like vibrations) before the electron returns to the ground state, emitting a photon of light. Because some energy is lost before emission, the emitted photon always has lower energy (and thus a longer wavelength) than the absorbed photon. This phenomenon is known as the Stokes shift.\n\n*   **Key Principle:** Energy of absorbed light > Energy of emitted light.\n*   **Consequence:** Wavelength of absorbed light < Wavelength of emitted light.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Wavelength of the Emitted Light**\nWe are given the energy of the emitted light, E_emitted = 2.3393 eV. We can calculate the corresponding wavelength (λ) using the formula:\nE = hc/λ\nwhere:\n*   h is Planck's constant\n*   c is the speed of light\nA very useful constant for these calculations is hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for wavelength:\nλ = hc / E\nλ_emitted = 1240 eV·nm / 2.3393 eV\nλ_emitted ≈ 530.07 nm\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Color of the Emitted Light**\nWe need to find where this wavelength falls within the visible light spectrum.\n*   Violet: ~400-450 nm\n*   Blue: ~450-495 nm\n*   **Green: ~495-570 nm**\n*   Yellow: ~570-590 nm\n*   Orange: ~590-620 nm\n*   Red: ~620-750 nm\n\nA wavelength of 530 nm falls squarely in the **green** region of the spectrum. So, the dye emits green light.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Wavelength and Color of the Absorbed Light**\nBased on the principle of fluorescence (Stokes shift), the absorbed light must have a shorter wavelength than the emitted light.\nλ_absorbed < λ_emitted\nλ_absorbed < 530 nm\n\nNow, let's examine the options provided:\nA) **Yellow:** λ ≈ 570-590 nm. This is longer than 530 nm. Incorrect.\nB) **Violet:** λ ≈ 400-450 nm. This is shorter than 530 nm. Possible.\nC) **Blue:** λ ≈ 450-495 nm. This is shorter than 530 nm. Possible.\nD) **Red:** λ ≈ 620-750 nm. This is longer than 530 nm. Incorrect.\n\n**Step 5: Choose the Most Plausible Answer**\nWe are left with two possibilities: Violet and Blue. For most common organic fluorescent dyes, the absorption and emission spectra are relatively close to each other. The difference between the absorption maximum and the emission maximum (the Stokes shift) is typically not excessively large.\n*   If the dye absorbs **Blue** light (e.g., ~480 nm) and emits green light (530 nm), the Stokes shift is 530 - 480 = 50 nm. This is a very typical value for a fluorescent dye.\n*   If the dye absorbs **Violet** light (e.g., ~430 nm) and emits green light (530 nm), the Stokes shift would be 530 - 430 = 100 nm. While possible, this is a larger shift.\nGiven that green-emitting fluorophores (like fluorescein or Green Fluorescent Protein) are most efficiently excited by blue light, it is most plausible that the absorbed light is blue.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe dye emits green light (λ ≈ 530 nm). Due to the Stokes shift, it must absorb light of a shorter wavelength (higher energy). Of the options given, both blue and violet have shorter wavelengths. However, the absorption peak for a green-emitting dye is most commonly found in the blue region of the spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>",
