    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its States**\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) for the system is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Understand the Energy Function**\n*   The energy of a given state is determined by the equation: E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].\n*   The partition function Z is the sum over all possible microstates of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n*   The formula for the partition function is: Z = Σ_states e^(-βE).\n\n**3. List All Microstates and Calculate Their Energies**\nTo find the partition function, we need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 microstates. We can group the states by their configuration to simplify the calculation.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The energy depends on the product of pairs of spins. Notice that if all spins are flipped (S_i -> -S_i), the products S_iS_j remain unchanged, so the energy is the same. For example, the state (+,+,+) has the same energy as (-,-,-).\n\nLet's categorize the states:\n\n**Category 1: All spins are aligned (all up or all down).**\n*   **State 1: (+1, +1, +1)**\n    *   S1=1, S2=1, S3=1\n    *   E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n*   **State 2: (-1, -1, -1)**\n    *   S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n    *   E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n\nThere are **2 states** with an energy of **E1 = -3J**.\n\n**Category 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\nThis category includes states with two spins up and one down, or one spin up and two down.\n\n*   **Sub-category 2a: Two spins up (+1), one spin down (-1).**\n    *   **State 3: (+1, +1, -1)** -> E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **State 4: (+1, -1, +1)** -> E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **State 5: (-1, +1, +1)** -> E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **Sub-category 2b: One spin up (+1), two spins down (-1).**\n    *   **State 6: (+1, -1, -1)** -> E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **State 7: (-1, +1, -1)** -> E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **State 8: (-1, -1, +1)** -> E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n\nThere are a total of 3 + 3 = **6 states** with an energy of **E2 = J**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We have accounted for all 8 states (2 states from Category 1 + 6 states from Category 2).\n\n**4. Construct the Partition Function (Z)**\nThe partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states. We can use the energy levels and their degeneracies (the number of states with that energy) to write the sum more concisely.\nZ = (degeneracy of E1) × e^(-βE1) + (degeneracy of E2) × e^(-βE2)\n\n*   Substitute the values we found:\n    *   Degeneracy of E1 = -3J is 2.\n    *   Degeneracy of E2 = J is 6.\n\n*   Z = 2 × e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 × e^(-β(J))\n\n*   Simplify the expression:\n    *   Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**5.
