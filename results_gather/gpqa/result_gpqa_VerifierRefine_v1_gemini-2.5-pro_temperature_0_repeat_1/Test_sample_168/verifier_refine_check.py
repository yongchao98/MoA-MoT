    # We use symbolic masses to represent the particles. c=1 for simplicity.

    # For the variant decay: 2*m_A > 2*m_B + 2*m_E
    # The problem implies V is a particle with mass, so m_V > 0 is a key constraint.

    # --- Step 3: Analyze the endpoint of the spectrum ---

    # The endpoint Q is the maximum total energy of the two E particles.
    # This occurs when the other particles (B, V/M) take minimum energy.
    # We assume the recoil kinetic energy of the heavy B nucleons is negligible.
    # The minimum energy of a particle is its rest mass energy (m*c^2).

    # Total energy released from the A->B conversion available to light particles:

    # Endpoint for the variant decay:
    # Minimum energy taken by the massless M particle is zero.
