    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core of the problem is to equate two different phenomena that cause a dip in a star's observed brightness:\n*   **Phenomenon 1: Rotational Modulation due to Starspots.** A cooler, spotted region of the star rotates into view, causing the total brightness to decrease.\n*   **Phenomenon 2: Exoplanet Transit.** A planet passes in front of the star, blocking a portion of its light.\n\nWe need to find the size of a planet (relative to the star) that would cause the same brightness dip as the starspots.\n\n**2. Analyze the Brightness Drop from Starspots**\n\n*   **Key Principle:** The brightness (or more formally, the flux, F) emitted by a surface is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (F ∝ T⁴). The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from all its visible parts.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk of the star has a temperature T_eff.\n    *   Let A_disk be the area of the star's visible disk (A_disk = π * R_star²).\n    *   F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere has a mix of normal (hotter) photosphere and cooler spots.\n    *   **Filling Factor (f):** 20% or 0.20 of the visible disk is covered by spots.\n    *   **Area of spots (A_spot):** A_spot = f * A_disk = 0.20 * A_disk\n    *   **Area of normal photosphere (A_phot):** A_phot = (1 - f) * A_disk = 0.80 * A_disk\n    *   **Temperatures:**\n        *   Normal photosphere temperature: T_eff = 6000 K\n        *   Spot temperature: T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   The total flux at minimum brightness is the sum of the flux from the normal parts and the spotted parts:\n        *   F_min ∝ (A_phot * T_eff⁴) + (A_spot * T_spot⁴)\n        *   F_min ∝ [(1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴] + [f * A_disk * T_spot⁴]\n\n*   **Calculate the Fractional Drop in Brightness (Amplitude):** The amplitude of the signal is the fractional change in flux, which we can write as ΔF / F_max.\n    *   ΔF / F_max = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n    *   Let's find the ratio F_min / F_max:\n        *   F_min / F_max = ([(1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴] + [f * A_disk * T_spot⁴]) / (A_disk * T_eff⁴)\n        *   The A_disk term cancels out. We can also divide the numerator by T_eff⁴:\n        *   F_min / F_max = (1 - f) + f * (T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴) = (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n    *   Now, substitute this back into the amplitude equation:\n        *   ΔF / F_max = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n        *   ΔF / F_max = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n        *   **ΔF / F_max = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]**\n\n*   **Plug in the values:**\n    *   f = 0.20\n    *   T_spot / T_eff = 5000 K / 6000 K = 5/6\n    *   ΔF / F_max = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n    *   ΔF / F_max = 0.20 * [1 - (625 / 1296)]\n    *   ΔF / F_max = 0.20 * [(1296 - 625) / 1296]\n    *   ΔF / F_max = 0.20 * [671 / 1296]\n    *   ΔF / F_max ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the spots cause a brightness drop of approximately 10.36%.\n\n**3. Analyze the Brightness Drop from an Exoplanet Transit**\n\n*   **Key Principle:** During a transit, the planet blocks a circular area of the star's disk. The fractional drop in brightness (known as the transit depth) is simply the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n\n*   **Transit Depth Formula:**\n    *   Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star\n    *   Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n    *   **Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²**\n\n**4. Equate the Two Signals and Solve**\n\nWe need the transit depth to be equal to the brightness drop caused by the spots.\n\n*   (R_pl / R_star)² = ΔF / F_max\n*   (R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n*   To find the ratio of the radii, we take the square root of this value:\n*   R_pl / R_star ≈ √0.10355\n*   **R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218**\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Flux vs. Temperature:** The brightness is proportional to T⁴, not T. This is a critical part of the calculation.\n*   **Area vs. Radius:** The transit depth is a ratio of areas, which means it's proportional to the square of the ratio of radii. Remember to take the square root at the end.\n*   **Filling Factor:** The filling factor `f` applies to the area of the visible disk, not the entire surface of the star.\n*   **Amplitude Definition:** The \"amplitude\" refers to the fractional drop from the maximum, unspotted brightness level.\n*   **Information Provided:** The star's radius being equal to the Sun's is extra information not needed for the final ratio.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  Calculate the fractional brightness drop from spots:\n    `Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴] ≈ 0.1036`\n2.
