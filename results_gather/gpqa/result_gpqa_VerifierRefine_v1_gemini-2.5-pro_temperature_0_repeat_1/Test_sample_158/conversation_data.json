    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the comoving distance of the quasar.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:**\n    The problem describes a quasar spectrum with a peak at 790 nm and a significant drop in flux at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm. This is a classic signature of a high-redshift object. The drop in flux is caused by the absorption of light by the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) between the quasar and Earth. This absorption feature is known as the **Lyman-alpha forest**, which starts immediately to the blue (shorter wavelength) side of the quasar's own Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The most reasonable assumption is that the peak at 790 nm corresponds to the redshifted Lyman-alpha emission line from the quasar.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):**\n    The redshift `z` relates the observed wavelength (λ_obs) of a spectral line to its rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest). The formula is:\n    `1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest`\n    *   The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition of hydrogen is λ_rest ≈ 121.6 nm.\n    *   The observed wavelength is given as λ_obs = 790 nm.\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        `1 + z = 790 nm / 121.6 nm ≈ 6.497`\n        `z ≈ 6.497 - 1 = 5.497`\n    *   So, the redshift of the quasar is approximately **z = 5.5**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Correct Cosmological Formula:**\n    The question asks for the comoving distance (D_c) in a flat Lambda-CDM (ΛCDM) universe. The formula for the line-of-sight comoving distance from an observer at z=0 to an object at redshift z is:\n    `D_c = D_H * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')`\n    where:\n    *   `D_H` is the Hubble distance, `D_H = c / H₀`.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `H₀` is the Hubble constant today.\n    *   `E(z) = H(z) / H₀` is the dimensionless Hubble parameter, which for a flat ΛCDM universe is given by:\n        `E(z) = sqrt( Ω_m,₀ * (1+z)³ + Ω_Λ,₀ )`\n    *   `Ω_m,₀` is the matter density parameter today.\n    *   `Ω_Λ,₀` is the dark energy density parameter today.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to use the correct formula for a flat universe (where the curvature parameter Ω_k,₀ = 0) and the given ΛCDM model.\n\n4.  **Plug in the Cosmological Parameters and Calculate:**\n    We are given:\n    *   H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n    *   Ω_m,₀ = 0.3\n    *   Ω_Λ,₀ = 0.7\n    *   z ≈ 5.5\n    *   c ≈ 3 x 10⁵ km/s\n\n    First, calculate the Hubble distance `D_H`:\n    `D_H = c / H₀ = (3 x 10⁵ km/s) / (70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹) ≈ 4286 Mpc ≈ 4.286 Gpc`\n\n    Next, we need to solve the integral:\n    `Integral = ∫[from 0 to 5.5] dz' / sqrt( 0.3 * (1+z')³ + 0.7 )`\n    *   **Careful Point:** This integral does not have a simple analytical solution and must be calculated numerically. Using a computational tool or a reliable numerical method (like the adaptive quadrature used in scientific libraries) is necessary for accuracy. Simple approximations can lead to significant errors.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral and Find the Final Distance:**\n    Performing the numerical integration (e.g., using a cosmology calculator or a scientific programming library like Python's SciPy) yields:\n    `Integral ≈ 2.09`\n\n    Now, calculate the comoving distance `D_c`:\n    `D_c = D_H * Integral`\n    `D_c ≈ 4286 Mpc * 2.09 ≈ 8958 Mpc`\n\n    Finally, convert the result to Gigaparsecs (Gpc), since the options are in Gpc:\n    `1 Gpc = 1000 Mpc`\n    `D_c ≈ 8.958 Gpc`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated comoving distance is approximately 8.96 Gpc. Let's compare this to the given options:\n    A) 7 Gpc\n    B) 6 Gpc\n    C) 9 Gpc\n    D) 8 Gpc\n\n    The value 8.96 Gpc is extremely close to 9 Gpc.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   Correctly identifying the spectral line as Lyman-alpha based on the description of the spectrum.\n*   Using the standard rest-frame wavelength for Lyman-alpha (121.6 nm).\n*   Using the correct formula for comoving distance in a flat ΛCDM universe.\n*   Recognizing that the integral requires accurate numerical evaluation.\n*   Maintaining consistent units throughout the calculation (km, s, Mpc) and converting to Gpc at the end.\n\nThe analysis robustly points to a comoving distance of approximately 9 Gpc.\n\n<<<C>>>",
