    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by verifying its logical steps and calculations.
    
    The problem's logic path as interpreted by the LLM is:
    1. Identify element Y as Antimony (Sb) and compound A2 as SbF3 based on the mass percentage of Fluorine.
    2. Identify compound A4 as SbF5 based on the comproportionation reaction with Sb to form A5 (SbF3).
    3. Calculate the molecular weight of A4 (SbF5).
    4. Select the range that contains this molecular weight.
