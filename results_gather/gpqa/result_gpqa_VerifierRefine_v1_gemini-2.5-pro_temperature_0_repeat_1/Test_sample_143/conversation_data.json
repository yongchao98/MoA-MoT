    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of the meson X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **List Given Information:**\n    *   Total energy of the meson: $E_{X} = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   Rest mass of the meson: $m_{X} = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}/c^2$\n    *   Decay width of the meson: $\\Gamma_{X} = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n3.  **Identify Necessary Formulas:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle in the lab frame is given by the product of its velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$): $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n    *   Due to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime ($\\tau$, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor): $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$.\n    *   The velocity is expressed as $v = \\beta c$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   Combining these, the formula for the mean decay distance becomes: $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$.\n    *   The proper lifetime $\\tau$ is related to the decay width $\\Gamma$ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Substituting $\\tau$ into the distance formula gives a very convenient form for calculation: $L = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculations:**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):**\n        The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_{X}}{m_{X}c^2} = \\frac{8 \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3}$\n\n    *   **Calculate the velocity factor ($\\beta$):**\n        The velocity factor $\\beta$ is related to $\\gamma$ by the formula $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$.\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(20/3)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{9}{400}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{400 - 9}{400}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{391}{400}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{20}$\n\n    *   **Calculate the product $\\gamma\\beta$:**\n        This product represents the particle's momentum divided by its mass ($p/m$).\n        $\\gamma\\beta = \\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{20}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}$\n        $\\gamma\\beta \\approx \\frac{19.7737}{3} \\approx 6.5912$\n\n    *   **Calculate the mean decay distance ($L$):**\n        Now we use the formula $L = \\gamma\\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$.\n        We will use the value of the physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV·fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m).\n        The decay width is given as $\\Gamma_{X} = 320 \\text{ MeV}$.\n        $L = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}\\right) \\times \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV·fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n        $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times (0.61665) \\text{ fm}$\n        $L \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n\n    *   **Convert to meters:**\n        Since 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m, the mean decay distance is:\n        $L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Units Consistency:** It is crucial to ensure that all units are consistent. The energy and mass were given in GeV, while the width was in MeV. In the final calculation step, $\\hbar c$ was used in MeV·fm and $\\Gamma$ in MeV, which makes the MeV units cancel out correctly, leaving the distance in femtometers (fm).\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle is highly relativistic ($\\gamma \\approx 6.67$), so it is essential to use the relativistic formulas for time dilation and kinematics. The mean decay distance is significantly longer in the lab frame than it would be in the particle's rest frame.\n*   **Choice of Constants:** Using a precise value for $\\hbar c$ is important for matching the options accurately. The value $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV·fm}$ is standard in particle physics calculations.\n*   **Distinction between Lifetime and Width:** Remember that the decay width ($\\Gamma$) is inversely proportional to the proper lifetime ($\\tau$). A larger width implies a shorter lifetime and a more unstable particle.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated mean decay distance is $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
