    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n    *   The initial magnetic field is `B_i = B * k_hat` (in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for the interaction is `H_i = -μ · B_i = - (γS) · (B * k_hat) = -γBS_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of this Hamiltonian.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up, `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (spin down, `|-z>`).\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues are `E = -γB * (eigenvalue of S_z)`.\n        *   For `|+z>`, `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)`.\n        *   For `|-z>`, `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   The lowest energy is `E_+`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle is the spin-up state along the Z-axis.\n    *   Initial state: `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **The Change (at t = 0):**\n    *   The magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched. The Z-direction field is turned off, and a new field `B_f = B * j_hat` (in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n    *   \"Suddenly\" implies that the state of the system does not have time to change. So, at the instant `t=0`, the state is still `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (for t > 0):**\n    *   For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian, `H_f`.\n    *   `H_f = -μ · B_f = - (γS) · (B * j_hat) = -γBS_y`.\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the time evolution operator acting on the initial state:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_f * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γBS_y) * t / ħ) |+z>`\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γB * t * S_y / ħ) |+z>`\n    *   This operator `exp(i * θ * S_y / ħ)` represents a rotation of the state vector around the Y-axis by an angle `θ = γBt`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expectation Value:**\n    *   We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ <S_z>(t)`.\n    *   Let's calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n        `<S_z>(t) = <+z| exp(-i * γB * t * S_y / ħ) * S_z * exp(i * γB * t * S_y / ħ) |+z>`\n    *   This is the expectation value of the time-evolved operator `S_z(t) = U^† S_z U` in the initial state `|+z>`, where `U = exp(i * γB * t * S_y / ħ)`. This is the Heisenberg picture.\n    *   The operator `S_z` transforms under a rotation about the y-axis by an angle `θ = γBt` as:\n        `S_z(t) = S_z * cos(θ) - S_x * sin(θ)`\n        `S_z(t) = S_z * cos(γBt) - S_x * sin(γBt)`\n    *   Now we compute the expectation value:\n        `<S_z>(t) = <+z| (S_z * cos(γBt) - S_x * sin(γBt)) |+z>`\n        `<S_z>(t) = cos(γBt) * <+z|S_z|+z> - sin(γBt) * <+z|S_x|+z>`\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Matrix Elements:**\n    *   `<+z|S_z|+z>`: Since `|+z>` is an eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`, this value is `ħ/2`.\n    *   `<+z|S_x|+z>`: The operator `S_x` can be written as `S_x = (ħ/2)(|+z><-z| + |-z><+z|)`.\n        `<+z|S_x|+z> = (ħ/2) * <+z| (|+z><-z| + |-z><+z|) |+z>`\n        `= (ħ/2) * (<+z|+z><-z|+z> + <+z|-z><+z|+z>)`\n        Since `<+z|+z> = 1` and `<+z|-z> = 0` (orthogonality), this becomes `(ħ/2) * (1*0 + 0*1) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting these values back:\n        `<S_z>(t) = cos(γBt) * (ħ/2) - sin(γBt) * 0 = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n6.  **Finding the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression describes an oscillation. A general cosine oscillation is of the form `A*cos(ωt + φ)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    *   By comparing `cos(γBt)` with `cos(ωt)`, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation.\n    *   Oscillation (angular) frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Initial State:** Correctly identifying the initial state as the lowest energy state (`|+z>`) is crucial.\n*   **\"Sudden\" Approximation:** This means the Hamiltonian changes instantly, but the wavefunction does not.\n*   **Larmor Precession:** The physics described is the quantum mechanical version of Larmor precession.

The standard frequency `f` (in Hz) is related by `ω = 2πf`. The options provided clearly correspond to an angular frequency.\n*   **Calculation Method:** Using the Heisenberg picture for the evolution of operators is often simpler for this type of problem than evolving the state vector in the Schrödinger picture, though both yield the same result.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates as `cos(γBt)`.

The eigenstates of `S_y` are:\n        `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`\n        `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)` with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`\n    *   Inverting these, we get `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n    *   So, `|ψ(0)> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n    *   The time evolution of the `S_y` eigenstates is simple:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iH_f t/ħ) |ψ(0)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-iE_y^+ t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_y^- t/ħ)|-y>]`\n        where `E_y^+ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_y^- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y>]`\n    *   Now we calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.
