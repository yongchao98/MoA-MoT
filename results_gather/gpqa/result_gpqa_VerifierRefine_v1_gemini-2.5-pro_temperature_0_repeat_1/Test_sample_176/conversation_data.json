    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Radius of Star_1: R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n    *   Mass of Star_1: M₁ = 1.5 * M₂\n    *   Peak observed wavelength of Star_1 (λ_obs,1) is equal to the peak observed wavelength of Star_2 (λ_obs,2).\n    *   Radial velocity of Star_1: v_r1 = 0 km/s\n    *   Radial velocity of Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s\n    *   Assumption: Both stars radiate as perfect black bodies.\n\n3.  **Identify Relevant Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** For a spherical black body, luminosity (L) is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature (T) of a black body to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation in its own rest frame (λ_rest). The formula is λ_rest = b/T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to its rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest). For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n4.  **Careful Points and Considerations:**\n    *   **Mass Information:** The mass of the stars (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is provided. However, the problem specifies that the stars should be treated as black bodies, for which the luminosity is determined by radius and temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann Law). The mass-luminosity relation is a different concept and is not needed here. Therefore, the mass information is a distractor.\n    *   **Observed vs. Rest-Frame Wavelength:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars \"appeared brightest\" are the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the Doppler shift due to the stars' motion. Wien's Law, however, relates temperature to the *rest-frame* peak wavelength (λ_rest). We must use the Doppler effect to connect these two.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, we can write the ratio of the luminosities:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nBy canceling the constants (4, π, σ), we get:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂)**\nThis requires relating the temperatures through the given wavelength information.\n*   We are given that the observed peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n*   Let's relate the observed wavelength to the rest-frame wavelength for each star using the Doppler effect formula:\n    *   For Star_1: v_r1 = 0, so λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest,1.\n    *   For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_r2/c).\n*   Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can set the expressions equal:\n    λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_r2/c)\n*   Now, we use Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T) to substitute for the rest-frame wavelengths:\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v_r2/c)\n*   Cancel the constant 'b' and rearrange to find the ratio T₁/T₂:\n    1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * (1 + v_r2/c)\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nSubstitute the known ratios for radius and temperature back into our luminosity ratio equation from Step 1.\n*   We know R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   We found T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c).\n*   Therefore:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v_r2/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r2/c)⁴\n\n**Step 4: Plug in the numerical values and compute.**\n*   v_r2 = 700 km/s = 7 x 10⁵ m/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Calculate the ratio v_r2/c:\n    v_r2/c = (7 x 10⁵) / (3 x 10⁸) = (7/3) x 10⁻³ ≈ 0.002333\n*   Now calculate the denominator:\n    (1 + v_r2/c)⁴ = (1 + 0.002333)⁴ ≈ (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 1.009354\n*   Finally, calculate the luminosity ratio:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009354 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>",
