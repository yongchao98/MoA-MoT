    Checks the correctness of the answer for the drug discovery question.

Using preliminary in vitro (experimental) binding assays to validate which forms are active provides a crucial experimental anchor. This ensures that the computationally expensive docking studies are focused on biologically relevant structures, saving time and resources while dramatically increasing the chances of obtaining meaningful results. This integration of experimental and computational work is a cornerstone of modern drug discovery."

ADME/pharmacokinetic properties are critical for a drug's overall success, but they are typically evaluated *after* a compound has shown promising binding affinity and activity against its target. The immediate goal of docking is to assess binding potential. Therefore, focusing on ADME before even establishing binding is premature."

The specific environment of a protein's binding pocket can stabilize a higher-energy conformer or tautomer. Relying solely on the most stable form could lead to missing the true active compound entirely."

Prioritizing based on calculated physicochemical properties is still entirely predictive and carries a significant risk of being wrong. It lacks the definitive, real-world validation that an experimental binding assay (as proposed in A) provides. Option A is superior because it grounds the computational model in experimental reality."
