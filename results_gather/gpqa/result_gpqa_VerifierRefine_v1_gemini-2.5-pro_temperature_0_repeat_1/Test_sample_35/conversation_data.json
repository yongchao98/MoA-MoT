    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify what kind of interstellar medium in our own galaxy, the Milky Way, would produce an absorption line that, when observed from a distance of 2.1 Gpc, has an energy of 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV. The key is that the observed energy is from a very distant object, meaning it has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe. We need to find the original, un-redshifted (rest-frame) energy of this absorption line to identify the transition and the medium it comes from.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Redshift (z)**\nThe relationship between a galaxy's distance and its recessional velocity (how fast it's moving away from us) is described by Hubble's Law: `v = H₀ * d`. The redshift `z` is related to this velocity.\n\n*   **d (distance):** 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc (since 1 Gpc = 1000 Mpc).\n*   **H₀ (Hubble Constant):** A standard approximate value is H₀ ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc.\n*   **c (speed of light):** Approximately 3 x 10⁵ km/s.\n\nFirst, calculate the recessional velocity `v`:\n`v = 70 km/s/Mpc * 2100 Mpc = 147,000 km/s`\n\nNow, calculate the redshift `z`. For velocities that are not extremely small compared to the speed of light, the simple formula is `z = v / c`.\n`z = 147,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.49`\nSo, the redshift `z` is approximately 0.5.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest)**\nCosmological redshift causes the energy of light to decrease. The relationship between the observed energy (E_obs) and the rest-frame energy (E_rest) is:\n`E_obs = E_rest / (1 + z)`\nWe can rearrange this to find the original energy:\n`E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)`\n\n*   **E_obs:** 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n*   **z:** ≈ 0.5\n\n`E_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.49) ≈ (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * 1.5 = 5.85 * 10⁻⁶ eV`\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Atomic/Molecular Transition**\nWe now have the rest-frame energy of the absorption line: approximately 5.85 * 10⁻⁶ eV. We need to identify what known transition in astrophysics has this energy.\n\nThis is a very low energy, corresponding to a radio wavelength. Let's identify this famous line. The most prominent spectral line in this energy range is the **21 cm line** of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I).\n\n*   The precise energy of the 21 cm line is about **5.87 * 10⁻⁶ eV**.\n*   Our calculated value of 5.85 * 10⁻⁶ eV is extremely close, with the small difference arising from the approximation used for the Hubble constant. This confirms we have identified the correct transition.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Interstellar Medium**\nThe 21 cm line is produced by neutral **atomic** hydrogen. This immediately eliminates the options involving molecular medium (A and D). We are left with:\nB) Warm atomic interstellar medium.\nC) Cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\nThe final careful point is to consider that the observation is of an **absorption line**.\n*   **Emission lines** at 21 cm can come from both warm and cold atomic gas.\n*   **Absorption lines** at 21 cm are only produced when a cloud of **cold** atomic hydrogen lies between us and a hotter, brighter background source (like a distant quasar or radio galaxy). The cold gas absorbs the radio waves from the background source. Warm atomic gas is too thermally excited to produce a significant absorption feature.\n\nTherefore, a 21 cm absorption line is a specific tracer for the **Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe observed redshifted absorption line corresponds to the 21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen. In the Milky Way (or any galaxy), this absorption feature is a signature of the Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium.\n\n<<<C>>>",
