This is known as the branching ratio for that specific path.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Selection Rules for Dipole Transitions**\n\nFor an electric dipole transition from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n*   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n = n' - n$ can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so $n' < n$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since $l=0$, we must have $l' - 0 = +1$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since $m=0$, we must have $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The principal quantum number must decrease. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$, which is a valid decay.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nWe need to check if a transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n\n*   **Intermediate State $|2,1,m'\\rangle$:** $n'=2, l'=1$.\n*   **Final State $|1,0,0\\rangle$:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed as long as $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** All three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$) can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, all three cascade routes are physically possible.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of the Routes**\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. The three possible final states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the non-relativistic theory). Due to the symmetry of the initial state and the degeneracy of the final states, the transition probability must be the same for each of the three possible outcomes.\n    Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability (branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any specific one of them is:\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    Once the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, we must consider its possible decay channels. According to the dipole selection rules, it can only decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$. Since energy must be released ($n$ must decrease), the only available lower-energy shell is $n=1$. The $n=1$ shell only has an $l=0$ subshell. Therefore, the only possible dipole decay from the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.\n    Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this transition occurring, given the atom is in the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, is 1.\n    $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n*   **Total Probability of a Route**\n    The total probability for any of the three specific routes is:\n    $P(\\text{route via } m') = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the Options**\n\nLet's examine the given options based on our findings:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe correct option is the one that describes a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability. Our analysis shows that the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid and has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<D>>>",
