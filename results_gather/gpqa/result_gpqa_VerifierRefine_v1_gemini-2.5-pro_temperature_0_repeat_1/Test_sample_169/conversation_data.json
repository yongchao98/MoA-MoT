    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, `S_y`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the expectation value of the spin operator in the y-direction, denoted as `<S_y>`, for an electron in a given spin state. The formula for the expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ>` is:\n`<A> = <ψ|A|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\nThis formula is essential because the given state may not be normalized.\n\n**2. Define the State Vector (Ket and Bra)**\nThe spin state is given as a column vector (ket):\n`|χ> =`\n`[ 3i ]`\n`[ 4  ]`\n\nThe corresponding bra vector `<χ|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|χ>`.\n-   Transpose of `|χ>` is `[3i, 4]`.\n-   Complex conjugate of `[3i, 4]` is `[-3i, 4]`.\nSo, the bra vector is:\n`<χ| = [-3i, 4]`\n\n**3. Calculate the Normalization Factor `<χ|χ>`**\nThis is the denominator in the expectation value formula.\n`<χ|χ> = [-3i, 4] * [ 3i ]`\n`                  [ 4  ]`\n`<χ|χ> = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n`<χ|χ> = -9i² + 16`\nSince `i² = -1`:\n`<χ|χ> = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\nThe state is not normalized, so we must divide by this factor of 25.\n\n**4. Define the Spin Operator `S_y`**\nThe spin operator `S_y` is related to the Pauli matrix `σ_y` by the formula:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`\nGiven `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`, the operator is:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) *`\n`[ 0  -i ]`\n`[ i   0 ]`\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerator `<χ|S_y|χ>`**\nFirst, we apply the operator `S_y` to the ket `|χ>`:\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]`\n`                 [ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ]`\n`                 [ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`                 [ 3i² ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`                 [ -3  ]`\n\nNext, we multiply this result by the bra `<χ|`:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\nWe can pull the constant `(ħ/2)` to the front:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( [-3i, 4] * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( 12i² - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -12 - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -24 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = -12ħ`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Expectation Value `<S_y>`**\nNow, we divide the numerator by the normalization factor:\n`<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n`<S_y> = -12ħ / 25`\n\nThis can be written as `-12*hbar/25`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **Normalization:** Always check if the state is normalized. If not, you must divide by the inner product `<ψ|ψ>`. Forgetting this is a common error.\n2.  **Bra Vector:** Remember that the bra is the **conjugate** transpose. The complex number `3i` becomes `-3i`.\n3.  **Operator Form:** The spin operator `S_y` includes the factor `ħ/2`. Do not just use the Pauli matrix `σ_y`.\n4.  **Complex Arithmetic:** Be meticulous with calculations involving `i`, especially `i² = -1` and signs during multiplication. For example, `(-3i)(-4i) = +12i² = -12`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe calculated expectation value is `-12ħ/25`, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
