    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents determine both the reactivity of the ring and the position (ortho, meta, or para) of the incoming electrophile.\n\n### Substituent Analysis\n\nFirst, the substituents for each compound are classified:\n\n1.  **C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** -CH₃ is an activating, ortho/para-director.\n2.  **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC₂H₅ is a deactivating, meta-director.\n3.  **C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a deactivating, ortho/para-director.\n4.  **C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** -NO₂ is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n5.  **C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** -C₂H₅ is an activating, ortho/para-director.\n6.  **C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n### Ordering the Substances\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer is significantly lower for meta-directing groups than for ortho/para-directing groups. Therefore, the substances with meta-directors will come first in the sequence (lowest para-isomer yield).\n\n#### 1. Meta-Directors (Lowest Para-Yield)\nThe substances with meta-directing groups are nitrobenzene (4), benzoic acid (6), and ethyl benzoate (2). The strength of deactivation generally follows the order: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅. Stronger deactivation leads to a lower proportion of ortho and para products. Thus, the para-isomer yield will be lowest for the most deactivated ring.\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4)**: The -NO₂ group is a very strong deactivator, resulting in extremely low yields of ortho and para isomers.\n*   **Benzoic acid (6)**: The -COOH group is a strong deactivator, but less so than -NO₂.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (2)**: The -COOC₂H₅ group is also deactivating, but generally considered slightly less deactivating than -COOH.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield among the meta-directors is: `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n#### 2. Ortho/Para-Directors (Higher Para-Yield)\nThe remaining substances have ortho/para-directing groups: toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3). For these groups, the ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Toluene (1)**: The methyl group (-CH₃) is relatively small. The bromination of toluene yields approximately 67% para-isomer and 33% ortho-isomer.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5)**: The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is larger than the methyl group, causing more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increases the preference for para-substitution compared to toluene.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3)**: Halogens are a special case; they are deactivating but ortho/para-directing. The para-isomer is strongly favored due to a combination of electronic and steric factors, with yields of p-bromochlorobenzene around 90%.\n\nBased on typical isomer distributions, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is toluene < ethylbenzene < chlorobenzene. Thus, the order is `1 < 5 < 3`.\n\n### Final Ordering\n\nCombining the two groups gives the final order, from the lowest weight fraction of the para-isomer to the highest:\n\n**C₆H₅-NO₂ < C₆H₅-COOH < C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ < C₆H₅-CH₃ < C₆H₅-C₂H₅ < C₆H₅-Cl**\n\nThis corresponds to the numerical sequence: `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
