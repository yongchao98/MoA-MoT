    "To clearly resolve two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be larger than the energy uncertainty, or \"width,\" of each level. This relationship is governed by the time-energy uncertainty principle.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Time-Energy Uncertainty Principle**: This principle states that the uncertainty in a quantum state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) are related. A common form of the relation is ΔE × Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. A quantum state that exists for only a short time cannot have a precisely defined energy.\n2.  **Natural Linewidth**: The finite lifetime of a quantum state leads to an energy uncertainty known as the natural linewidth. States that decay quickly have a broad linewidth, while states that are long-lived have a narrow one.\n3.  **Resolving Energy Levels**: To distinguish between two energy levels, their energy separation must be greater than their linewidths. The limiting factor for resolution is the level with the *larger* energy uncertainty, which corresponds to the *shorter* lifetime.\n\n### Calculation\n\nFirst, we must identify the state that limits our ability to distinguish the levels.\n*   State 1 has a lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n*   State 2 has a lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n\nThe energy uncertainty (ΔE) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (τ). Therefore, the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) will have the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁). For the levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them must be greater than ΔE₁.\n\nWe can calculate the minimum energy uncertainty for State 1 using the uncertainty principle, where we can approximate Δt ≈ τ. A commonly used form of the relation for lifetime calculations is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\nThe value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**Energy uncertainty for State 1:**\n\nΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\nΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\nΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nTo clearly resolve the two states, the energy difference must be greater than this value (~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV and thus not sufficient.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is significantly larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the required energy separation.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is smaller than the required energy separation.\n\nThe only option that provides a large enough energy difference to clearly distinguish the two levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
