    "The problem describes the probabilistic nature of single-atom radioactive decay, which is governed by the principles of the exponential distribution. A key characteristic of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed without decaying.\n\n**Applying the Memoryless Property**\n\nThe fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to calculating the decay probability of a new atom over a period of 150 minutes.\n\n**Calculation**\n\nFirst, we determine the decay constant (λ) from the information provided. The decay probability, P(t), over a time t is given by the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32.\n\n*   P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32\n\nFrom this, we can find the probability of survival, S(100):\n\n*   S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless property, this is simply the probability that a new atom would decay within 150 minutes, P(150).\n\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)\n\nTo calculate this without explicitly finding λ, we can use the survival probability we already found:\n\n*   e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nNow, we can compute the value:\n\n*   (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, we calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes:\n\n*   P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\nThis probability, when converted to a percentage, is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nThus, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is about 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
