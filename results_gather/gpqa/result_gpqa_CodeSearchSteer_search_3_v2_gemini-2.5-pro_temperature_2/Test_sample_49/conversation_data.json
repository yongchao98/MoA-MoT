    "The question at hand is to determine the number of loops in a Feynman diagram from a mathematical expression representing its \"size estimate.\" This type of problem arises in quantum field theory, where loop diagrams correspond to quantum corrections in the calculation of physical quantities.\n\nThe provided expression is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nTo solve this, we can analyze the components of the formula:\n\n*   **Coupling Constants:** The terms `alpha^3` and `g^2` represent the coupling strengths of the interactions in the theory. The powers indicate how many vertices of each type are present in the diagram.\n*   **Numerical Factors:** `sqrt(2)` and `8` are numerical constants that arise from the specific details of the calculation, such as group theory factors or symmetry considerations.\n*   **Energy Scale Ratio:** `(Q/M)^2` is a ratio of two energy scales, typical in effective field theories or when dealing with particles of different masses.\n*   **The Loop Factor:** The most crucial term for determining the number of loops is `1/(4pi)^6`. In quantum field theory, calculations involving loop diagrams are performed in four-dimensional spacetime. These loop integrals, when calculated using dimensional regularization, consistently produce a factor of `1/(16pi^2)`, which is equivalent to `1/(4pi)^2`, for each loop in the diagram. This factor arises from the integration over the four-dimensional loop momentum.\n\nWe can establish a direct relationship between the number of loops, denoted by `L`, and the power of the `(4pi)` term in the denominator. The general form of this dependence is `(1/(4pi)^2)^L`.\n\nGiven the term `1/(4pi)^6` in the expression, we can set up the following equation:\n`(1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\nThis simplifies to:\n`1/(4pi)^(2L) = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\nBy comparing the exponents, we find:\n`2L = 6`\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram must have contained three loops. This corresponds to a \"three-loop\" diagram, which is a higher-order correction in the perturbative expansion of the theory.\n\n<<<D>>>"
