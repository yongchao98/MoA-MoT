    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Reactant:** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde has the chemical structure C₆H₅CH=CHCHO. Counting the carbon atoms: 6 in the phenyl ring, 2 in the double bond, and 1 in the aldehyde group, for a total of 9 carbon atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr) is a Grignard reagent which adds one methyl group.\n*   **Reaction:** The methyl group from the Grignard reagent attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde in a nucleophilic addition. This converts the aldehyde group into a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** The resulting product is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol, with the structure C₆H₅CH=CHCH(OH)CH₃.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The original 9 carbons from cinnamaldehyde plus the 1 carbon from the methylmagnesium bromide result in a total of **10 carbon atoms** in product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol, is a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is an oxidizing agent that converts primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones.\n*   **Reaction:** PCC oxidizes the secondary alcohol group in product 1 to a ketone.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (also known as benzylideneacetone), with the structure C₆H₅CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n*   **Carbon Count:** This oxidation reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms. Therefore, product 2 still has **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** (Dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane, also known as dimethyloxosulfonium methylide or the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent, is a sulfur ylide.\n*   **Reaction:** When reacting with α,β-unsaturated ketones, dimethyloxosulfonium methylide preferentially adds to the carbon-carbon double bond (a 1,4-addition or conjugate addition) to form a cyclopropane ring.\n*   **Product 3:** The ylide transfers a methylene group (–CH₂–) to the C=C double bond of product 2, forming a cyclopropane ring. The final structure is (2-acetylcyclopropyl)benzene.\n*   **Carbon Count:** Product 2 contained 10 carbon atoms. The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent adds one carbon atom from the methylene group. Therefore, the final carbon count for product 3 is 10 + 1 = **11 carbon atoms**.\n\nThus, the final product contains 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
