    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Transit Probability:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star is given by the ratio of the stellar radius (`Rₛ`) to the planet's semi-major axis (`a`), especially for circular orbits.\n    *   Probability `P_transit ≈ Rₛ / a`\n\n2.  **Ratio of Probabilities:** We want to compare the transit probability of Planet_1 (`P_transit,1`) with that of Planet_2 (`P_transit,2`). The ratio is:\n    *   `Ratio = P_transit,1 / P_transit,2 = (Rₛ₁ / a₁) / (Rₛ₂ / a₂)`\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information:** The problem states that both host stars have the same radii.\n    *   `Rₛ₁ = Rₛ₂`\n    *   Substituting this into the ratio simplifies it to: `Ratio = a₂ / a₁`\n\n4.  **Applying Kepler's Third Law:** To find the relationship between the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion, which relates the orbital period (`P`) and the semi-major axis (`a`) to the mass of the host star (`Mₛ`).\n    *   `P² / a³ ∝ 1 / Mₛ`\n    *   This can be rearranged to solve for the semi-major axis: `a³ ∝ Mₛ * P²`, or `a ∝ (Mₛ * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We can now express the ratio `a₂ / a₁` in terms of the stellar masses and orbital periods.\n    *   `a₂ / a₁ = [ (Mₛ₂ * P₂²) / (Mₛ₁ * P₁²) ]^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Substituting Known Relationships:** From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: `P₂ = 3 * P₁`\n    *   The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2: `Mₛ₁ = 2 * Mₛ₂`\n    *   Substitute these into the equation for the ratio:\n        `a₂ / a₁ = [ (Mₛ₂ * (3 * P₁)² ) / ( (2 * Mₛ₂) * P₁² ) ]^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Simplifying the Expression:**\n    *   `a₂ / a₁ = [ (Mₛ₂ * 9 * P₁²) / (2 * Mₛ₂ * P₁²) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   Cancel the common terms `Mₛ₂` and `P₁²` from the numerator and the denominator:\n        `a₂ / a₁ = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   `a₂ / a₁ ≈ 1.65096`\n\nThe ratio of the transit probabilities (`P_transit,1 / P_transit,2`) is equal to the ratio of the semi-major axes (`a₂ / a₁`), which is approximately 1.65. Therefore, Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability of transiting than Planet_2.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
