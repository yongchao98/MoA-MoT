    "This reaction is a classic example of an elimination-addition mechanism proceeding through a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nSodium amide (NaNH2) is a very strong base that abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2**, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is weaker than the carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond. Therefore, the amide anion (NH₂⁻) will abstract a proton from C-6 more readily than a deuteron from C-2. However, both eliminations are possible and lead to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Path A (Major): Abstraction of H from C-6**\n    *   The amide ion removes the proton from C-6.\n    *   The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C-1.\n    *   This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom remains untouched at position 3 relative to the triple bond. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n2.  **Path B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C-2**\n    *   The amide ion removes the deuteron from C-2.\n    *   The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C-1.\n    *   This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-2. Since the deuterium was removed in this step, the resulting intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\n### Step 2: Addition of Amide to the Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe nucleophilic amide ion (NH₂⁻) then attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. After the initial attack, the resulting anion is protonated by the ammonia solvent to yield the final aniline products.\n\n*   **Attack on non-deuterated benzyne (from Path B):**\n    *   Attack at either carbon of the triple bond (C-1 or C-2) followed by protonation results in the formation of a single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    *   The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6). These two carbons are not equivalent because of the deuterium at C-3.\n    *   **Attack at C-1:** This places the new amino group at C-1. Subsequent protonation adds a hydrogen to C-6. The deuterium remains at C-3. The product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C-6:** This places the new amino group at C-6. Protonation adds a hydrogen to C-1. The deuterium is now at the ortho position (C-2) relative to the amino group. The product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the products from both pathways, we have three distinct possible organic products:\n1.  **Aniline** (from the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n2.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n3.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
