    "Here is an analysis of the situation to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2:\n\n**1. Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. Its value depends on two main factors: the concentration of target particles (number density, *n*) and the effective area for a collision (the collision cross-section, *σ*). The general formula is inversely proportional to these factors: λ ∝ 1/(nσ).\n\n**2. Defining λ1 and λ2**\n\n*   **λ1: MFP of Gas Molecules:** This is the average distance a residual gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. In this case, both the moving particle and the target particle are gas molecules of similar size. The formula for this is approximately **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_mol)**, where *n* is the number density of gas molecules and *σ_mol* is the kinetic cross-section of the molecules (related to their physical size). The √2 factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also in motion.\n*   **λ2: MFP of Electrons:** This is the average distance a beam electron travels before it scatters off a residual gas molecule. Here, the moving particle is a tiny, high-energy electron, and the target is a relatively large, nearly stationary gas molecule. The formula for this is **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e)**, where *n* is the same number density of gas molecules and *σ_e* is the scattering cross-section for an electron-molecule collision.\n\n**3. Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections**\n\nThe crucial difference between λ1 and λ2 lies in their respective collision cross-sections, *σ_mol* and *σ_e*.\n\n*   **Molecule-Molecule Cross-Section (σ_mol):** This is a measure of the physical size of the molecules. A collision occurs when two molecules get close enough for their electron clouds to repel, similar to billiard balls colliding.\n*   **Electron-Molecule Cross-Section (σ_e):** This is determined by the electrostatic interaction between the electron and the molecule. The electron is a point-like particle, and it is scattered by the electric field of the molecule's nucleus and its electron cloud.\n\nFor a high-energy electron (1000 kV), the interaction is weak unless it passes very close to the nucleus or an atomic electron. The electron is moving so fast that the probability of a significant scattering event is much lower than the probability of two large gas molecules \"bumping\" into each other. Consequently, the effective cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule (σ_e) is significantly *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section for a molecule-molecule collision (σ_mol).\n\n**4. Reaching the Conclusion**\n\nLet's compare the formulas:\n*   λ1 ∝ 1 / (√2 * σ_mol)\n*   λ2 ∝ 1 / σ_e\n\nSince we have established that σ_e is significantly smaller than σ_mol, the denominator for λ2 (n * σ_e) will be significantly smaller than the denominator for λ1 (√2 * n * σ_mol).\n\nBecause the mean free path is *inversely* proportional to the denominator, a smaller denominator results in a larger mean free path. Therefore, the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) must be considerably larger than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\nThe options provided are:\nA) λ2 < λ1 (Incorrect)\nB) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, the difference is expected to be more significant)\nC) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect, a difference is expected)\nD) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct, as it states λ2 is larger than λ1 by a noticeable factor)\n\nThe factor of 1.22 is a specific value used to create the inequality, but the underlying physical principle is that λ2 must be greater than λ1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
