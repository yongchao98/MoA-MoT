    "The observations described are characteristic of a peptidic compound existing as a mixture of slowly interconverting isomers. Here is a breakdown of why this is the most probable explanation and how it fits the experimental data:\n\n*   **Restricted Amide Bond Rotation:** Peptides are made of amino acid residues linked by amide (peptide) bonds. Due to the partial double-bond character of the C-N bond, rotation is restricted. This can lead to the existence of both *cis* and *trans* conformers around the amide bond. These different spatial arrangements are known as rotational isomers, or rotamers.\n*   **Formation of Diastereomers:** If the peptide contains at least one other chiral center (which is true for any peptide not made exclusively of glycine or other achiral amino acids), the *cis* and *trans* rotamers are not mirror images of each other. Instead, they are diastereomers. This is also true if an accidental epimerization or use of a racemic starting material occurred during synthesis, which would also result in a mixture of diastereomers.\n*   **Â¹H NMR Spectroscopy:** Diastereomers are distinct chemical species and are expected to have different NMR spectra. The atoms close to the site of isomerism, such as the alpha-proton of an adjacent amino acid, are most affected, leading to separate peaks. It is very common for this to manifest as two peaks of similar chemical shift for the same proton, with the integrals reflecting the population ratio of the two isomers (in this case, \"roughly equal\" suggests a ~1:1 ratio). This is a classic sign of cis/trans isomerism in peptides.\n*   **LC-MS Analysis:** Since diastereomers have different three-dimensional shapes and polarity, they can often be separated by chromatography (LC), resulting in two distinct peaks. Because they are isomers, they have the identical molecular formula and mass, which explains why both LC peaks produce the same mass spectrum consistent with the expected molecule.\n*   **Effect of Temperature:** The energy barrier for rotation between cis and trans isomers can be high enough that the two forms are stable and separable at room temperature and even at the \"elevated temperature\" of the LC-MS experiment. The fact that two clear peaks are still observed means that interconversion is slow on the timescale of the chromatographic separation under those conditions.\n\n### Evaluation of Other Options\n\n*   **B) 'Double coupling':** This would result in a molecule with a higher mass, which is inconsistent with the LC-MS data.\n*   **C) Contamination with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different mass from the final product, which is contradicted by the LC-MS results.\n*   **D) Mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be distinguished by standard NMR or separated by a standard (achiral) LC column. This contradicts both the NMR and LC observations.\n\nTherefore, the presence of two distinct, separable species with the same mass, most evident by the duplication of a single alpha-proton signal in the NMR, points strongly to a mixture of diastereomers. The most common source of such diastereomerism in a synthesized peptide is restricted rotation around an amide bond, leading to cis/trans rotamers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
