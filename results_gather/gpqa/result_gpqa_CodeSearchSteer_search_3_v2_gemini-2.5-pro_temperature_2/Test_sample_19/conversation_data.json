    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations simplifies a complex interaction with a nucleus by treating it as an interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon. This approximation rests on a set of core assumptions about the nature of the interaction and the nuclear environment.\n\nThe key assumptions that collectively imply the impulse approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is the foundational principle of the impulse approximation. Instead of a complicated many-body problem, the interaction is reduced to a sum of interactions with each nucleon individually. This is sometimes referred to as the \"dilution assumption\".\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption, often called the \"transparency assumption,\" posits that the incoming probe interacts with the target nucleon, and both the probe and the struck nucleon can leave the nucleus without significant further interactions with the other nucleons (these are known as final-state interactions). While final-state interactions are a known correction to the impulse approximation, the simplest form of the approximation assumes their absence.\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** The interaction is assumed to happen over a very short timescale, an \"impulse,\" during which the influence of the forces that bind the nucleon within the nucleus is negligible. The nucleon's momentum within the nucleus before the collision is considered, but the binding potential itself is ignored during the brief moment of interaction.\n\nThe third potential assumption provided, \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic,\" is not a standard requirement for the impulse approximation at the nucleon level. The impulse approximation treats nucleons as the fundamental particles of interaction, without delving into their internal quark-gluon structure. While there are relativistic versions of the impulse approximation, they do not hinge on this specific condition regarding quarks.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
