    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\n    We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]`\n    The problem states that the star is the same for both planets (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and that both planets have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n3.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity:**\n    The Doppler shift (`Δλ`) is used to find the radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) of the star. The relationship is `Δλ / λ₀ = K / c`, which means `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ`.\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) induced on a star by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p`\n    (assuming the orbital inclination `i` is ~90°, which is a reasonable assumption given that the planets were also detected via the transit method).\n    The orbital velocity of the planet (`v_p`) is:\n    `v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    Substituting `v_p` into the equation for `K`:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n    This shows that `K` is proportional to `M_p / sqrt(a)`.\n\n4.  **Finding the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:**\n    We can set up a ratio for the two planets:\n    `K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / sqrt(a1)) / (M_p2 / sqrt(a2))`\n    `K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n    We can now solve for `sqrt(a2 / a1)`, which is the temperature ratio we need:\n    `sqrt(a2 / a1) = (K1 / K2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    First, find the ratio `K1 / K2`. Since `K` is proportional to `Δλ`:\n    `K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 0.75`\n    Next, find the ratio `M_p2 / M_p1`:\n    `M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5 / 7`\n    Now, substitute these values back into the equation:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = (0.75) * (5 / 7)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15 / 28`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
