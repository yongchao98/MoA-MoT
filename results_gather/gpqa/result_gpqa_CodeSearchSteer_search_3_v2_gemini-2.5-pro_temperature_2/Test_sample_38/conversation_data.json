    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This condition states that the total probability of finding the particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1.\n\nThe probability of finding the particle at a specific position `x` is given by the square of the modulus of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|². Since we are told the particles are only found in the region between x=1 and x=3, we must integrate the probability density over this interval and set it to 1.\n\nThe wave function is given as:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe squared modulus, |Ψ(x)|², is calculated as the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts:\n|Ψ(x)|² = (Re(Ψ))² + (Im(Ψ))²\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNow, we set up the normalization integral from x=1 to x=3:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can split this into two separate integrals:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\nFirst, let's solve the integral of the first term:\na² * ∫ [from 1 to 3] (1 / (1 + x)) dx\nThe integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|.\n= a² * [ln(1 + x)] (from 1 to 3)\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2))\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² * ln(4/2)\n= a² * ln(2)\n\nNext, solve the integral of the second term:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx\n= [0.25 * x] (from 1 to 3)\n= 0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1\n= 0.75 - 0.25\n= 0.5\n\nNow, substitute these results back into the main equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value of ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.8494\n\nThis value is approximately 0.85.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1.1\nB) 0.6\nC) 0.35\nD) 0.85\n\nThe calculated value of \"a\" is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
