    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a \"bottom-up\" effective field theory, extending the Standard Model with higher-dimensional operators. This construction relies on a set of fundamental assumptions about the underlying symmetries of nature at energies accessible by current experiments.\n\nAll operators within the SMEFT are required to be invariant under the symmetries of Poincaré and CPT, but not necessarily CP. Here is a breakdown of why each symmetry is or is not required to be respected:\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincaré Symmetry:** The SMEFT is built upon the principles of local quantum field theory, which assumes that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion. This is the principle of Lorentz invariance. More broadly, the SMEFT assumes Poincaré invariance, which includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. These symmetries are considered foundational in the construction of the theory's operators.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** CPT (Charge conjugation, Parity, and Time reversal) symmetry is a fundamental property of any Lorentz-invariant local quantum field theory. The CPT theorem states that any such theory is automatically CPT invariant. As the SMEFT is constructed to be a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it inherently respects CPT symmetry. Its violation would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance, which is a foundational assumption of SMEFT.\n\n*   **CP Symmetry:** Unlike CPT, CP (Charge conjugation and Parity) symmetry is not assumed to be a fundamental symmetry that all SMEFT operators must respect. The Standard Model itself contains sources of CP violation. A significant motivation for the SMEFT is to provide a model-independent way to search for new physics, including new sources of CP violation that could explain phenomena like the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Therefore, the SMEFT framework explicitly allows for CP-violating operators.\n\nIn summary, Lorentz, Poincaré, and CPT symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT, while CP symmetry is not a required symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
