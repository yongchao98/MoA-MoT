    "The question asks which of the listed physical theories does not require regularization at high energies. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle infinite or \"divergent\" results that appear in calculations, particularly those involving high energies (or, equivalently, very short distances).\n\n*   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** is the quantum theory of the interaction between light and matter. It was the first quantum field theory to encounter the problem of infinities in calculations. These divergences, which arise in loop diagrams, necessitate the use of regularization and subsequent renormalization to yield finite, physical predictions.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force, which binds quarks and gluons. Much like QED, calculations in QCD that go beyond the simplest approximations result in high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences. Therefore, QCD requires a regularization procedure, such as lattice regularization or dimensional regularization, to make sense of these infinities.\n\n*   **C) Classical Electrodynamics** is a classical theory and thus lacks the quantum loop diagrams that are the primary source of high-energy divergences in QED and QCD. However, it is not entirely free from infinity-related problems. The theory predicts that a point-like charged particle, like an electron, would have an infinite amount of energy stored in its electric field, known as infinite self-energy. This is a high-energy/short-distance problem inherent to the theory that is sometimes addressed by introducing a finite radius for the particle, a process that can be seen as a form of regularization.\n\n*   **A) Superstring Theory** is a candidate for a unified theory of quantum mechanics and general relativity. A central feature and primary motivation for the theory is that it is believed to be free of the high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences that plague other quantum field theories. The theory posits that fundamental particles are not point-like, but rather one-dimensional \"strings.\" This extended nature smooths out the point-like interactions that lead to infinities in other theories. As a result, Superstring Theory is thought to be \"UV finite,\" meaning it does not require regularization for high-energy calculations.\n\nBased on this analysis, Quantum Electrodynamics and Quantum Chromodynamics definitively require regularization. Classical Electrodynamics has a self-energy problem that can be seen as requiring a form of regularization. Superstring Theory, by its very design, is intended to be free from these high-energy divergences and thus does not require regularization.\n\n<<<A>>>"
