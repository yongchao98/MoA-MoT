    "To determine the correct option, we will follow these two main steps:\n1.  Calculate the amplitude of the photometric variation caused by the spotted stellar hemisphere.\n2.  Calculate the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce a transit signal of the same amplitude.\n\n### Step 1: Amplitude of the Starspot Signal\n\nThe variation in the star's brightness is due to its rotation, which alternately reveals a hemisphere without spots and a hemisphere partially covered by them. The maximum flux (F_max) is observed when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The minimum flux (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n\nThe flux from a stellar surface is dictated by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (T_eff⁴). We have:\n*   Effective temperature of the star, T_star = 6000 K\n*   Temperature of the spots, T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere, f = 20% = 0.20\n\nThe maximum flux (from the unspotted hemisphere) is proportional to the temperature of the star raised to the fourth power:\n*   F_max ∝ T_star⁴ = 6000⁴\n\nThe minimum flux (from the spotted hemisphere) is a combination of the flux from the unspotted portion (80% of the area) and the spotted portion (20% of the area):\n*   F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n*   F_min ∝ 0.80 * 6000⁴ + 0.20 * 5000⁴\n\nThe amplitude of this rotational modulation signal is the relative change in flux:\n*   Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\n*   Amplitude = (T_star⁴ - [0.80 * T_star⁴ + 0.20 * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴\n*   Amplitude = 1 - 0.80 - 0.20 * (T_spot / T_star)⁴\n*   Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\n*   Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n*   Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]\n*   Amplitude = 0.20 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the starspots cause a brightness variation with an amplitude of approximately 10.36%.\n\n### Step 2: Equivalent Exoplanet Transit Signal\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its host star, it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this transit, which corresponds to the amplitude of the signal, is the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the planet to the cross-sectional area of the star. This is given by the formula:\n*   Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nWhere R_pl is the radius of the planet and R_star is the radius of the star.\n\nTo produce the same amplitude as the starspots, the transit depth must equal the calculated amplitude of 0.10355.\n*   (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\n*   R_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n*   R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet most closely matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
