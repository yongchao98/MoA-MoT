    "This problem describes a multi-step organic chemistry synthesis followed by structural analysis using NMR spectroscopy. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants\n\n1.  **The Anhydride**: A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating all its protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n    *   This spectroscopic data is a perfect match for **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent vinyl protons (explaining the single ¹H peak) and two types of equivalent carbons (two alkene and two carbonyl carbons, explaining the two ¹³C peaks). The chemical shifts are characteristic for this compound.\n\n2.  **The Diene**: The anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated system and a CH₂ group at the 5th position.\n\n### Step 2: The Reaction and Its Products\n\nThe reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct. The formation of two products, a major and a minor one, points to the creation of two different stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n\n*   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored and therefore the major product. The *exo* product is usually more thermodynamically stable but forms more slowly, making it the minor product.\n*   The molecular formula of the products is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is consistent with the sum of the atoms from the diene (C₉H₁₄) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n### Step 3: Structure of the Endo and Exo Products\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the two product isomers. The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n\n*   **Structure**: The product has a norbornene skeleton.\n    *   The bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) each have a methyl group.\n    *   The double bond (at C2, C3) has two methyl groups.\n    *   The C7 bridge is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused at C5 and C6. Due to the cis-nature of maleic anhydride, this fusion is also cis. The two protons on C5 and C6 (let's call them H-fuse) are on the same side of the anhydride ring.\n*   ***Endo* Isomer (Major Product)**: The anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-CH₂ bridge and away from the C2=C3 bridge.\n*   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor Product)**: The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7-CH₂ bridge and on the same side as the C2=C3 bridge.\n\n### Step 4: NOESY NMR Analysis\n\nA 2D NOESY NMR experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the major product (*endo*) but far apart in the minor product (*exo*).\n\nLet's first assign the proton signals mentioned in the options:\n*   **A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: These are the two equivalent H-fuse protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule.\n*   **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n*   **A 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons.\n*   **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons of the C7-CH₂ bridge. (The other proton would be a separate doublet).\n\nNow, let's analyze the spatial proximities in each isomer:\n\n*   **In the Major (*Endo*) Product**:\n    *   The H-fuse protons (~3.5 ppm) are on the same side as the CH₂ bridge. One of the CH₂ protons (the one designated *anti* to the double bond, ~1.5 ppm) points directly towards these H-fuse protons. This close proximity will result in a **strong NOESY cross-peak**.\n    *   The vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) are on the opposite side of the H-fuse protons. They are too far away for an NOE interaction.\n\n*   **In the Minor (*Exo*) Product**:\n    *   The H-fuse protons (~3.5 ppm) are on the opposite side of the CH₂ bridge. They are far from the CH₂ protons (~1.5 ppm), so **no NOESY cross-peak** is expected between them.\n    *   The vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) are on the same side as the H-fuse protons. A strong NOE interaction would be expected between them.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe problem states that the differentiating cross-peak is **present in the major product** and absent in the minor product. Based on our analysis, the NOE interaction between the H-fuse protons and a proton on the CH₂ bridge is strong in the major (*endo*) isomer and absent in the minor (*exo*) isomer.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the resonances of these two groups:\n*   **A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H-fuse protons).\n*   **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (one of the C7 bridge protons).\n\nThis corresponds exactly to option B. This specific use of NOESY to distinguish between endo and exo isomers in Diels-Alder adducts is a standard technique in structure elucidation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
