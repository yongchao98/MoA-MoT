    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, Ca²⁺, in a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation constant (K_f) for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5 x 10¹⁰.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented by the following equilibrium:\n\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant, K_f, for this reaction is:\n\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻])\n\nSince we are starting with the Ca-EDTA complex and want to find the concentration of free calcium ions, we need to consider the dissociation of the complex:\n\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe dissociation constant, K_d, is the inverse of the formation constant:\n\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nNow, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d:\n\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nSince the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant is very small. This means that the complex will not dissociate much, and 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = 2 x 10⁻⁶⁵ M\n\nHowever, we need to re-examine the approximation. It seems there's a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's re-calculate.\n\nx² = (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (2 x 10⁻²) = 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴) = √40 x 10⁻⁷ ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1.0x10⁻² M\nB) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nC) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 2.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
