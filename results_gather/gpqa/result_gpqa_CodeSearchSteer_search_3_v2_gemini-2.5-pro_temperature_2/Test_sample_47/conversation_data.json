    "The multi-step synthesis unfolds as follows, leading to the final product whose hydrogen environments need to be analyzed.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine.**\n    This reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom, yielding product 1, 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide.**\n    When an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with a strong base such as sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a classic ring-contraction reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. The reaction proceeds through a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then opens to form a more stable carboxylate salt. Subsequent acidification (a standard workup step, though not explicitly mentioned) yields a carboxylic acid with a smaller ring. Thus, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form product 2, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine.**\n    Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (product 2) reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) in a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl produced. This reaction forms product 3, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. This reagent is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) due to the bulky tert-butoxy groups. Therefore, it selectively reduces cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (product 3) to the final product 4, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must examine its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). A plane of symmetry passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the rest of the ring.\n\nThis symmetry results in the following distinct hydrogen environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment.\n2.  **The proton on C1:** The hydrogen on the carbon of the ring bonded to the aldehyde group is also unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry.\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is cis to the aldehyde group, one is trans), meaning they are not equivalent to each other. The symmetry plane makes the \"cis\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C5, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the corresponding protons on C3 and C4 equivalent. This gives another two distinct sets of protons.\n\nCounting these up, we have:\n*   1 type of aldehyde proton.\n*   1 type of proton on C1.\n*   2 types of protons on the C2/C5 pair.\n*   2 types of protons on the C3/C4 pair.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
