    "To identify the unknown organic compound, we will analyze the provided 1H NMR data and compare it with the expected spectra of the four possible choices.\n\n### 1H NMR Data Analysis:\n\nThe experimental data is as follows:\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet peak integrating to three protons is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) that is not adjacent to any other protons. This is a classic signal for the acetyl methyl group (CH₃-C=O) in an acetate ester. All four candidate molecules contain this group, so this signal is consistent with all options.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is in the vinyl proton region (alkene). It's a single proton that appears as a doublet, meaning it is coupled to one other proton. The chemical shift of 7.0 ppm is significantly downfield, suggesting the proton is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an oxygen atom (an enol acetate system).\n*   **J = 16.0 Hz:** The coupling constant (J) between the two vinyl protons provides crucial information about their stereochemistry. For protons on a double bond (vicinal coupling):\n    *   A *trans* configuration typically shows a J-value between 12-18 Hz.\n    *   A *cis* configuration typically shows a J-value between 6-12 Hz.\n    The observed value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a **trans** configuration. This finding allows us to eliminate the *cis* isomers: Cis-propenyl acetate and Cis-butenyl acetate.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is another vinyl proton. The multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq), meaning it is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet) and a set of three protons (giving the quartet). This is consistent with a proton that is on a double bond and adjacent to both another vinyl proton and a methyl group.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to three protons and appears as a doublet. This is indicative of a methyl group (CH₃) coupled to a single proton.\n\n### Evaluating the Remaining Options:\n\nBased on the *trans* configuration (J=16.0 Hz), we are left with two possibilities:\n\n**A) Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n*   **Structure:** CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)CH₃\n*   Let's predict its 1H NMR spectrum:\n    *   **Acetate methyl (CH₃-C=O):** A singlet around 2.1 ppm. This matches the data.\n    *   **Vinyl protons (-CH=CH-):**\n        *   The proton attached to the oxygen (-CH-O) would be a doublet, coupled to the other vinyl proton. Its chemical shift would be downfield due to the deshielding effect of the oxygen. This matches the signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d)**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton (-CH=) is coupled to the first vinyl proton (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (giving a quartet). The resulting signal would be a doublet of quartets (dq). This matches the signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**.\n    *   **Terminal methyl (CH₃-CH=):** This methyl group is coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This perfectly matches the signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The structure of Trans-propenyl acetate is an excellent match for the entire set of 1H NMR data.\n\n**D) Trans-butenyl acetate:**\n*   Let's assume the most analogous structure, **trans-but-1-enyl acetate:** CH₃CH₂-CH=CH-O-C(=O)CH₃\n*   Let's predict its 1H NMR spectrum:\n    *   **Acetate methyl:** A singlet around 2.1 ppm. (Matches)\n    *   **Vinyl protons:** There would still be two vinyl protons in a *trans* configuration. One would be a doublet. The other would be coupled to the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the adjacent methylene (CH₂) group (triplet), resulting in a doublet of triplets (dt), not a dq. (Mismatch)\n    *   **Ethyl group (CH₃CH₂-):** The spectrum should contain signals for an ethyl group: a quartet for the CH₂ protons and a triplet for the terminal CH₃ protons. The provided data shows a methyl *doublet* at 1.6 ppm, not an ethyl group's signals. (Mismatch)\n\n### Final Identification\n\nThe provided 1H NMR data—specifically the singlet at 2.1 ppm, the trans-coupled vinyl doublet at 7.0 ppm, the doublet of quartets at 5.5 ppm, and the methyl doublet at 1.6 ppm—is uniquely and perfectly consistent with the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
