    "The user wants me to identify the correct reagents for two separate organic reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n\n*   This reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n*   The first step is the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (from NaCN) on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n*   The second step is the protonation of the negatively charged alkoxide ion to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin.\n*   Reagent A must therefore be a proton source. Looking at the options, H3O+ (hydronium ion, representing an acidic workup) is a standard reagent for this protonation step. NaHSO3 is incorrect as it would form a bisulfite addition product, not facilitate cyanohydrin formation.\n\n**Reaction 2:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n\n*   This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The starting material is a cyanohydrin.\n*   The hydrolysis of nitriles can be catalyzed by either acid or base.\n*   The reaction with water alone is very slow.\n*   The reaction is typically carried out by heating the nitrile with a dilute acid, like hydrochloric acid (HCl), or a base like sodium hydroxide.\n*   If a base is used, the salt of the carboxylic acid is formed first, and a separate acidification step is needed to get the free carboxylic acid.\n*   If a strong acid like HCl (Reagent B) is used with water, it directly hydrolyzes the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.\n*   Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid and would not be as effective as a strong mineral acid like HCl for this hydrolysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Reagent A is H3O+ for the acidic workup in the cyanohydrin formation.\n*   Reagent B is HCl to catalyze the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n*   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
