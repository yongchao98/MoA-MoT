    "To determine the correct starting materials, a detailed analysis of the two reactions is required, focusing on the selectivity of the reducing agents.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe general structure of the starting materials provided in the options is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester) called 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This lactone is formed when one of the carboxyl groups (either the acid or the ester) is reduced to a primary alcohol, which then cyclizes by reacting with the remaining carboxyl group.\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃).\n\n**Reaction 1: Reduction with Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\nLithium borohydride is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. While it can reduce carboxylic acids, the reaction is significantly slower. Therefore, LiBH₄ will preferentially reduce the isobutyl ester group of compound A to a primary alcohol.\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** The ester group `(-COO-isobutyl)` is reduced to a primary alcohol `(-CH₂OH)`.\n2.  **Intermediate:** This forms a hydroxy acid: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The alcohol group then attacks the carboxylic acid group, forming the six-membered lactone ring and releasing a molecule of water.\n\nThroughout this process, the chiral center at the carbon with the ethyl group is not involved in the reaction, and its stereochemistry is preserved. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\nTherefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Reduction with Borane (BH₃)**\n\n*   **B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\nBorane is a well-established reagent that is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Borane reacts much faster with carboxylic acids than with esters.\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** The carboxylic acid group `(-COOH)` is reduced to a primary alcohol `(-CH₂OH)`.\n2.  **Intermediate:** This forms a hydroxy ester: `IsoBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The alcohol group then attacks the ester carbonyl in a transesterification reaction, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n\nSimilar to the first reaction, the stereocenter is unaffected. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nTherefore, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the selective reactivity of the reducing agents:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
