    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step. The target molecule has three substituents—acetyl, bromo, and nitro—in a 1,3,5-relationship (meta to each other). This substitution pattern is key to devising the synthesis strategy.\n\nA direct approach of introducing the groups onto the benzene ring is challenging. For example, starting with acetophenone (product of Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene), the acetyl group is meta-directing. Nitration would yield 3-nitroacetophenone. However, the subsequent bromination would be difficult as the ring is now heavily deactivated by two meta-directing groups. Achieving a high yield would be improbable.\n\nA more effective strategy often involves using a powerful directing group that can be modified or removed later. The amino group (-NH₂) is a strong ortho-, para-director. Its presence can be leveraged, and then it can be removed via diazotization and reduction (deamination).\n\nLet's analyze the proposed option:\n\n**Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃)**\nBenzene is treated with acetyl chloride and aluminum chloride to form acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a meta-director.\n*   Product: Acetophenone\n\n**Step ii: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄)**\nAcetophenone is nitrated. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the meta-position.\n*   Product: 3-Nitroacetophenone\n\n**Step iii: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃)**\nNow, the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at position 1 and a nitro group at position 3. Both are meta-directors and deactivating. However, the acetyl group directs to position 5, and the nitro group also directs to position 5 (meta to itself). Since both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) to the same carbon, this step proceeds with good regioselectivity. Although the ring is deactivated, bromination is still feasible.\n*   Product: 3-Bromo-5-nitroacetophenone\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe three-step sequence of acylation, followed by nitration, and then bromination, is the most logical and high-yield pathway to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. At each electrophilic substitution step, the existing substituents cooperatively direct the incoming group to the desired position. This sequence is not explicitly listed as one of the multi-step options A, B, C, or D in its simple three-step form. The provided options appear to be unnecessarily complex, with steps that are either chemically incorrect (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on a heavily deactivated ring), inefficient (e.g., synthesis and immediate removal of the only functional group), or lead to incorrect isomers. Based on standard organic synthesis principles for achieving a 1,3,5-substitution pattern with these specific groups, a sequence beginning with Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by nitration, and then bromination is the chemically sound method.\n\n<<<C) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Br2/FeBr3>>>"
