    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two different energy levels changes, we can use the Boltzmann equation. This equation describes the distribution of atoms among various energy states at a specific temperature, assuming the system is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms (N) in a higher energy level (level 2) to a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   **g₁ and g₂** are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of level 1 and level 2, respectively.\n*   **ΔE** is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   **k** is the Boltzmann constant, which has a value of approximately 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K.\n*   **T** is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem provides the temperatures for two scenarios: a star without dark spots and a star with 40% of its surface covered by spots.\n\n*   **Temperature without spots (T_unspotted):** 6000 K\n*   **Temperature with spots (T_spotted):** 5500 K\n\nThe transition between the energy levels corresponds to a wavelength (λ) of approximately 1448 Å. We can calculate the energy difference (ΔE) using the formula E = hc/λ, where 'h' is Planck's constant (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) and 'c' is the speed of light (3 × 10⁸ m/s).\n\nFirst, we convert the wavelength from angstroms to meters:\n1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nNext, we calculate the energy difference ΔE:\nΔE = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s × 3 × 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m) ≈ 1.372 × 10⁻¹⁸ J\n\nNow, we can set up the ratios for both scenarios:\n\n*   **Ratio without spots (Ratio_unspotted):** (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * 6000 K))\n*   **Ratio with spots (Ratio_spotted):** (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * 5500 K))\n\nTo find the factor by which this ratio changes, we divide the ratio for the unspotted star by the ratio for the spotted star. The term for the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancels out.\n\nFactor = [exp(-ΔE / (k * 6000))] / [exp(-ΔE / (k * 5500))]\nFactor = exp[(-ΔE/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500)]\n\nNow we plug in the values for ΔE and k:\nΔE/k ≈ (1.372 × 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99373.6 K\n\nFactor = exp[-99373.6 K * (1/6000 K⁻¹ - 1/5500 K⁻¹)]\nFactor = exp[-99373.6 * (-1.515 × 10⁻⁵)]\nFactor = exp[1.5057]\nFactor ≈ 4.507\n\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5. This aligns with the observation that the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots, as a lower temperature leads to a smaller population in the higher energy level.\n\n<<<A>>>"
