    "The search results confirm the standard approach to the relativistic harmonic oscillator. The total energy is given by `E = γmc^2 + (1/2)kx^2`, where `γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`. The principle of conservation of energy is the correct method to solve this problem.\n\nMy step-by-step derivation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define Total Energy**: The total energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy:\n    *   E = γmc² + U(x)\n    *   where `γ` is the Lorentz factor `1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, `m` is the rest mass, `c` is the speed of light, and `U(x)` is the potential energy, `(1/2)kx²`.\n    *   So, `E = (mc²) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) + (1/2)kx²`.\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**: At the maximum displacement, `x = A`, the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so its velocity `v` is 0.\n    *   At this point, the Lorentz factor `γ` is 1 (since `v=0`).\n    *   The total energy of the system is `E = mc² + (1/2)kA²`. Since the system is conservative, this total energy remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n3.  **Energy at Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**: At the equilibrium position, `x = 0`, the potential energy `U(0)` is 0. The speed of the oscillator is at its maximum, `v = v_max`.\n    *   The total energy at this point is purely kinetic (in the relativistic sense): `E = γ_max * mc² = (mc²) / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy**: Equate the total energy at the two points.\n    *   `Energy at x = A` = `Energy at x = 0`\n    *   `mc² + (1/2)kA² = (mc²) / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Solve for v_max**: Rearrange the equation to isolate `v_max`.\n    *   First, solve for the term containing `v_max`:\n        `1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = (mc² + (1/2)kA²) / mc²`\n        `1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        `sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))`\n    *   Square both sides:\n        `1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `v_max²/c²`:\n        `v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n    *   Finally, solve for `v_max`:\n        `v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + kA²/(2mc²))²)`\n\nThis result matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
