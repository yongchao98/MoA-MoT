    "The reaction sequence unfolds as follows:\n*   **Compound A** is Propene (C3H6).\n*   Propene undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to yield **Compound B**, which is 1,2-dibromopropane.\n*   **Compound B** reacts with alcoholic KOH in a dehydrohalogenation reaction to form **Compound C**, which is Propyne.\n*   Passing **Compound C** (Propyne) through a red-hot iron tube results in cyclotrimerization, producing **Compound D**, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene).\n*   **Compound D** reacts with a nitrating mixture (conc. HNO3 + conc. H2SO4) to form **Compound E**, which is 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene.\n*   **Compound E** is reduced with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form **Compound F**, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine).\n*   **Compound F** reacts with nitrous acid to form **Compound G**, the corresponding diazonium salt (2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride).\n*   **Compound G** reacts with sodium hydroxide to form **Compound H**, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.** Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are well-known precursors for azo dyes. Specifically, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline is used to produce dyes like Acid Blue 129. Thus, this statement is correct.\n*   **B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.** Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Due to the molecule's symmetry, the three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and will produce one singlet. The nine protons of the three methyl groups are also chemically equivalent and will produce another singlet. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n*   **C) C is a flammable gas.** Compound C is propyne. It is a colorless, highly flammable gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, with a boiling point of -23.1Â°C. This statement is correct.\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.** Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is used to detect the presence of phenols. A positive test is indicated by the formation of a red, blue, green, or purple coloration. A yellow color is not a characteristic positive result for this test. While many phenols give a colored complex, some, particularly sterically hindered ones like 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, may not give a color change or a typical positive result. However, the definitive positive result is a distinct color change to purple, green, or blue, not yellow. Hence, this statement is incorrect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
