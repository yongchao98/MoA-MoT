    "To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we will use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. This formula relates the entropy of a black hole to the area of its event horizon. The steps to solve this problem are as follows:\n\n1.  **Convert the given distance and angular size into SI units.**\n    The distance to the galaxy is given as `d = 10^10 parsecs`. We need to convert this to meters. One parsec is approximately `3.086 x 10^16` meters.\n    The angular size of the event horizon is given as `θ = 10^-17` degrees. This needs to be converted into radians for use in the small-angle formula.\n\n2.  **Calculate the radius of the black hole's event horizon.**\n    The physical diameter of the event horizon (`D`) can be found using the small-angle formula: `D = d * θ`, where `θ` is in radians. The radius (`R_s`, the Schwarzschild radius) is half of the diameter.\n\n3.  **Calculate the area of the event horizon.**\n    Assuming the black hole is non-rotating (a Schwarzschild black hole), its event horizon is a sphere. The area (`A`) is given by the formula for the surface area of a sphere, `A = 4 * π * R_s^2`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the entropy of the black hole.**\n    The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (`S`) is given by the formula: `S = (k_B * c^3 * A) / (4 * G * ħ)`, where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `c` is the speed of light, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nHere are the detailed calculations:\n\n**Step 1: Unit Conversions**\n\n*   Distance `d = 10^10 pc * (3.086 * 10^16 m/pc) = 3.086 * 10^26 m`\n*   Angular size `θ = 10^-17 degrees * (π / 180) radians/degree ≈ 1.745 * 10^-19 radians`\n\n**Step 2: Radius of the Event Horizon**\n\n*   Diameter `D = d * θ = (3.086 * 10^26 m) * (1.745 * 10^-19) ≈ 5.385 * 10^7 m`\n*   Radius `R_s = D / 2 ≈ 2.693 * 10^7 m`\n\n**Step 3: Area of the Event Horizon**\n\n*   Area `A = 4 * π * R_s^2 = 4 * π * (2.693 * 10^7 m)^2 ≈ 9.11 * 10^15 m^2`\n\n**Step 4: Entropy Calculation**\n\nUsing the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:\n`S = (k_B * c^3 * A) / (4 * G * ħ)`\n\nWith the following constants:\n*   `k_B ≈ 1.38 * 10^-23 J/K`\n*   `c ≈ 3.00 * 10^8 m/s`\n*   `G ≈ 6.674 * 10^-11 N m^2/kg^2`\n*   `ħ ≈ 1.055 * 10^-34 J s`\n\n`S ≈ [(1.38 * 10^-23) * (3.00 * 10^8)^3 * (9.11 * 10^15)] / [4 * (6.674 * 10^-11) * (1.055 * 10^-34)]`\n`S ≈ [ (1.38 * 10^-23) * (2.7 * 10^25) * (9.11 * 10^15) ] / [ 2.815 * 10^-44 ]`\n`S ≈ ( 3.39 * 10^18 ) / ( 2.815 * 10^-44 )`\n`S ≈ 1.20 * 10^62 J/K`\n\nThe calculated entropy is approximately `1.20 x 10^62 J/K`, so the order of magnitude is 10^62 J/K. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
