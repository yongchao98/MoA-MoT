    "The calculation for the expectation value of the given operator has been performed and confirmed. The final numerical result matches one of the provided options when rounded to one decimal place. Therefore, the information is sufficient to answer the question.\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nThe operator for which the expectation value needs to be calculated is:\nO = 10σ_z + 5σ_x\n\nThe expectation value ⟨O⟩ is calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, which can be expanded as:\n⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ⟩ = 10⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ + 5⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the expectation value of σ_z. The operator σ_z has the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ states as its eigenstates with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.\n*   `σ_z|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩`\n*   `σ_z|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩`\n\nThe expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the squared magnitude of the corresponding amplitudes in the state |ψ⟩:\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = (+1) * |0.5|^2 + (-1) * |(√3)/2|^2 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value of σ_x. The Pauli matrix for σ_x in the |↑⟩, |↓⟩ basis is:\n`σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nIt acts on the basis states as:\n*   `σ_x|↑⟩ = |↓⟩`\n*   `σ_x|↓⟩ = |↑⟩`\n\nThe expectation value `⟨σ_x⟩` is calculated as follows:\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) σ_x (0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩)`\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) (0.5|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩)`\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = 0.5 * (√3)/2 * ⟨↑|↑⟩ + 0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑|↓⟩ + (√3)/2 * (√3)/2 * ⟨↓|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 * 0.5 * ⟨↓|↓⟩`\nSince `⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1`, `⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1`, and `⟨↑|↓⟩ = ⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0`, this simplifies to:\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = (2√3)/4 = (√3)/2`\n\nNow, we can find the total expectation value of the operator O:\n`⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3`\n\nUsing the approximate value of `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * 1.732 = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67`\n\nRounding the result to one decimal place gives -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
