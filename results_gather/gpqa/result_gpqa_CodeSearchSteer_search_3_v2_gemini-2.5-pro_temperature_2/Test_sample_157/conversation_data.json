    "A dominant-negative mutation is one where the mutant protein not only loses its own function but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein from the other allele. In this scenario, the transcription factor must dimerize to become active.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the molecular events with mutation Y:\n1.  **Dimerization is Key:** The wild-type (WT) protein needs to form a WT-WT dimer to function.\n2.  **Mutant Interference:** The protein from mutation Y (Y-protein), although faulty, can still interact with WT proteins because its dimerization domain is what's affected, not necessarily abolished. It forms non-functional heterodimers (WT-Y).\n3.  **\"Poisoning\" the Complex:** The formation of這些 WT-Y heterodimers effectively sequesters the functional WT proteins, preventing them from forming enough active WT-WT dimers. This interference is the essence of the dominant-negative effect.\n4.  **Loss of Function and Degradation:** The resulting non-functional WT-Y heterodimers are often unstable. Cellular quality control mechanisms recognize these improperly formed complexes and target them for degradation by the proteasome. This process not only removes the mutant Y protein but also leads to the degradation of the functional WT protein that is bound to it. This causes a more severe reduction in the total amount of functional protein than simple haploinsufficiency would, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype even in a heterozygous state. Studies of patient variants in the *NF1* gene show that certain missense mutations cause protein instability and exert a dominant-negative effect by destabilizing the wild-type protein through dimerization, targeting it for degradation.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n*   **A) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. The mutation is defined as \"dominant-negative,\" which results in a loss of function.\n*   **B) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While protein aggregation can cause loss-of-function, it's not the primary or most direct mechanism of a dominant-negative mutation acting through dimerization. The formation of non-functional heterodimers is the key disruptive event.\n*   **C) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative effect requires the mutant protein to interact with (dimerize with) the wild-type protein. If it couldn't dimerize at all, it would likely be a recessive mutation, and the heterozygous phenotype would be wild-type.\n*   **D) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most accurate description. The mutant protein forms a complex with the wild-type protein, leading to the degradation of both and thus a functional loss of the wild-type allele's product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
