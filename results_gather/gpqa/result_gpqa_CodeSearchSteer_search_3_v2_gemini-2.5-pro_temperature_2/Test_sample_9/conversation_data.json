    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to compare the four options based on our understanding of planetary physics.\n\n*   **Planet (a)** is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. This is our baseline, with Earth's average density being approximately 5.51 g/cm続.\n*   **Planet (b)** is described as having 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5 g/cm続.\n*   **Planet (d)** has the same composition as Earth but only half the mass. A celestial body's own gravity compresses it. This planet, being less massive than Earth, would experience weaker gravitational compression, resulting in a density lower than Earth's.\n*   **Planet (c)** also shares Earth's composition but is five times more massive. The significantly larger mass leads to much stronger self-gravity. This powerful gravitational force compresses the planet's material, causing it to become much denser. Therefore, its density will be significantly higher than Earth's.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy comparing the scenarios, we can establish a clear order of density:\n1.  **Planet (c)** will be the densest due to its high mass causing strong gravitational compression.\n2.  **Planet (a)** has the standard density of Earth (~5.51 g/cm続).\n3.  **Planet (b)** has a density given as ~5.5 g/cm続, which is slightly less than Earth's.\n4.  **Planet (d)** will be the least dense because its lower mass results in less gravitational compression.\n\nThus, the planet with five times the mass of Earth and the same composition will have the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>"
