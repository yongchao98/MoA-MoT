    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the situation based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. As a result, a total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). To maintain this overall neutrality, since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner cavity wall, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor isolates the region outside from the configuration inside. The electric field inside the body of the conductor is zero. This means the arrangement of the charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` inside the conductor creates no electric field outside the cavity. Consequently, the electric field at point P outside the sphere is produced *only* by the charge residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Field of a Spherical Conductor:** A key principle of electrostatics is that the net charge on a spherical conductor distributes itself uniformly over its outer surface. The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell, at any point outside the shell, is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The point P is located at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the electric field at P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` placed at the conductor's center.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe positions and dimensions related to the cavity (r, s, l, Î¸) are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n<<<B>>>"
