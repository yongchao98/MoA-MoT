    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Its mass is M.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Spontaneous Fission:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments, let's call their rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`. Let `m₁` be the more massive fragment.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    *   The fragments are moving, carrying kinetic energies `T₁` and `T₂`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the fragment masses:\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in terms of the initial energy:\n*   **More massive fragment (m₁):** `m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Less massive fragment (m₂):** `m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Energy to Find Total Kinetic Energy\n\nThe total energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value of the fission) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Initial Rest Energy) - (Final Rest Energy)`\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T_classical = p²/2m`, where `p` is momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n    `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`\n*   From `p² = 2m * T_classical`, we have:\n    `2m₁ * T₁_classical = 2m₂ * T₂_classical`\n    `m₁ * T₁_classical = m₂ * T₂_classical`\n*   This gives a ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = (0.33M) / (0.66M) = 1/2`\n    So, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy:\n    `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nFor the relativistic case, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²`.\nThe total energy is also `E = T + mc²`.\n\n*   Rearranging the energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n*   Substituting `E = T + mc²`: `(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Again, `|p₁| = |p₂|`, so `p₁² = p₂²`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n*   We know `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`, and we have the rest-mass energies `m₁c² = 198 GeV` and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values into the equation:\n    `T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (6 - 2T₁) * 99`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + T₁² + 594 - 198T₁`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. Now, group the `T₁` terms:\n    `396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 6T₁ + 198T₁ = 9 + 594`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference is between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁` - `T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer from GeV to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
