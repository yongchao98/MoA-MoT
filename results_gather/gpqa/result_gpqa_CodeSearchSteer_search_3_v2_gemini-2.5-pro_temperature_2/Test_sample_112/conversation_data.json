    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. This broadness is caused by the strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, carboxylic acids show an intense C=O stretch between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The presence of a broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly indicates a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms, which eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ confirms the presence of a C=C double bond.\n\n### **2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Vinyl-hydrogens:** The problem states that the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. These are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond and typically appear in the 4.5-6.0 ppm region of the spectrum. This observation confirms the existence of an alkene group, which is consistent with the FTIR data.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the carboxonium ion, [COOH]⁺. The presence of this fragment provides strong corroborating evidence for the carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### **4. Determining the Correct Formula using Degrees of Unsaturation**\n\nThe spectral data have established that the molecule is a carboxylic acid (containing one C=O double bond) and also contains a C=C double bond. Each double bond and each ring in a molecule corresponds to one degree of unsaturation (DoU). Therefore, our molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O and one for the C=C.\n\nLet's calculate the Degrees of Unsaturation for the two remaining options:\n\n*   The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n\n*   **For C) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    *   This formula allows for only one degree of unsaturation. This could be either a C=O or a C=C, but not both.\n\n*   **For D) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    *   This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches our findings: one for the carbonyl (C=O) of the carboxylic acid and one for the alkene (C=C).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the combined evidence from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry, the unknown compound contains a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group, requiring two degrees of unsaturation. Only the chemical formula C6H10O2 is consistent with all the provided data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
