    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n### Step 1: Nitration of Toluene\nToluene is treated with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the major product is the para-substituted isomer.\n*   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene\n\n### Step 2: Oxidation of Product 1\nProduct 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This combination of reagents acts as an oxidizing agent. While strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ would convert the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, the conditions described here can lead to the oxidation of the benzylic methyl group to an aldehyde. A known process involves the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene to p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzaldehyde\n\n### Step 3: Condensation Reaction to form Product 3\nProduct 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone (CH₃COCH₃) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, because it involves an aldehyde without α-hydrogens (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) reacting with a ketone that has α-hydrogens (acetone).\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from NaOH removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate ion.\n2.  The acetone enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n3.  An initial aldol addition product is formed, which then readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). This dehydration is favored because it results in a highly conjugated system where the new double bond is conjugated with both the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group.\n\nThe resulting molecule is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The *trans* (E) isomer is the major product due to greater steric stability.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n\n### Molecular Symmetry of Product 3\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group, we analyze the structure of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\nThe molecule has a large, conjugated π-system which favors a planar arrangement of the heavy atoms (O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C=O). The methyl group is attached to this planar framework.\n\nLet's examine the symmetry elements present in the molecule:\n*   **Identity (E):** Present in all molecules.\n*   **Proper Axis of Rotation (Cₙ):** There are no rotation axes (other than C₁). For example, a C₂ axis is not present because rotating the molecule 180° does not result in an identical structure.\n*   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not possess a center of inversion.\n*   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The plane that contains the nitrophenyl ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O carbonyl group is a plane of symmetry. If one C-H bond of the terminal methyl group also lies in this plane, the other two hydrogen atoms of the methyl group will be symmetrically positioned above and below this plane. Thus, this molecular plane acts as a mirror plane (σ).\n\nSince the only symmetry element present, aside from the identity element, is a single plane of symmetry, the point group for this molecule is **Cₛ**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
