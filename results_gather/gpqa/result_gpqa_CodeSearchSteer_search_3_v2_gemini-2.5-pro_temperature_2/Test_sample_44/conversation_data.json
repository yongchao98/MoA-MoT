    "To determine the energies of the system, we first need to know the energy levels of a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy for a particle in such a well is quantized and given by the formula:\n\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nHere, *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), *m* is the mass of the particle, *L* is the length of the well, and *ħ* is the reduced Planck's constant. The problem defines E = π²ħ² / 2mL², so the energy of the n-th level is simply:\n\nE_n = n²E\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. Since the particles have spin, a quantum state is defined by the quantum number *n* and the spin projection (spin up or spin down). Consequently, each energy level *n* can accommodate a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**Ground State Energy**\n\nFor the ground state, the four particles must fill the lowest available energy levels.\n*   Two particles will occupy the n=1 level (E₁ = 1²E = E).\n*   The remaining two particles will occupy the n=2 level (E₂ = 2²E = 4E).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2 * E₁ + 2 * E₂ = 2 * E + 2 * (4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**First Excited State Energy**\n\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we need to promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the lowest available unoccupied energy level. In the ground state, the highest energy particles are in the n=2 level. The next available energy level is n=3 (E₃ = 3²E = 9E).\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in the n=1 level, one particle in the n=2 level, and one particle in the n=3 level.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first_excited = 2 * E₁ + 1 * E₂ + 1 * E₃ = 2 * E + 1 * (4E) + 1 * (9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**Second Excited State Energy**\n\nFor the second excited state, we look for the next lowest energy configuration possible after the first excited state. There are two possibilities to consider for an excitation from the ground state:\n\n1.  Promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=4 level (E₄ = 4²E = 16E).\n    *   Configuration: two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = 2*E₁ + 1*E₂ + 1*E₄ = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n2.  Promote one particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = 1*E₁ + 2*E₂ + 1*E₃ = 1*E + 2*(4E) + 1*(9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nComparing the possible energies, the lower of the two is 18E. Thus, the second excited state has an energy of 18E.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<D>>>"
