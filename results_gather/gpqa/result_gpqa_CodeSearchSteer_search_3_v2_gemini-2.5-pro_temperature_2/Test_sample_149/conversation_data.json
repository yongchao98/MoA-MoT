    "To solve this problem, we must first identify the starting compound from its molecular formula and NMR data, and then determine the product after the three-step reaction sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) that is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets with an integration of 2H, strongly suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal, a doublet integrating to two protons, corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH). This fits with it being coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   From the data, we have a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents: an amino group (-NH₂) and an ethanal group (-CH₂CHO).\n    *   Placing these groups on the benzene ring gives the structure 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (ring) + -NH₂ + -CH₂CHO gives a total of C₈H₉NO, which matches the given formula.\n\nTherefore, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n2.  **H₂O:** Adding water to the diazonium salt, typically with gentle warming, causes hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N₂) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This step converts the intermediate diazonium salt into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the aldehyde). These are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. The initial product is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"condensation\" implies the loss of a small molecule, in this case, water. The presence of heat drives the dehydration of the initially formed β-hydroxy aldehyde to yield a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. An exam tip for students is that if \"heat\" is mentioned in the context of an aldol reaction, the condensation product is the expected final answer.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Final Product\n\nLet's trace the aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde:\n\n*   **Molecule A (Enolate):** `HO-C₆H₄-CH⁻-CHO`\n*   **Molecule B (Electrophile):** `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO`\n*   **Attack & Addition:** Molecule A attacks Molecule B, followed by protonation, to form the β-hydroxy aldehyde: `HO-C₆H₄-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH₂-C₆H₄-OH`. The systematic name for this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option B).\n*   **Dehydration:** With heating, a molecule of water is eliminated from the addition product. The α-proton (on C2) and the β-hydroxyl group (on C3) are removed, creating a double bond between C2 and C3. This results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde: `HO-C₆H₄-C(CHO)=CH-CH₂-C₆H₄-OH`.\n*   **Final Product Name:** The resulting structure has a but-2-enal backbone. There are 4-hydroxyphenyl groups attached at positions C2 and C4. Thus, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis corresponds to Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
