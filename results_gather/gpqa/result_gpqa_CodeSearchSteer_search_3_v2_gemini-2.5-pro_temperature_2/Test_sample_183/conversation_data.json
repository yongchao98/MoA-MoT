    "An analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene requires careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents and the sequence of reactions. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe relative positions of these groups are as follows:\n*   Ethoxy and tert-butyl are *ortho* to each other.\n*   tert-Butyl and nitro are *ortho* to each other.\n*   Ethoxy and nitro are *meta* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern is generally challenging to achieve through direct electrophilic aromatic substitution due to the directing effects of the groups.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl):** An activating, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its bulkiness, it often directs incoming groups to the *para* position.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n**Option A:** This sequence contains a jumble of reactions, including repeated steps and confusing numbering, suggesting typos. Reconstructing a logical sequence from its reagents, such as a blocking group strategy with sulfonation, does not straightforwardly lead to the desired product's specific substitution pattern without assuming non-standard reactions or further typos. For example, a plausible route to make 2-tert-butylphenol can be devised, but its subsequent nitration would yield 4- and 6-nitro isomers, not the desired 3-nitro product.\n\n**Option B:** This option includes an chemically unsound step: the nitration of a diazonium salt (step vi). Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates and would not typically be subjected to strong nitrating conditions. This makes the sequence unviable.\n\n**Option C:** This sequence begins with the nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii) proposes a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3. This reaction is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the desired alkylation. Thus, this option is not synthetically viable.\n\n**Option D:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\ni) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\nii) **tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer.\niii) **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → 4-tert-butylaniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group.\niv) **4-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The amino group is a powerful *ortho, para*-director. Under acidic nitrating conditions, it exists as the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. However, even if some free amine reacts, it directs *ortho* to itself. Both scenarios favor nitration at the position *ortho* to the amine (and meta to the tert-butyl group). The product is 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.\nv) **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline + NaNO2/HCl → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenediazonium chloride:** Diazotization of the primary amino group.\nvi) **Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol.\nvii) **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene:** Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether.\n\nThe final product of this sequence is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. Let's compare this to the target molecule: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. These two are constitutional isomers, but they are not the same compound. In the product from option D, the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are *para* to each other, while in the target molecule, they are *ortho*.\n\nHowever, upon critical review, all the proposed options are flawed. Options A, B, and C contain chemically unsound or illogical steps. Option D outlines a coherent and viable synthesis, but it yields an isomer of the desired product. In the context of a multiple-choice question where there might be an error in the question itself (either in the options or the name of the target compound), Option D represents the most plausible and well-designed chemical pathway. If we assume a typo in the name of the target molecule, this option is the only one that describes a high-yield synthesis of a closely related structure. Without this assumption, none of the options are correct. Based on the analysis of sound chemical principles, option D is the most logical sequence of reactions, despite leading to an isomer of the named product. Given the flawed nature of the other options, D is the most likely intended answer, presuming an error in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>"
