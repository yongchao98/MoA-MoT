    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nThe annihilation process starts with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). Since the antiproton is described as \"slowly moving,\" we can assume both the proton and antiproton are approximately at rest. Their initial energy is therefore their combined rest mass energy.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_i):** The initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of an antiproton is the same as the mass of a proton ($m_p$).\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n\nThe process results in four particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$). These particles will be moving, so their total energy is the sum of their individual relativistic energies.\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_f):** The final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. Since they all have the same mass ($m_A$) and are produced in the same event from a stationary source, they will share the energy equally and have the same velocity (v). The energy of a single A particle is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the initial energy must equal the final energy.\n\n*   $E_i = E_f$\n*   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nWe are given the rest mass energy of particle A:\n\n*   $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is a known physical constant, approximately 938.3 MeV. Using a more precise value, it's about 938.272 MeV. Let's use 938.3 MeV for simplicity as it's a common approximation.\n\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Velocity (v)\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the formula:\n\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $v$:\n\n*   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2}$\n*   $1 - v^2/c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n*   $v^2/c^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, we substitute the value of $\\gamma$ we calculated:\n\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n*   $v \\approx 0.7688 c$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.77c.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the result to the given options:\n\nA) 0.91c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
