    "To determine the correct option, we will calculate the relative speed and the total energy of the system.\n\n### Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nThe formula for relativistic velocity subtraction is used to find the speed of one astronaut relative to the other. Both astronauts are moving in the same direction. Let v₁ be the speed of the first astronaut (2m) and v₂ be the speed of the second astronaut (3m) as measured from a stationary reference frame.\n\nGiven:\n*   v₁ = 0.6c\n*   v₂ = 0.5c\n\nThe relative speed v_rel is calculated as:\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n**v_rel ≈ 0.14c**\n\n### Calculation of Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic system is the sum of the individual total energies of its components. The total energy of a single particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated using the formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n*   **Lorentz factor (γ₁):**\n    γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)² / c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   **Energy (E₁):**\n    E₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2mc² = 2.5mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n*   **Lorentz factor (γ₂):**\n    γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)² / c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1.1547\n*   **Energy (E₂):**\n    E₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc² ≈ 3.4641mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\nE_total = E₁ + E₂\nE_total ≈ 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc²\n**E_total ≈ 5.96mc²**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are a relative speed of approximately **0.14c** and a total energy of approximately **5.96mc²**. These results correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
