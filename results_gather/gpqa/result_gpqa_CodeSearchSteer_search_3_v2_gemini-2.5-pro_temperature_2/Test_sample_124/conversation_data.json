    "The problem asks for the energy and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for the third excited state of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n### 1. Energy Levels\n\nThe potential is given by V(r) = (1/2)mω²r², which corresponds to the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The Hamiltonian for this system can be separated in Cartesian coordinates, and the total energy is the sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\nE_n = (n + 3/2)ħω.\n\nHere, `n = n_x + n_y + n_z`, where `n_x`, `n_y`, and `n_z` are the quantum numbers for the motion along the x, y, and z axes, respectively. These quantum numbers can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe energy levels are determined by the value of `n`:\n*   **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when n = 0.\n    E₀ = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω.\n*   **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level, corresponding to n = 1.\n    E₁ = (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω.\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to n = 2.\n    E₂ = (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω.\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to n = 3.\n    E₃ = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω.\n\n### 2. Degeneracy\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have the same energy. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, this is the number of ways the non-negative integers `n_x`, `n_y`, and `n_z` can be chosen to sum to a given integer `n`.\n\nThe formula for the degeneracy, g_n, of the n-th energy level is:\ng_n = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2.\n\nFor the third excited state, we have n = 3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\ng₃ = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2\ng₃ = (4)(5) / 2\ng₃ = 20 / 2\ng₃ = 10.\n\nThe ten possible combinations of (n_x, n_y, n_z) that sum to 3 are:\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its two other permutations: (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — (3 states)\n*   (2, 1, 0) and all its permutations: (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — (6 states)\n*   (1, 1, 1) — (1 state)\n\nThe total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is **(9/2)ħω**, and it has a degeneracy of **10**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
