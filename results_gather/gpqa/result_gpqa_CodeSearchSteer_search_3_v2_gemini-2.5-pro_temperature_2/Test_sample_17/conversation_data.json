    "To calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we need to determine the silicon abundance for each star relative to a common element, typically hydrogen. The provided information on stellar masses and the specific values for solar abundances are not required for this calculation, as the problem can be solved using the relative abundance ratios.\n\n### Understanding the Notation\n\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of two elements, X and Y, in a star compared to the Sun. The formula is:\n\n`[X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_sun )`\n\nHere, `n_X` and `n_Y` are the number densities (number of atoms per unit volume) of elements X and Y. A useful identity derived from this definition is `[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`, where H is hydrogen.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Silicon Abundance in Star_1\n\nWe are given the following for Star_1:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0.0`\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`\n\nUsing the identity `[Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1`, we can solve for the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio `[Si/H]_1`:\n\n`0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0.0`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3`\n\nThis result indicates that the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is `10^0.3` times the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in the Sun.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Silicon Abundance in Star_2\n\nFor Star_2, we have:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0.0`\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`\n\nUsing the same identity, `[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`, we can determine the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance `[Si/H]_2`:\n\n`0.3 = 0.0 - [Si/H]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`\n\nThis means the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is `10^-0.3` times that of the Sun.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Ratio of Silicon Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. This is interpreted as the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen, which is the standard measure in stellar astrophysics.\n\nRatio = `(n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`\n\nFrom the definition of `[X/H]`, we know:\n*   `(n_Si / n_H)_1 = (n_Si / n_H)_sun * 10^([Si/H]_1) = (n_Si / n_H)_sun * 10^0.3`\n*   `(n_Si / n_H)_2 = (n_Si / n_H)_sun * 10^([Si/H]_2) = (n_Si / n_H)_sun * 10^-0.3`\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio:\n\nRatio = `( (n_Si / n_H)_sun * 10^0.3 ) / ( (n_Si / n_H)_sun * 10^-0.3 )`\nRatio = `10^0.3 / 10^-0.3`\nRatio = `10^(0.3 - (-0.3))`\nRatio = `10^0.6`\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n\n`10^0.6 â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\n<<<D>>>"
