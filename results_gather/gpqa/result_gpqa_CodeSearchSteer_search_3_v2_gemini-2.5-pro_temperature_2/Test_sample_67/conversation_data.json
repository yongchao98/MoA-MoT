    "The physical phenomenon described is Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The spin-1/2 particle has its magnetic moment `μ = γS` aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a spin-up state along the z-axis, which is an eigenstate of the `S_z` operator. The initial state is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: The magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian that governs the system's time evolution is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γB * S_y`, where `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The expectation value (or average) of the z-component of the spin, `<S_z>`, can be shown to evolve according to the following differential equations, derived from the Ehrenfest theorem or the Heisenberg equation of motion:\n    *   `d<S_z>/dt = -γB <S_x>`\n    *   `d<S_x>/dt = γB <S_z>`\n\n4.  **Oscillation Equation**: By differentiating the first equation with respect to time and substituting the second equation into it, we obtain a second-order differential equation for `<S_z>`:\n    *   `d²<S_z>/dt² = - (γB)² <S_z>`\n\n5.  **Frequency of Oscillation**: This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`, where `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation. By comparing the two equations, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation for `<S_z>`.\n\n    The angular frequency `ω` is `γB`. This is the Larmor frequency for a particle with gyromagnetic ratio `γ` in a magnetic field of magnitude `B`. The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`, is proportional to `<S_z(t)>`, and thus it oscillates at the same frequency.\n\nThe calculation based on quantum mechanics confirms that the precession frequency is `ω = γB`. The search results confirm that for a spin in a magnetic field, the resulting precession frequency is the Larmor frequency, given by `ω = |γB|`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
