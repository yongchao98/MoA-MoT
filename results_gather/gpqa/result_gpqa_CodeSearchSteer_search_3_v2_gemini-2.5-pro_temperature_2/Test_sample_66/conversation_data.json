    "In quantum mechanics, the addition of angular momenta is governed by specific conservation rules. The state of the two-electron system is given as `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. Here, `l₁=1` and `l₂=1` are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=2`, and its projection on the z-axis is `m=-1`.\n\nThe z-component of the total angular momentum, `L_z`, is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta, `L₁z` and `L₂z`. This relationship is also true for their corresponding quantum numbers: `m = m₁ + m₂`. This rule is a fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta.\n\nThe measurement of `L₁z` and `L₂z` yields eigenvalues of `m₁ħ` and `m₂ħ` respectively. The question asks for the probability of obtaining `L₁z = -ħ` and `L₂z = -ħ`. This corresponds to a measurement outcome where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\nIf we sum these individual quantum numbers, we get `m₁ + m₂ = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\nHowever, the system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number `m` is -1. According to the conservation rule `m = m₁ + m₂`, any measurement of `m₁` and `m₂` must result in a sum of -1.\n\nSince the sum of the desired measurement outcomes (`m₁ + m₂ = -2`) is not equal to the system's total magnetic quantum number (`m = -1`), it is impossible to obtain this result. The probability of an event that violates this conservation rule is zero.\n\nTo be more formal, the coupled state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of the uncoupled states `|m₁, m₂>`. This superposition, determined by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, only includes terms where `m₁ + m₂ = -1`. The state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>` is not a part of this superposition because `m₁ + m₂ = -2`. Therefore, the projection of the system's state onto the desired measurement outcome is zero, and the probability, which is the square of this projection, is also zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
