    "The reaction of an enol with bromine (Br2) results in the formation of an α-haloketone. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. This is the enol tautomer of 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\nThe reaction mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the enol's electron-rich double bond on the electrophilic bromine molecule.\n\n1.  **Structure of the starting material**: 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol has a five-membered ring. There is a double bond between carbon 1 (C1) and carbon 2 (C2), and a hydroxyl (-OH) group is attached to C1. Two methyl groups are attached to C4.\n2.  **Reaction with Bromine**: The π electrons of the C1=C2 double bond attack a Br atom from a Br₂ molecule. This attack occurs at C2 because the resulting positive charge at C1 is stabilized by resonance with the lone pairs of the oxygen atom.\n3.  **Tautomerization**: After the bromine atom attaches to C2, the intermediate quickly rearranges to the more stable keto form. This involves the formation of a carbonyl group (C=O) at C1 and the removal of the proton from the hydroxyl group.\n\nThe final product is a cyclopentanone ring with the following substituents:\n*   A carbonyl group at C1.\n*   A bromine atom at the alpha position (C2).\n*   Two methyl groups at C4.\n\nTherefore, the major product is **2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol**: This is an addition product where the double bond is broken, and two bromine atoms are added, which is not the characteristic reaction of an enol.\n*   **B) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**: Bromination occurs at the α-carbon of the enol (C2), not at the saturated C4 position.\n*   **C) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**: This matches the expected outcome of the alpha-bromination of an enol.\n*   **D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol**: This is another diastereomer of the incorrect addition product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
