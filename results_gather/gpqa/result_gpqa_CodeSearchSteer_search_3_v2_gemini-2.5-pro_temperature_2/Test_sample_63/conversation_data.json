    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent. The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O produced = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no significant amount of acidic gas was produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This means 0.80 g of oxygen atoms reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms reacted = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas. The most plausible candidates produced from heating nitrogen-based salts are nitrous oxide (N₂O) or oxygen (O₂).\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol. This gas is inert to all the previous reagents. Nitrogen (N₂) is a very likely candidate.\n\n**2. Identification of the Decomposition Reaction**\n\nLet's assume the products of the decomposition are H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen-containing nitrogen gas like N₂O. This is common for heating ammonium salts.\n\n*   When the gas mixture passes through hot copper, N₂O decomposes: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂.\n*   The 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms that formed CuO must have come from 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n*   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n*   The final 0.10 mol of gas C (assumed to be N₂) is the sum of the N₂ originally present and the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction.\n*   Therefore, moles of original N₂ + 0.05 mol = 0.10 mol. This means the initial decomposition produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\nSo, the heating of the salt mixture A and B yielded:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nWe are looking for an equimolar mixture of two salts that, upon heating, produce these exact amounts of gases. Ammonium salts of oxidizing acids are known to decompose into nitrogen oxides and water.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** decomposes upon heating to 200°C to form nitrous oxide and water:\n    NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** decomposes upon heating to form nitrogen and water:\n    NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nLet's assume salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite, and the mixture contains `n` moles of each.\n*   n NH₄NO₃ → n N₂O + 2n H₂O\n*   n NH₄NO₂ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O\n\n**Total Products:**\n*   Moles of N₂O = n\n*   Moles of N₂ = n\n*   Moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n\nComparing this with our calculated products:\n*   n (moles of N₂O) = 0.05 mol\n*   n (moles of N₂) = 0.05 mol\n*   4n (moles of H₂O) = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol\n\nThe mole ratios match perfectly. Thus, the initial mixture consisted of 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂.\n\n**4. Verification by Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g.\nThis confirms our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salt A and salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal atoms in both salts = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
