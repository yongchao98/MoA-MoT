    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of the buffer components**\n    The solution contains KH₂PO₄ (which provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion, H₂PO₄⁻) and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (which provides the hydrogen phosphate ion, HPO₄²⁻).\n\n    *   **Moles of KH₂PO₄ (acid component):**\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n        Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol of H₂PO₄⁻\n    *   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (base component):**\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n        Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol of HPO₄²⁻\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components**\n    The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n\n    *   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n        [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n        [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]**\n    The H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer system is governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Kₐ₂. The equilibrium is:\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    Kₐ₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n\n    We can find the [H⁺] using the expression for Kₐ₂:\n    Kₐ₂ = ([H⁺] [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\n    Rearranging for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Kₐ₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] = 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration**\n    The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This equilibrium is governed by the third dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Kₐ₃.\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    Kₐ₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\n    We can find the [PO₄³⁻] using the expression for Kₐ₃:\n    Kₐ₃ = ([H⁺] [PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\n    Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] = 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n5.  **Final Answer**\n    The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M, which rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<A>>>"
