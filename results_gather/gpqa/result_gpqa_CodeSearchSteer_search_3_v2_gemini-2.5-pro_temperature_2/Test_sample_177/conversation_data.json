    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and assess the renormalizability of the theory, we must analyze the given Lagrangian term:\n\n**\\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\\)**\n\n1.  **Determine the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density.**\n    In four-dimensional spacetime, the action \\(S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}\\) must be a dimensionless quantity. The spacetime volume element \\(d^4x\\) has a mass dimension of [M]⁻⁴. For the action S to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must have a mass dimension of [M]⁴.\n\n2.  **Determine the mass dimension of each field and tensor in the term.**\n    *   **Fermion field (\\(\\psi\\)):** The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is \\(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of [M]⁴, given that \\([\\partial_\\mu] = [M]^1\\) and \\(\\gamma^\\mu\\) is dimensionless, the combined dimension of \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\) must be [M]³. This implies that the fermion field \\(\\psi\\) (and its adjoint \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\)) has a mass dimension of **[M]^(3/2)**.\n    *   **\\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\):** This tensor is defined as \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}]\\). Since the gamma matrices \\(\\gamma_\\mu\\) are dimensionless, \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is also dimensionless, having a mass dimension of **[M]⁰**.\n    *   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor (\\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\)):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field in the Lagrangian is \\(-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of [M]⁴, \\( (F^{\\mu\\nu})^2 \\) must have a dimension of [M]⁴. Therefore, the field strength tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) has a mass dimension of **[M]²**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the mass dimension of κ.**\n    We equate the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density with the product of the dimensions of all its components:\n    \\([\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [\\psi] [F^{\\mu\\nu}]\\)\n    Plugging in the known dimensions:\n    \\([M]^4 = [\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^{3/2} \\cdot [M]^0 \\cdot [M]^{3/2} \\cdot [M]^2\\)\n    \\([M]^4 = [\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^{(3/2 + 3/2 + 2)}\\)\n    \\([M]^4 = [\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^5\\)\n    Solving for the mass dimension of κ:\n    \\([\\kappa] = \\frac{[M]^4}{[M]^5} = [M]^{-1}\\)\n\n    The mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n4.  **Determine the renormalizability of the theory.**\n    A key criterion for determining if a theory is renormalizable by power-counting is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n    *   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the interaction is *super-renormalizable*.\n    *   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension (it is dimensionless), the interaction is *renormalizable*.\n    *   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the interaction is *non-renormalizable*.\n\n    Since the mass dimension of κ is -1, which is negative, the theory is **not renormalizable**. Theories with coupling constants that have a negative mass dimension require an infinite number of counterterms to cancel all the divergences that appear in loop calculations, making them lose their predictive power at high energies. The term given is an example of an effective field theory operator, which might also be referred to as a Pauli term.\n\nBased on this analysis, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n<<<C>>>"
