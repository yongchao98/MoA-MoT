    "1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism can arise in such compounds due to hindered rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings, a phenomenon known as atropisomerism. For atropisomerism to occur, the substituents in the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') must be bulky enough to restrict free rotation. In this molecule, all four ortho-positions are substituted with large groups (two nitro groups and two dimethyl carboxylate groups), which causes significant steric hindrance. This restricted rotation leads to a non-planar, chiral conformation, making the molecule and its mirror image non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are optically active, existing as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers (D and L forms). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The structure of benzophenone features a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings. The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule possesses elements of symmetry and is not chiral under normal conditions. While some heavily substituted benzophenones can be forced into a chiral conformation, unsubstituted benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. It is a planar molecule and possesses a center of symmetry, which means it is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It is a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate, but it is not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are optically active.\n\n<<<A>>>"
