    "The performed search confirms the initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity**: The Doppler formula for light is v_r = c * (Δλ / λ₀), where v_r is the radial velocity, c is the speed of light, Δλ is the observed wavelength shift, and λ₀ is the rest wavelength. The amplitude of the radial velocity curve, K, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift, Δλ_max. Therefore, K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7/5 = 1.4.\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) and Orbital Period (P)**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star + m_p)^(2/3).\n\n    Given that the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (m_p << M_star), which is true for a Neptune-mass planet and a Sun-like star, the formula can be simplified to:\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star)^(2/3).\n\nThe problem states:\n*   M_star1 = M_star2 (same mass)\n*   m_p1 ≈ m_p2 (similar mass)\n*   Orbits are circular (e=0)\n*   It's a common simplification in these types of problems to assume the orbital inclinations (i) are comparable, or the question is asking for a relationship that is independent of inclination unless stated otherwise. If we assume i₁ = i₂, all the terms except P and K are the same for both systems.\n\nLet's establish the relationship between K and P.\nFrom the simplified formula, we can see that K is proportional to P^(-1/3).\nK₁ ∝ P₁^(-1/3)\nK₂ ∝ P₂^(-1/3)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₂^(-1/3)) / (P₁^(-1/3)) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nFrom the given wavelength shifts, we know:\nK₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\nNow, we set the two expressions for the ratio equal:\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo find the ratio P₂ / P₁, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n1.4³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nFinally, we invert the expression to get the desired ratio:\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which matches option C. The entire logical chain is confirmed and the calculation is straightforward. No further information is required.\n\nFinal answer seems to be C.\nThe final answer is C.\n\nA) ~ 1.40: This would be the case if P was inversely proportional to K, which is not correct.\nB) ~ 0.85: Incorrect calculation.\nC) ~ 0.36: Matches the calculation P₂/P₁ = (K₁/K₂)³ = (5/7)³ ≈ 0.36.\nD) ~ 1.96: This would be 1.4², which is not the correct relationship.\n\nCalculation: (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644314...\nCalculation: 1 / 1.4³ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644314...\n\nThe result is robust.\nTo solve this problem, we need to relate the observed periodic shift of the spectral line to the orbital period of the planet.\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the Doppler shift in the host star's spectrum. The shift in wavelength (Δλ) is proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum observed wavelength shift (the amplitude of the shift) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n\n    *   For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstrom, so K₁ ∝ 5.\n    *   For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstrom, so K₂ ∝ 7.\n\n    The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is therefore K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n2.  **Relating Stellar Velocity Amplitude to Orbital Period:** The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is determined by the masses of the star (M_star) and the planet (m_p), the orbital period (P), and the inclination of the orbit (i) to our line of sight. For a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass is much less than the star's (which is valid for a Neptune-mass planet around a Sun-like star), the relationship is:\n\n    K ≈ [ (2πG) / (P * M_star²) ]^(1/3) * m_p * sin(i)  \n\n3.  **Comparing the Two Systems:** We are given that the stars have the same mass (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planets have similar masses (m_p1 ≈ m_p2). The problem does not specify the orbital inclinations. A common simplifying assumption in such problems is that the viewing angles are similar (sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)), or we solve for the general relationship independent of the unknown sin(i) factor.\n\n    Based on the formula, we can see the relationship between the velocity amplitude K and the orbital period P:\n\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** We can write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes for the two systems:\n\n    K₂ / K₁ = ( P₂^(-1/3) ) / ( P₁^(-1/3) ) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the required ratio, P₂ / P₁, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n\n    1.4³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    Now, we take the reciprocal of this value to find P₂ / P₁:\n\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>"
