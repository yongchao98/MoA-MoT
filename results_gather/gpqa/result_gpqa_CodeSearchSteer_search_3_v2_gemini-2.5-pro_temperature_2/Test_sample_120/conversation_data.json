    "The reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate (Gilman reagent) is a well-established method for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an SN2-type mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereoselectivity of the product.\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity**: The problem states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. In this molecule, the epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6 of a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   Carbon C6 is not substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the methyl group (Me⁻) from the lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi) will attack C6.\n\n2.  **Product Skeleton**: The nucleophilic attack of the methyl group at C6 opens the epoxide ring by breaking the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup, forms a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This means the resulting product is a cyclohexanol. The original methyl groups were at positions C1, C3, and C4, and a new methyl group is added at C6. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is designated C1. The numbering then proceeds to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants. The new methyl group is at the adjacent position (old C6), which becomes C2. Tracing the substituents around the ring, they fall at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. Thus, the product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This determination eliminates options A and C.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The problem also states that an inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added.\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of (S). Due to the SN2-like attack, the configuration at this center will be inverted to (R). In the final product, this carbon is C2, so its configuration is (2R).\n    *   The other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the bond-making or bond-breaking steps. Therefore, their absolute configurations are retained.\n        *   C1 retains its (R) configuration and is C1 in the product: (1R).\n        *   C4 retains its (R) configuration and is C4 in the product: (4R).\n        *   C3 retains its (R) configuration, but in the new numbering scheme, it becomes C5: (5R).\n\n4.  **Final Product**: Combining these stereochemical assignments, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
