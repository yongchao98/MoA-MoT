    "The correct approach to designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a quick detection of a retrovirus is described in option B. A retrovirus has an RNA genome, which must first be converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) before its genetic material can be sequenced and analyzed. Real-time PCR is a rapid and highly sensitive method for detecting this genetic material.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why option B is the most scientifically sound approach:\n*   **Identify the virus by cDNA sequencing**: A retrovirus is an RNA virus. To determine its genetic sequence, the RNA must be converted to a more stable complementary DNA (cDNA) strand through a process called reverse transcription. Sequencing this cDNA allows for the precise identification of the virus's genetic code. This information is essential for designing a specific and accurate diagnostic test.\n\n*   **Develop a real-time PCR kit**: Real-time PCR, also known as quantitative PCR (qPCR), is a \"gold standard\" molecular technique for detecting nucleic acids. In the case of a retrovirus, the method used is Reverse Transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR), which incorporates the initial reverse transcription step. This method is ideal for an outbreak because it is highly sensitive, specific, and provides results much faster than conventional methods.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **A) IgG Antibodies and ELISA**: This describes a serological test, not a molecular one. An ELISA detects the body's immune response (antibodies) to a pathogen, not the pathogen itself. IgG antibodies can take weeks to develop, making this method unsuitable for *quick* detection during the early stages of an infection.\n*   **C) DNA Sequencing**: This is incorrect because retroviruses have RNA genomes, not DNA. Direct DNA sequencing is therefore not possible without first converting the RNA to cDNA.\n*   **D) Symptom-based nested PCR**: Designing a specific PCR test, which relies on targeting unique genetic sequences, is not possible based on patient symptoms alone. Different viruses can cause similar symptoms, so the viral genetic sequence must be known to create the specific primers required for a PCR-based test.\n\n<<<B>>>"
