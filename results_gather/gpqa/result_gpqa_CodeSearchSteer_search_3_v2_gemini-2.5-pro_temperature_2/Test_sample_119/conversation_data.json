    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Assume uniform stellar density.** Let's assume stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number of stars per unit volume, ρ, is constant.\n\n2.  **Consider stars at a distance.** The number of stars (dN) in a thin spherical shell with radius *d* and thickness *dd* is the product of the stellar density (ρ) and the volume of the shell (dV = 4πd²dd).\n    *   dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd\n\n3.  **Relate distance to parallax.** Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d). In astronomy, the relationship is simplified to `d = 1/plx` when *d* is in parsecs and *plx* is in arcseconds.\n\n4.  **Connect the differentials.** We need to find the relationship between the differential distance element *dd* and the differential parallax element *d(plx)*. We can find this by taking the derivative of d with respect to plx:\n    *   `d(d)/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   Ignoring the negative sign, which only indicates that distance and parallax are inversely related, we get `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute and find the final relation.** Now, substitute the expressions for *d* and *dd* back into the equation for the number of stars (dN):\n    *   dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)\n    *   dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n6.  **Interpret the result.** The term we are interested in is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can see that:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n\nTherefore, for a uniform distribution of stars in the sky, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<B>>>"
