    "To identify the number of 13C-NMR signals, we must first determine the chemical structure of the final product, E, by analyzing the given reaction sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**: This reaction protects the aldehyde functional group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH). The product, A, is a thioacetal called 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the acidic proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2 of the dithiolane ring). Product B is the resulting nucleophilic carbanion (as a lithium salt).\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The carbanion B acts as a nucleophile and attacks bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an SN2 reaction. An ethyl group is added to the C2 position, which already holds an ethyl group from the original propionaldehyde. Product C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: This step is the deprotection of the thioacetal, converting it back to a carbonyl group. The C2 carbon, which is bonded to two ethyl groups, becomes a ketone. Product D is 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, the Wittig ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and butyllithium (BuLi). PPh₃ attacks 3-bromopentane, and subsequent deprotonation by BuLi yields the ylide: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   This ylide then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The carbonyl oxygen is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n    *   The reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₃CH₂)₂ + Ph₃P=O.\n    *   The final product, E, is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E\n\nThe final product is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, which has the following structure:\n```\n      CH₂-CH₃\n     /\nCH₃-CH₂-C = C-CH₂-CH₃\n          \\\n           CH₂-CH₃\n```\nThis is a highly symmetrical molecule. We need to count the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms. Due to the molecule's symmetry (a C2 axis through the center of the C=C double bond), several carbons are chemically equivalent:\n\n1.  **Alkene Carbons**: The two carbons involved in the central C=C double bond are in identical environments. They will produce a single signal.\n2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: There are four ethyl groups attached to the double bond. Because of the molecule's symmetry, all four methylene carbons (-CH₂-) of these ethyl groups are equivalent. They will produce one combined signal.\n3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃)**: Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons (-CH₃) of the ethyl groups are all equivalent. They will also produce a single signal.\n\nTherefore, despite having a total of 10 carbon atoms, the high degree of symmetry in 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene results in only **three** distinct signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
