    "The defining spectral feature is the significant drop in flux at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm. This is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha forest, which indicates a sharp cutoff at the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line due to absorption by neutral hydrogen. The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyα transition is approximately 121.6 nm. At high redshifts, this absorption becomes so pronounced that it creates a distinct \"break\" in the spectrum.\n\nTo determine the quasar's distance, we first need to calculate its redshift (z). The redshift is the measure of the stretching of light's wavelength as it travels through the expanding universe. It can be calculated with the formula:\n\nz = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\nGiven:\n*   Observed wavelength (λ_observed) = 790 nm\n*   Rest-frame wavelength of Lyα (λ_rest) = 121.6 nm\n\nCalculation:\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1 ≈ 6.497 - 1 ≈ 5.5\n\nWith the redshift established as approximately 5.5, we can now calculate the comoving distance. The comoving distance is a measure of distance that factors out the expansion of the universe, providing a stable reference for objects moving with the cosmic flow. The calculation requires the cosmological parameters provided:\n\n*   Hubble constant (H₀) = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Matter density parameter (Ω_m) = 0.3\n*   Dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ) = 0.7\n*   A flat universe (consistent with Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1)\n\nUsing these values in a cosmological calculator, the comoving distance for a redshift of z = 5.5 is approximately 9 Gpc.\n\nTherefore, based on the observed spectral break and the given cosmological model, the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth can be assumed to be 9 Gpc.\n\n<<<A>>>"
