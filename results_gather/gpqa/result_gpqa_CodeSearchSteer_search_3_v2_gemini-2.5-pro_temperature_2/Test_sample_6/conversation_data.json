    "To determine the energy at which high-energy gamma-rays ($\\gamma$) have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we need to calculate the threshold energy for the pair production process $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\nHere's the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Principle of Pair Production**: For an electron-positron pair to be created, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two colliding photons must be at least the combined rest mass energy of the electron and the positron. The rest mass energy of a single electron ($m_e c^2$) is approximately 0.511 MeV. Therefore, the minimum energy required is $2 \\times m_e c^2 = 1.022$ MeV.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Kinematics**: Let the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray be $E_\\gamma$ and the energy of the CMB photon be $E_{CMB}$. The condition for pair production is most easily met in a head-on collision. The threshold energy ($E_{th}$) is derived from the invariance of the square of the four-momentum. For a head-on collision, the threshold energy of the gamma-ray is given by the formula:\n\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n3.  **Known Values**:\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$) is $0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   The average energy of a CMB photon ($E_{CMB}$) is given as $10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n4.  **Calculation**: Now, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n    $E_\\gamma = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\n5.  **Unit Conversion**: The options are given in giga-electron volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$. To convert our result to GeV:\n\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    This can be written as $2.61 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThis calculated value matches option C most closely. Gamma-rays with energies at or above this threshold will have a significantly reduced mean free path in the universe due to frequent interactions with CMB photons, effectively limiting their lifetime.\n\n<<<C>>>"
