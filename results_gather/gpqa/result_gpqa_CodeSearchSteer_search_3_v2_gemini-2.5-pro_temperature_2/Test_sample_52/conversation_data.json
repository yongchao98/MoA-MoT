    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core formula for this ring part is therefore C6H4.\n    *   The aromatic ring itself accounts for four degrees of unsaturation (one for the ring and three for the double bonds within it).\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The spectrum shows an \"ester group\" (-COO-). This functional group contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms (O2). It also includes a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons (C6**H4**). Having only two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly a para (1,4) substitution, which would result in two chemically distinct types of protons.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The presence of two such signals confirms a C=C bond. The splitting patterns provide more detail:\n        *   A \"doublet\" means the proton is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n        *   A \"doublet of quartets\" means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a methyl (-CH3) group (giving the quartet).\n        *   This pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This group contains 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (C3H5) and has one double bond, adding one more degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **–CH3 groups (2 signals):** The compound has two distinct methyl groups.\n        *   One methyl group is part of the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-**CH3**), as identified from the vinyl-H splitting.\n        *   The second methyl group must be associated with the ester functionality. Since there are \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\", an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) is ruled out. Therefore, the ester must be either a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-OCOCH3)**. Both possibilities involve a second -CH3 group.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint that eliminates many other possible structures.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Pieces and Determine the Formula:**\n\n    *   **Carbon atoms:**\n        *   Benzene ring: 6 Carbons\n        *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 Carbons\n        *   Ester group (either -**C**OOCH3 or -O**C**O**C**H3): 2 Carbons\n        *   **Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 Carbons**\n\n    *   **Hydrogen atoms:**\n        *   Aromatic ring (-C6**H4**-): 4 Hydrogens\n        *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 Hydrogens\n        *   Methyl from the ester group (-COOCH**3** or -OCOCH**3**): 3 Hydrogens\n        *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12 Hydrogens**\n\n    *   **Oxygen atoms:**\n        *   Ester group (-COO-): 2 Oxygens\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The molecular formula assembled from the spectral data is **C11H12O2**.\n\nThis formula corresponds to structures like methyl 4-propenylbenzoate or 4-propenylphenyl acetate, both of which are consistent with all the provided spectral information. Comparing this derived formula to the given options:\n\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H14O2\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
