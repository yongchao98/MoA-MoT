    "The reaction described involves the treatment of compounds A and B with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and water (H₂O) to produce two different α-diketones. The combination of NaNO₂ and HCl generates nitrous acid (HONO) in situ. This reagent is used for the nitrosation of ketones at the α-carbon, which upon hydrolysis, yields a 1,2-diketone (or α-diketone). The reaction proceeds by converting a methylene group (CH₂) adjacent to a carbonyl group into a new carbonyl group.\n\n**Reaction A: Formation of 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**\n\nThe product is an α-diketone derived from a cyclohexane ring. For this reaction to occur, the starting material, A, must be a ketone with a methylene group (CH₂) alpha to the carbonyl.\nThe logical precursor is 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one. This ketone has a carbonyl at the C1 position and an isopropyl group at the C4 position. The carbons alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl are C2 and C6. Both of these are methylene groups. Treatment with nitrous acid will oxidize one of these α-methylene groups to a carbonyl group, resulting in the formation of 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. The other option for compound A presented in the choices, 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, is an alcohol and would not undergo this specific transformation.\n\n**Reaction B: Formation of 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**\n\nThe product is an acyclic α-diketone, 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. The starting material, B, must be a ketone that can be oxidized at the appropriate position.\nLet's consider the possible precursor from the options, 5-methylhexan-2-one. This ketone has the structure CH₃-CO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. The carbonyl group is at the C2 position. The alpha carbons are C1 (a methyl group) and C3 (a methylene group). The reaction with nitrous acid selectively oxidizes the α-methylene group at C3 into a carbonyl group. This transformation directly yields the desired product, 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. The other option provided for compound B, 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol, is a di-alcohol and would require different reagents for oxidation to a diketone.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct starting materials are 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one for A and 5-methylhexan-2-one for B.\n\nTherefore, the proper starting materials are:\n*   A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one\n*   B = 5-methylhexan-2-one\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
