    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Normalize the quantum state\n\nThe given state `|alpha>` is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. Let's call the unnormalized state `|ψ>`.\n`|ψ> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`\n\nIn vector notation, this can be written as:\n`|ψ> = [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\nTo normalize the state, we need to find the squared norm `<ψ|ψ>`, where `<ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ>`:\n`<ψ| = [(1-i), (2+i)]`\n\nNow, calculate the inner product:\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) = (1² - i²) + (2² - i²) = (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1)) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant `N` is `1/√(<ψ|ψ>) = 1/√7`.\nTherefore, the normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|alpha> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\n### 2. Define the operator A and find its eigenstates and eigenvalues\n\nThe operator `A` is defined by its matrix elements `Aij = ħ/2` if `i ≠ j` and `0` otherwise. For a 2-level system, this gives the matrix:\n`A = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nTo find the eigenvalues `λ`, we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0`\nThis gives the eigenvalues:\n`λ₁ = +ħ/2` and `λ₂ = -ħ/2`\n\nNext, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\nFor `λ₁ = +ħ/2`:\n` (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [[x], [y]] = (ħ/2) * [[x], [y]]`\n` [[y], [x]] = [[x], [y]] `\nThis implies `x = y`. The normalized eigenvector is `|a₁> = (1/√2) * [[1], [1]] = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\nFor `λ₂ = -ħ/2`:\n`(ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [[x], [y]] = (-ħ/2) * [[x], [y]]`\n`[[y], [x]] = [[-x], [-y]]`\nThis implies `y = -x`. The normalized eigenvector is `|a₂> = (1/√2) * [[1], [-1]] = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the probabilities\n\nThe probability `P(λi)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λi` is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of `|alpha>` onto the corresponding eigenstate `|ai>`, i.e., `P(λi) = |<ai|alpha>|²`.\n\nProbability of measuring `λ₁ = +ħ/2`:\n`P(λ₁) = |<a₁|alpha>|²`\n`<a₁|alpha> = [(1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n`<a₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * [(1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i)] = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14`\n`P(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\nProbability of measuring `λ₂ = -ħ/2`:\n`P(λ₂) = |<a₂|alpha>|²`\n`<a₂|alpha> = [(1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n`<a₂|alpha> = (1/√14) * [(1)(1+i) - (1)(2-i)] = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14`\n`P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nAs a check, the probabilities sum to unity: `9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`.\nThe calculated probabilities, approximately 0.64 and 0.36, match option D.\n\n### 4. Find the average (expectation) value of the operator\n\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n\n**Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n`<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7`\n\n**Method 2: Using the definition `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`**\n`<A> = (1/√7) * [(1-i), (2+i)] * (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/√7) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [(1-i), (2+i)] * [[0* (1+i) + 1* (2-i)], [1*(1+i) + 0*(2-i)]]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [(1-i), (2+i)] * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [(2 - i - 2i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²)]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * 2 = ħ/7`\n\nBoth methods yield `<A> = ħ/7`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of `A` are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**. The average value of the operator `A` is **ħ/7**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
