    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement. This type of reaction is common for 1,5-dienes and proceeds through a concerted, cyclic transition state, often visualized as a chair-like conformation.\n\nThe starting material is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. The reaction involves the reorganization of the sigma and pi bonds within the hexa-1,5-diene core of the molecule (carbons 2 through 7). A search of chemical literature and databases reveals that this specific reaction results in the formation of 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene. The rearrangement leads to a new structural isomer with a different carbon skeleton but the same molecular formula (C13H24). The product is favored due to the formation of a more stable molecule.\n\nThe reaction can be summarized as follows:\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 5-butylnona-2,6-diene\n*   **Reaction Condition:** Heat\n*   **Reaction Type:** Cope Rearrangement (-sigmatropic shift)\n*   **Product:** 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n\nComparing this outcome with the given options, both A and D are \"5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\".\n\n<<<A>>>"
