    "The Mott-Gurney equation is built on a specific set of assumptions about the physical conditions within the semiconductor device. An analysis of these conditions reveals the correct statement regarding its validity.\n\nKey assumptions for the Mott-Gurney Law include:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device**: The current is assumed to be carried by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes.\n*   **Trap-Free**: The model assumes an ideal insulator or semiconductor with no trap states that could capture and immobilize the charge carriers. The presence of traps alters the current-voltage relationship.\n*   **Ohmic Contact**: The charge-injecting contact must be Ohmic. This means it provides an unlimited supply of carriers and presents no energy barrier to injection. This ensures the current is limited by the transport of charge through the bulk of the material (space-charge-limited) rather than by the injection process itself. A Schottky contact, which has an injection barrier, would violate this assumption.\n*   **Negligible Diffusion Current**: The derivation of the Mott-Gurney law considers only the drift component of the current, which is driven by the electric field. It assumes that the current component arising from the charge concentration gradient (diffusion current) is negligible. Stating that the drift current is negligible is incorrect, as the SCLC is fundamentally a drift current.\n\nBased on these points:\n*   **A** is incorrect because the model is for a single-carrier device.\n*   **C** is incorrect because a Schottky contact is injection-limiting, whereas an Ohmic contact is required.\n*   **D** is incorrect because the model assumes drift current is dominant and diffusion current is negligible.\n\nTherefore, the Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a device with a single type of charge carrier, no traps, an Ohmic contact that provides a limitless supply of charge carriers without a barrier, and in which diffusion current is insignificant compared to drift current.\n\n<<<B>>>"
