    "To determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c, we will follow these steps:\n\n**1. Determine the rest mass of the Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li) nucleus.**\nThe nucleus in question is Lithium (Li) with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, which is an isotope known as Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li). According to the search results, the atomic mass of a $^{6}$Li atom is 6.015122 u. This mass includes its 3 electrons.\n\nTo find the nuclear mass, we must subtract the mass of the 3 electrons.\n*   Mass of $^{6}$Li atom: 6.015122 u\n*   Mass of an electron: 0.00054858 u\n\nMass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.00054858 u = 0.00164574 u\nRest mass of $^{6}$Li nucleus ($m_0$) = 6.015122 u - 0.00164574 u = 6.01347626 u\n\n**2. Convert the rest mass to energy units (GeV).**\nThe conversion factor from atomic mass units (u) to MeV/c² is approximately 931.5 MeV/c² per u. Therefore, in GeV/c², this is 0.9315 GeV/c² per u.\n\nRest energy ($E_0$) = $m_0 c^2$\n$E_0$ = 6.01347626 u * 0.9315 GeV/u\n$E_0$ ≈ 5.60155 GeV\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).**\nThe nucleus is traveling at a speed (v) of 0.96c. The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nGiven v = 0.96c, (v/c)² = 0.96² = 0.9216.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28}$\n$\\gamma \\approx 3.571428$\n\n**4. Calculate the total relativistic energy (E).**\nThe total energy is given by the equation $E = \\gamma E_0$.\n\nE = 3.571428 * 5.60155 GeV\nE ≈ 20.0055 GeV\n\nRounding the result, we get 20.006 GeV. Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 21.419 GeV\nC) 20.132 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.006 GeV is closest to 20.132 GeV. Let's re-evaluate using more precise constants.\n\n*   1 u = 931.4941 MeV/c² = 0.9314941 GeV/c²\n*   $m_0$ = 6.01347626 u\n\n$E_0$ = 6.01347626 u * 0.9314941 GeV/u ≈ 5.601509 GeV\nE = 3.57142857 * 5.601509 GeV ≈ 20.00539 GeV\n\nThe small difference could arise from the precise mass of the nucleus used. Some sources state the mass defect directly. For instance, the binding energy of the $^{6}$Li nucleus is 31.994 MeV. The total mass of 3 protons and 3 neutrons is:\n*   3 * (938.272 MeV/c²) + 3 * (939.565 MeV/c²) = 3 * (1877.837 MeV/c²) = 5633.511 MeV/c²\n*   Rest energy = 5633.511 MeV - 31.994 MeV = 5601.517 MeV = 5.601517 GeV\n\nE = 3.57142857 * 5.601517 GeV ≈ 20.0054 GeV\n\nAll calculations point to a value very close to 20 GeV. The option C) 20.132 GeV is the nearest choice. The discrepancy might be due to slightly different constants being used to generate the options. However, based on the calculation, C is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
