    "This question describes a nuclear decay analogous to double beta decay and asks for a comparison between the standard decay that emits neutrinos and a hypothetical variant that emits a single exotic massless particle.\n\n### Analysis of the Decay Processes\n\n1.  **Original Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n    This process is analogous to the observed two-neutrino double beta decay (`2νββ`), where two nucleons transform, emitting two electrons (E) and two antineutrinos (V). In such decays with multiple light particles in the final state, the released energy (the Q-value) is shared among them. The total energy of the two E particles is not fixed, resulting in a **continuous** energy spectrum. This spectrum extends from zero up to an endpoint.\n\n2.  **Variant Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`\n    In this version, the two V particles are replaced by a single exotic, massless particle, M. This scenario is analogous to models of neutrinoless double beta decay that include the emission of a Majoron, a hypothetical massless particle. In this case, the final state still contains more than two particles (the two E particles, the particle M, and the recoiling nucleus 2B). The decay energy must be distributed among these final state particles. Because energy can be shared in various proportions between the E particles and the M particle, the total energy spectrum of the two E particles **remains continuous**. The shape of the spectrum is altered compared to the `2νββ`-like decay, but it does not become a discrete line. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n### Comparing the Endpoint Energies\n\nThe endpoint of the energy spectrum corresponds to the maximum possible combined kinetic energy of the two E particles. This maximum value is the total energy released by the nuclear transformation (the Q-value) minus the energy converted into the rest mass of the emitted light particles.\n\nLet's denote the masses of the particles as `m_A`, `m_B`, `m_E`, `m_V`, and `m_M`. The Q-value represents the mass difference between the initial and final nuclei. This is the total kinetic energy available to be shared by the final particles.\n\n*   **Q-value for Original Decay (Q₁):** In this decay, two V particles are created. Neutrinos (V) have a small but non-zero rest mass. The total kinetic energy available is the mass difference minus the energy required to create the rest masses of the E and V particles.\n    `Q₁ = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V) * c²`\n\n*   **Q-value for Variant Decay (Q₂):** In this decay, one massless particle M is created (`m_M = 0`).\n    `Q₂ = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - m_M) * c² = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E) * c²`\n\n**Comparison:**\nSince neutrinos have mass (`m_V > 0`) and the exotic particle M is massless (`m_M = 0`), the term `2m_V*c²` is positive. Therefore, `Q₁` is less than `Q₂`.\n\n`Q₂ > Q₁`\n\nThe endpoint of the total energy spectrum for the E particles is determined by this available kinetic energy. Since more energy is available in the second process (as none is used to create the rest mass of the V particles), the endpoint of the spectrum for the E particles will be higher. The spectrum's peak also shifts to a higher energy compared to the original decay.\n\nThus, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\n<<<D>>>"
