    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nA key concept in calculating these potentials is the \"retarded time\" ($t_r$). Because electromagnetic effects propagate at the finite speed of light (c), the potential measured at a position $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* is determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, $t_r$. This time delay, $t - t_r$, is the time it takes for the field to travel the distance $\\vec{d}$ from the charge's past position to the observation point.\n\nThe correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    This can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by c:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n*   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    Similarly, this can be rewritten as:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions show that the potential is modified by a factor that depends on the velocity of the charge relative to the direction of observation. The two potentials are related by $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$, a relationship that holds for Liénard-Wiechert potentials when accounting for the full relativistic forms.\n\nComparing these derived formulas with the given options, we find that option D matches exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
