    "To determine how the number of stars changes with distance, we first need to understand the relationship between parallax and distance, and then apply the given information.\n\n### 1. Relationship Between Parallax and Distance\n\nStellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to a star. A parsec is defined as the distance at which a star would have a parallax of one arcsecond. This gives the simple and direct relationship:\n\n`r = 1 / plx` or `plx = 1 / r`\n\nHere, distance `r` is measured in parsecs and parallax `plx` is measured in arcseconds.\n\n### 2. Interpreting the Given Data\n\nThe problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\". In observational astronomy, this typically refers to the number of stars found within a specific range of parallax values, not the total cumulative number. This is a density function, which we can write as the derivative of the number of stars (N) with respect to parallax (plx):\n\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n\n### 3. Relating Star Counts per Parallax to Star Counts per Distance\n\nOur goal is to find how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance, which is represented by `dN/dr`. We can connect `dN/d(plx)` and `dN/dr` using the chain rule from calculus:\n\n`dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n\nWe already know `dN/d(plx)`. Now we need to find `d(plx)/dr`. Using the relationship `plx = 1/r`, we can calculate its derivative with respect to `r`:\n\n`d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\nFor proportionality, we are concerned with the magnitude, so `|d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r²`.\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nNow, substitute the proportionalities back into the chain rule equation:\n\n`dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * (|d(plx)/dr|)`\n`dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\nThis expression has both `plx` and `r`. To get the final relationship in terms of `r` only, we substitute `plx = 1/r` into the equation:\n\n`dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)`\n`dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n`dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance in that region of the sky changes in proportion to the cube of the distance.\n\n<<<D>>>"
