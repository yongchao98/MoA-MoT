    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unnamed white solid.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** A peak is observed at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+/(M+2) ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinct isotopic pattern indicating the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid that is dimerized through hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The integration of 1H confirms one such proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. This substitution pattern results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Its molecular weight is correct, but its ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex, showing three distinct signals in the aromatic region, not two doublets of two protons each. It also has an aldehyde proton, not a carboxylic acid proton.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MW:** 156.57 g/mol, consistent with the MS data.\n    *   **MS:** As a chlorinated compound, it would show the M+ and M+2 peaks in a ~3:1 ratio.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which matches the broad O-H and the C=O stretches.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The 1,4-disubstitution gives the characteristic pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region. The carboxylic acid proton signal is expected to be above 10 ppm. This structure perfectly matches all the given data.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound lacks a carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad O-H IR stretch or the carboxylic acid proton signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While this is a carboxylic acid with the correct molecular weight, its 1,2-disubstitution (ortho) would lead to a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four signals in the aromatic region, which contradicts the observed spectrum.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all spectral data, the evidence points conclusively to **4-chlorobenzoic acid** as the identity of the unknown substance.\n\n<<<B>>>"
