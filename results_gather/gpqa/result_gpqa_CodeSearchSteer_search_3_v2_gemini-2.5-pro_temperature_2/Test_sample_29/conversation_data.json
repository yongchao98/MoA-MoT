    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first calculate the wavelength and identify the color of the light it *emits*. We can then use the principles of fluorescence to find the color of the absorbed light.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light\nThe energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The relationship between energy (E) in electron-volts (eV) and wavelength (λ) in nanometers (nm) is given by the formula:\n\nλ (nm) = 1240 / E (eV)\n\nPlugging in the given energy value:\n\nλ = 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530.07 nm\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Color of Emitted Light\nA wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Color of Absorbed Light\nThis question involves the phenomenon of fluorescence, where a substance absorbs light at one wavelength and emits it at a longer, lower-energy wavelength. This difference between the absorption and emission wavelengths is known as the Stokes shift.\n\nAccording to the principle of Stokes shift, the energy of the absorbed light must be *higher* than the energy of the emitted light.\n\n*   **Emitted Light:** Energy = 2.3393 eV; Wavelength ≈ 530 nm (Green)\n*   **Absorbed Light:** Energy > 2.3393 eV; Wavelength < 530 nm\n\nNow, we examine the options provided:\n*   **D) Red:** Wavelength ~625–750 nm. This is a longer wavelength and lower energy than the emitted green light, which is not possible.\n*   **C) Yellow:** Wavelength ~570–590 nm. This is also a longer wavelength and lower energy, which is not possible.\n*   **B) Blue:** Wavelength ~450–495 nm. This is a shorter wavelength and thus higher energy than the emitted green light. This is a plausible option.\n*   **A) Violet:** Wavelength ~380–450 nm. This is also a shorter wavelength and higher energy. This is also a plausible option.\n\nSince the dye absorbs light to become excited and then emits green light (530 nm), it must have absorbed light of a shorter wavelength and higher energy. Both blue and violet fit this requirement. However, blue light is the next adjacent color in the spectrum with higher energy than green light. Therefore, for the dye to emit green light, it most likely absorbed blue light.\n\nFinal Answer Check: If the dye absorbs blue light, it will appear to be the complementary color, which is yellow or orange. When it fluoresces, it emits light at a longer wavelength than what it absorbed (blue), which is consistent with the emission of green light.\n\n<<<B>>>"
