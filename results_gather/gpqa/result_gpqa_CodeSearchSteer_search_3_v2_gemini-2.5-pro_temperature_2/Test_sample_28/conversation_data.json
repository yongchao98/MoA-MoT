    "To eliminate an anti-nutritional compound, the gene responsible for its synthesis must be inactivated. This is often achieved through a \"loss-of-function\" or \"knockout\" mutation. Let's analyze the provided mutations to see which is most likely to cause a complete loss of function.\n\nFirst, let's break down the intact gene's initial codons:\n*   **Intact gene:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT ... -3’\n*   **Amino acids:** Methionine (Start), Phenylalanine, Leucine, Alanine...\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’\n    *   This mutant changes the second codon from TTT to TTC and the third codon from CTC to TAC.\n    *   The change from TTT to TTC is a **silent mutation**; both codons specify the amino acid Phenylalanine.\n    *   The change from CTC (Leucine) to TAC (Tyrosine) is a **missense mutation**. This results in a single amino acid substitution. While a missense mutation *can* inactivate a protein, it often only alters its function or has no significant effect, making it less reliable for completely eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’\n    *   This mutant changes the third codon from CTC (Leucine) to **TAA**.\n    *   TAA is a **nonsense mutation**, also known as a stop codon. The presence of a premature stop codon signals for the termination of protein synthesis.\n    *   This will result in a severely truncated, incomplete protein, consisting of only two amino acids. Such a short protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT ... -3’\n    *   Comparing this sequence to the intact gene reveals a change in length and sequence that alters the triplet reading frame. This is characteristic of a **frameshift mutation**.\n    *   Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ... -3’\n    *   Mutant 3 appears to have an insertion, which would read something like: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT ... -3’. The specific changes are complex, but the result is a frameshift.\n    *   Frameshift mutations change every codon downstream from the mutation site. This leads to a completely different amino acid sequence and often introduces a premature stop codon by chance, resulting in a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGT...-3’\n    *   This sequence appears to have a deletion of a codon (in-frame deletion) as well as a missense mutation.\n    *   Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT **GGT** ACT TCT...\n    *   Mutant 4: ATG TTT TAC GCT --- ACT TCT...\n    *   This creates a protein that is missing one amino acid (Glycine) and has another substituted (Leucine to Tyrosine). Like a missense mutation, this might inactivate the protein, but it is not as certain as a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth frameshift (Mutant 3) and nonsense mutations (Mutant 2) are very likely to eliminate the protein's function. However, a nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of a protein sequence (the third codon, in this case) is an extremely clear and definitive way to ensure a non-functional product is created. It halts protein synthesis almost immediately. For this reason, it is the most probable mutation to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<B>>>"
