    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\nFirst, we determine the uncertainty in the electron's momentum (Δp) using the uncertainty in its position (Δx). The relationship is given by:\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nWhere:\n*   **Δx** is the uncertainty in position = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n*   **Δp** is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\nTo find the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nNext, we relate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). For a particle moving at a relativistic speed (v), the relationship between energy and momentum uncertainty is:\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\nGiven:\n*   **v** (speed of the electron) = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   **Δp** (calculated uncertainty in momentum) ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nNow we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy:\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis value is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<D>>>"
