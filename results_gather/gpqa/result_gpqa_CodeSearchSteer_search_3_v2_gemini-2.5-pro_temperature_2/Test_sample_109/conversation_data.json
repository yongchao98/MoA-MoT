    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars are detectable by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine Observability Criteria**\n\nFor a star to be detectable by both observatories, it must meet two conditions: it must be bright enough for both instruments, and it must be located in a part of the sky visible from both observatory locations.\n\n*   **Magnitude Limit:**\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than an apparent V magnitude of 17.\n    *   HIRES can observe stars brighter than an apparent V magnitude of 16.\n    *   Therefore, to be observed by **both**, a star must have an apparent V magnitude **brighter than 16 mag**.\n\n*   **Visibility (Declination) Limit:**\n    *   Paranal Observatory, home to ESPRESSO, is in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of about -24.6 degrees.\n    *   W. M. Keck Observatory, home to HIRES, is in the Northern Hemisphere at a latitude of about +19.8 degrees.\n    *   A star's declination (DEC) determines its visibility. For a star to be visible from both hemispheres, its declination must be in the overlapping range observable from both sites. This generally means a declination between approximately -65 and +70 degrees. The prompt asks to disregard pointing limits, which is taken to mean we only need to check if the star is fundamentally visible from both latitudes, not whether it can be pointed at on a specific night or time.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Each Star**\n\nThe observed apparent magnitude (`m_V`) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (`M_V`) and distance (`d`) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5*log10(d/10)`. If there is interstellar dust, its absorption effect (`A_V`) must also be added. `A_V` is calculated from the color excess, `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`. The apparent magnitude in astronomy generally refers to the final, observed brightness after all effects like distance and dust absorption.\n\n---\n\n**Star 1**\n*   **DEC = -75 deg**: This declination is too far south to be visible from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii (Northern Hemisphere).\n*   ***Conclusion: Not observable by both.***\n\n---\n\n**Star 2**\n*   **DEC = 55 deg**: This is visible from both Paranal and Keck.\n*   **Apparent V magnitude = 16.5 mag**: This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag.\n*   ***Conclusion: Not observable by both.***\n\n---\n\n**Star 3**\n*   **DEC = 48 deg**: This is visible from both Paranal and Keck.\n*   **Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 mag**: This is brighter than the limit of 16 mag. In this context, the provided apparent magnitude is the final observed value. The color excess information (`E(B-V)`) is additional data not needed to establish the observed brightness.\n*   ***Conclusion: Observable by both.***\n\n---\n\n**Star 4**\n*   **DEC = -48 deg**: This is visible from both Paranal and Keck.\n*   **Magnitude Calculation**: We must calculate the apparent magnitude from the given absolute magnitude, distance, and extinction.\n    *   Absorption (`A_V`) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   Apparent magnitude (`m_V`) = M_V + 5*log10(d/10pc) + A_V\n    *   `m_V` = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**.\n*   This apparent magnitude of 16.74 is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag.\n*   ***Conclusion: Not observable by both.***\n\n---\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **DEC = 60 deg**: This is visible from both Paranal and Keck.\n*   **Magnitude Calculation**: We must calculate the apparent magnitude from the given absolute magnitude and distance.\n    *   Apparent magnitude (`m_V`) = M_V + 5*log10(d/10pc)\n    *   `m_V` = 16.5 + 5*log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = **14.995 mag**.\n*   This apparent magnitude of ~15.0 is brighter than the limit of 16 mag.\n*   ***Conclusion: Observable by both.***\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for observation with both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n<<<A>>>"
