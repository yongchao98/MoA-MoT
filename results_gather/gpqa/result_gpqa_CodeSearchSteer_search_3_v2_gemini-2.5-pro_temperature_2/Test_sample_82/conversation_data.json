    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both stages of the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.02000 L\n    Concentration = 0.05 M\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Total volume after dilution:**\n    Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   **Concentration of diluted acetic acid:**\n    Concentration = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (a weak acid) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by the strong base NaOH. This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n*   **The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**\n    pH = pKa + log ( [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] )\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Determine the ratio of conjugate base to acid:**\n    At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has become conjugate base, and 75% remains as acid.\n    Ratio = [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n    Rounded to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains only the conjugate base, acetate, which will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:**\n    Moles of NaOH needed = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol\n    Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume at the equivalence point:**\n    Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]) at the equivalence point:**\n    Concentration = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    The acetate ion reacts with water in an equilibrium:\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Calculate Kb for acetate:**\n    Kb = Kw / Ka (where Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C)\n    Kb = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:**\n    We can set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can simplify this to: 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² = (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n    Rounded to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<C>>>"
