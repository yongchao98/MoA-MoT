    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. To solve it, we must calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame, which will be different from the time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame.\n\nHere is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames and given information:**\n    *   The Galaxy is the stationary reference frame (S).\n    *   The supernova ejecta is the moving reference frame (S').\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (the proper time) is `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the time in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt):**\n    Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy frame will measure a longer time interval than an observer in the ejecta's frame. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor, γ (gamma), is calculated using the formula: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`.\n\n    Now, substitute this value into the Lorentz factor equation:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`.\n    `γ ≈ 1.02062`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the dilated time (Δt):**\n    Now, use the Lorentz factor to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d):**\n    The distance traveled is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame:\n    `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated distance of approximately 3,061,860 km is very close to option B.\n\n    *Note on approximation:* Often in such problems, a binomial approximation for the Lorentz factor is used for low velocities: `γ ≈ 1 + v²/(2c²)`.\n    `γ ≈ 1 + (0.2)²/2 = 1 + 0.04/2 = 1.02`.\n    Using this approximated gamma: `d = v * γ * Δt' = 60,000 km/s * 1.02 * 50 s = 3,060,000 km`.\n    This result exactly matches option B, suggesting this approximation was likely intended in the problem's design.\n\nBased on the calculation, the correct answer is 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>"
