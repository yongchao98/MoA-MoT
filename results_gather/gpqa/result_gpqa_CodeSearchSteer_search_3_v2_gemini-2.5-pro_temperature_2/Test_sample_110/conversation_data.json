    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one acts as the Michael donor after being deprotonated by a base. Ethyl acrylate is the Michael acceptor, an α,β-unsaturated ester. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile)**: The base, t-BuOK, will remove an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate. The starting ketone has two α-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no protons.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one proton.\n    Therefore, the only possible enolate is formed by deprotonating C6. The steric bulk of t-BuOK favors the formation of the less substituted (kinetic) enolate, but in this case, it is the only one that can be formed.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate nucleophile attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (H₂C=CH-COOEt). This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n4.  **Protonation**: The resulting intermediate is protonated during the workup step to yield the final product.\n5.  **Structure of Product A**: The final product is 2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. To match this with the provided options, we must name it as a substituted ethyl propanoate. In this nomenclature, the cyclohexyl group is a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is C6 of the original cyclohexanone. As per IUPAC rules, this carbon is numbered C1' of the substituent group.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at C2' (relative to C1').\n    *   An ethyl group and a methyl group are at C3' (relative to C1').\n    *   Another methyl group is at C1' (the former C6).\n    *   Putting it together, the substituent name is **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. 1-nitropropane is the Michael donor, and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile) is the Michael acceptor. KOH is the base, and water is the proton source.\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile**: KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂), which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group, forming a nitronate anion.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n4.  **Protonation**: The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n5.  **Structure of Product B**: The product structure is CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN. To name this according to IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The carbon of the nitrile group is designated as C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 has six carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   There is a methyl substituent at C3 and a nitro substituent at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A**: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B**: 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these products with the given options, we find that option B correctly identifies both major products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
