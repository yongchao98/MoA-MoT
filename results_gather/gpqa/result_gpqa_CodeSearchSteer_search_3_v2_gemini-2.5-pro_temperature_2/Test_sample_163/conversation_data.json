    "My initial reasoning and calculation were based on the formula M_total ∝ P * (K_total)^3, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law for a double-lined spectroscopic binary. The search results confirm this relationship. Specifically, for a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass (M1 + M2) can be determined if the inclination angle `i` is known. The formula is (M1 + M2) = (P * (v1+v2)^3) / (2πG), where v are the orbital velocities. Since the observed quantities are the radial velocities K = v * sin(i), the formula involving observable quantities becomes (M1 + M2)sin³i = (P * (K1+K2)³) / (2πG).\n\nThe crucial information in the problem is that both systems are \"eclipsing\". For an eclipse to occur, the observer's line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the binary system. This means the inclination angle `i` must be close to 90 degrees, and therefore sin(i) ≈ 1. Assuming sin(i) is approximately 1 for both systems allows for a direct comparison of their masses.\n\nWith sin³(i) ≈ 1, the formula simplifies to M_total ≈ (P * (K1+K2)³) / (2πG).\nThe ratio of the masses of the two systems is therefore:\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\nNow, I will re-calculate using the given values:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period P1 = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes K1_total = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period P2 = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes K2_total = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**Ratio calculation:**\nM1 / M2 = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)\nM1 / M2 = (2 * 3375) / (15625)\nM1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is closest to the option A) ~ 0.4.\n\nThe steps and the underlying formula are sound and confirmed by the search results. The key assumption of sin(i)≈1 is justified by the fact that these are eclipsing binaries. The calculation is straightforward. No further information is needed.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\nRatio = 2 * (15/25)³ = 2 * (3/5)³ = 2 * (27/125) = 54/125 = 0.432.\nThe calculation is correct.\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This translates to the ratio M1/M2.\nThe calculated ratio is ~0.432, which is best approximated by 0.4.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the formula for the total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary, which relates the mass to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K).\n\nFor a binary system with components of mass M1 and M2, the total mass can be expressed as:\n(M1 + M2) sin³(i) = [P / (2πG)] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n*   i is the orbital inclination (the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky).\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This is a key piece of information, as eclipses are only observed when the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. When i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass equation to:\nM_total = M1 + M2 ≈ [P / (2πG)] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nThis shows that the total mass of the system is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (M ∝ P * (K1+K2)³).\n\nWe can now calculate this value for each system and then find their ratio.\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Period P1 = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   M1 ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Period P2 = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   M2 ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the mass of system_1 to the mass of system_2:\nRatio = M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can express it as:\nRatio = (2 * 15³) / (1 * 25³) = 2 * (15/25)³ = 2 * (3/5)³\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125) = 54 / 125\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
