    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the hypothetical scenario to determine the flux ratio.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State of Solar Neutrinos\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction branches in its core. The key sources relevant to the energy bands in question (700-900 keV) are:\n*   **pp-II Branch**: Produces mono-energetic neutrinos from ⁷Be electron capture at 861 keV. This is a very strong, distinct line in the solar neutrino spectrum.\n*   **pp-III Branch**: Produces neutrinos from the beta decay of ⁸B. These neutrinos have a continuous energy spectrum that extends up to about 15 MeV. This source contributes a small but significant flux across both energy bands in the question.\n*   **CNO Cycle**: These reactions (involving Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen) produce neutrinos from the decays of ¹³N and ¹⁵O, which have continuous energy spectra. They also contribute a small flux to both energy bands.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Hypothetical Change\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**.\n*   This means the production of neutrinos from **⁸B decay ceases immediately**.\n*   Crucially, the prompt specifies that all other reactions, including the pp-II branch and the CNO cycle, **continue as normal**.\n*   The 8.5-minute time delay mentioned is the approximate travel time for neutrinos from the Sun to Earth, meaning we are observing the immediate effect of this change.\n\n### 3. Calculating the New Flux in Each Band\n\nWe need to assess what neutrino sources are left contributing to the two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   Initially, this band contained a mix of neutrinos from the continuous spectra of ⁸B and the CNO cycle.\n    *   After the pp-III branch stops, the ⁸B neutrino contribution disappears.\n    *   Therefore, the only remaining source in this band is the CNO cycle neutrinos. This results in a very small total flux.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   This band contains the extremely strong and sharp 861 keV line from ⁷Be neutrinos (produced by the unaffected pp-II branch).\n    *   This band also contains minor contributions from the continuous spectra of the CNO cycle and, initially, the ⁸B neutrinos.\n    *   After the pp-III branch stops, the small contribution from ⁸B neutrinos vanishes.\n    *   However, the flux in this band remains completely dominated by the massive flux from the ⁷Be neutrino line, which is unaffected by the change. The total flux of ⁷Be neutrinos is orders of magnitude greater than the flux from the CNO cycle or the original ⁸B neutrinos in this region. For example, the total flux from ⁷Be is about 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s, while the total flux from ⁸B is about 5 x 10⁶ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n\n### 4. Determining the Ratio\n\nWe now compare the flux in the two bands after the change:\n\n*   **Flux (Band 1)** = A small contribution from the CNO cycle.\n*   **Flux (Band 2)** = An enormous contribution from ⁷Be neutrinos, plus a small contribution from the CNO cycle.\n\nThe ratio is therefore:\n\n`Flux (700-800 keV) / Flux (800-900 keV) ≈ (Small CNO Flux) / (Huge ⁷Be Flux)`\n\nSince the flux from ⁷Be in the second band is vastly larger than the remaining CNO flux in the first band, the ratio will be a very small number, much less than 1. Looking at a detailed solar neutrino spectrum, the flux density from continuous sources (like CNO and ⁸B) is roughly 10³ to 10⁵ units, whereas the integrated flux from the ⁷Be line is around 5 x 10⁹ units.\n\nThe ratio of the CNO flux in the first band to the total flux in the second (dominated by ⁷Be) is on the order of 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁶. Among the given options, the one that best represents a small, but not infinitesimally small, ratio is 0.01. This suggests we should compare the flux densities of the continuous spectra that are left.\n\nLet's re-evaluate by comparing the flux densities of what's left:\n*   **Flux density in Band 1** is from the continuous CNO spectrum.\n*   **Flux density in Band 2** contains the monoenergetic ⁷Be line. If we compare only the continuous backgrounds, the CNO flux density in Band 1 is roughly equal to the CNO flux density in Band 2. However, the presence of the ⁷Be line flux cannot be ignored as it is what a detector would see.\n\nGiven the overwhelming dominance of the ⁷Be line in Band 2 and its complete absence in Band 1, the ratio of total fluxes will be very small.\n\nLet's carefully consider the flux of just the continuous background sources that are active in both bands *before* the change (CNO + ⁸B) and what's left *after* (just CNO). The flux density of CNO neutrinos is roughly 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the ⁸B flux density in this energy range. By removing the ⁸B component, the remaining CNO flux in Band 1 is now compared to the sum of CNO and the still-present, enormous ⁷Be flux in Band 2. The closest numerical answer reflecting \"very small\" is 0.01.\n\n<<<B>>>"
