    "### Calculation of the Photon Momentum\n\nTo determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first calculate the energy difference (ΔE) between the initial and final states of the molecule. The photon's momentum (p) is then found using the relation p = ΔE/c, where c is the speed of light.\n\nThe molecule is described by the non-rigid rotor model, where its energy is the sum of vibrational and rotational energies:\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B J(J + 1)\n\n*   **v** is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **J** is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **ω** is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   **B** is the rotational constant.\n\n**1. Initial and Final States:**\n*   The molecule is initially in its **fundamental state**, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to v = 0 and J = 0.\n*   The photon absorption causes the molecule to transition to the **next state with the lowest possible energy**. According to the selection rules for rovibrational transitions, for an absorption event, the change in quantum numbers must be Δv = +1 and ΔJ = +1.\n*   Therefore, the initial state is (v=0, J=0) and the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n\n**2. Energy of the Transition (ΔE):**\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between the final and initial state energies:\nΔE = E(v=1, J=1) - E(v=0, J=0)\nΔE = [ ħω(1 + 1/2) + B(1)(1+1) ] - [ ħω(0 + 1/2) + B(0)(0+1) ]\nΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n\n**3. Calculating the Rotational Constant (B):**\nThe rotational constant B is given by B = ħ² / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia. For a diatomic molecule, I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass and R is the bond length.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\n    Converting to kilograms (1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg):\n    μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR²\n    Given R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    I ≈ (3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n    Using ħ ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    B = ħ² / (2I)\n    B ≈ (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n    B ≈ 4.604 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Energy (ΔE):**\nNow, we calculate the two parts of the energy transition:\n*   **Vibrational part:** ΔE_vib = ħω\n    ΔE_vib ≈ (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   **Rotational part:** ΔE_rot = 2B\n    ΔE_rot ≈ 2 * (4.604 x 10⁻²³ J) = 9.208 x 10⁻²³ J\n\nTotal energy:\nΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot\nΔE ≈ 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.009208 x 10⁻²⁰ J\nΔE ≈ 4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n**5. Calculating the Photon Momentum (p):**\nFinally, we calculate the photon's momentum:\np = ΔE / c\nUsing c ≈ 2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s\np ≈ (4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value is very close to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
