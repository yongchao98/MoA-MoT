    "### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data and Candidate Compounds\n\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, we must analyze the expected ¹H NMR spectrum for each option and compare it to the data provided for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n**Given Spectral Data:**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets at ~6.7 ppm with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets at ~2.2 ppm with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄ for both compounds. All listed options satisfy this.\n\nThe presence of two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 mixture strongly suggests that each compound contributes one aromatic singlet. This means we are looking for two molecules that each have only one type of aromatic proton due to symmetry.\n\n### Evaluating Each Compound's Predicted ¹H NMR Spectrum:\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This results in **one singlet** in the aromatic region, integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This gives **one singlet** in the alkyl region, integrating to 12H.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the molecule between C1-C2 and C3-C4.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This results in **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H total), and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H total). This gives **two singlets** in the alkyl region, each with a 6H integration (a 1:1 ratio between them).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry that would make the aromatic protons equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 is between two methyl groups, while the proton at C6 is adjacent to one methyl group and one proton. They are chemically different. This would result in **two separate singlets** in the aromatic region. This compound alone does not match the criteria of contributing only one singlet.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** It would exhibit four distinct singlets for each of the four non-equivalent methyl groups.\n\n4.  **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry, with a plane through the two ethyl groups and a perpendicular plane.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent, which would produce **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signals would not be singlets. Each ethyl group would produce a **quartet** (for the -CH₂-) and a **triplet** (for the -CH₃-). This contradicts the data stating there are only three singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### Analyzing the Mixture\n\nBased on the individual analyses, the only two compounds that each produce a single aromatic singlet are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the alkyl region data.\n\n*   **Compound A: 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aromatic signal: 1 singlet (from 2H)\n    *   Alkyl signal: 1 singlet (from 12H)\n*   **Compound B: 1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aromatic signal: 1 singlet (from 2H)\n    *   Alkyl signals: 2 singlets (each from 6H)\n\n**In a 1:1 mixture:**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** We would see the singlet from compound A and the singlet from compound B. Since both signals originate from 2 protons and the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the two singlets would have a **1:1 integral ratio**. This matches the experimental data.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** We would see three singlets in total:\n    *   One singlet from all 12 methyl protons of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   A second singlet from the 6 protons of the C1/C4 methyl groups of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   A third singlet from the 6 protons of the C2/C3 methyl groups of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   The integration ratio of these three signals would be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
