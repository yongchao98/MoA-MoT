    "This is a multi-step synthesis problem that requires deduction of the intermediates to determine the structure of the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Analysis of Product 1**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n    *   **Reaction:** Heated to 240°C with excess KOH.\n    *   **Product 1 Data:** Ketone (IR: 1720 cm⁻¹), 14 protons in the NMR.\n    *   **Analysis:** The conditions are harsh and while the provided NMR data for product 1 is unusual and points to a very specific, highly symmetrical rearranged product, a known reaction pathway for adamantane derivatives under these types of conditions involves skeletal rearrangement. A plausible, known transformation for adamantane halides is rearrangement to a protoadamantane structure. Let's assume **Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one**. The unusual NMR data in the prompt may be a simplified representation or a red herring.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Analysis of Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n    *   **Analysis:** This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. The term \"heated with\" suggests that after the reduction of the ketone to the corresponding alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol), a subsequent dehydration reaction may occur, catalyzed by the Lewis-acidic aluminum species. Dehydration of the alcohol would form an alkene. Therefore, **Product 2 is protoadamant-4-ene** (a C=C double bond is formed in the protoadamantane skeleton). The presence of a double bond is required for the next step.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Analysis of Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup, which cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond and converts the two carbons of the double bond into carbonyl groups. Since Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) has a C=C bond where both carbons are attached to a hydrogen, the product will be a dialdehyde. The ozonolysis of protoadamant-4-ene is known to cleave the cage structure, yielding **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n4.  **NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n    *   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde. This molecule has a high degree of symmetry, often adopting a \"double chair\" conformation.\n    *   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded protons in this molecule are the aldehyde protons (-CHO), which typically appear at δ 9-10 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Pattern:** We need to determine the splitting pattern of this aldehyde proton. Let's consider the aldehyde proton at position 3 (Hₐ).\n        *   **3-Bond Coupling (³J):** Hₐ is coupled to the single proton on the carbon it's attached to (H3). This coupling will split the signal into a **doublet**.\n        *   **Long-Range Coupling (⁴J):** In rigid bicyclic systems like this, long-range coupling over four bonds is common, especially through a \"W\" shaped pathway. The aldehyde proton Hₐ can couple to the protons on the adjacent methylene groups (C2 and C4). Due to the molecule's symmetry (a C₂ axis or a C₃-C₉-C₇ plane), the two axial protons on C2 and C4 are chemically equivalent. Likewise, the two equatorial protons are equivalent. It is plausible that Hₐ experiences significant coupling to one of these pairs of equivalent protons (e.g., the axial pair H2ₐₓ and H4ₐₓ), which would split the signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   **Combined Pattern:** When these couplings are combined, the signal for the aldehyde proton is split into a doublet by H3, and each line of the doublet is further split into a triplet by the two equivalent long-range coupled protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a doublet of triplets.\n\n<<<D>>>"
