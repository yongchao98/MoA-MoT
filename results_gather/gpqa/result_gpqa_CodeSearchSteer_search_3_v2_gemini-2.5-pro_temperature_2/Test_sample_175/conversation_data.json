    "To determine the probability of sequentially measuring 0 for observable P and then -1 for observable Q, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics for measurement. This involves a multi-step calculation: first, determining the probability of the initial measurement and the subsequent \"collapse\" of the quantum state, and second, calculating the probability of the second measurement on this new state.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Normalize the Initial State**: The initial state of the system is given by the unnormalized column matrix `ψ = [-1, 2, 1]`. To use this in probability calculations, it must be normalized. The squared norm of the state is `||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`. The normalized state `|ψ⟩` is thus `(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`.\n\n2.  **Find the Eigenstate for P = 0**: The measurement of observable P yielding a result of 0 means the system must be in the eigenstate of the operator P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. We find this by solving the eigenvalue equation `P|v⟩ = λ|v⟩` for `λ = 0`. The eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is found to be `(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`. Let's call this state `|p₀⟩`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Measuring P = 0**: The probability of measuring P=0 is found by projecting the initial state `|ψ⟩` onto the eigenstate `|p₀⟩` and squaring the magnitude of the result. The probability, `Prob(P=0)`, is given by `|⟨p₀|ψ⟩|²`.\n    *   The inner product is `⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] · (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1] = (1/√12) * (-1 + 0 - 1) = -2/√12 = -1/√3`.\n    *   The probability is `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n\n4.  **State Collapse**: After measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the system's state collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenstate `|p₀⟩`. The new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is now `|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n\n5.  **Find the Eigenstate for Q = -1**: The operator Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue -1 is `|q₋₁⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q = -1**: Now, we calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1 from the collapsed state `|ψ'⟩`. This probability, `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`, is `|⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²`.\n    *   The inner product is `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] · (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] = (1/√2) * (0 + 0 - 1) = -1/√2`.\n    *   The probability is `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Probability**: The total probability for this sequence of measurements is the product of the individual probabilities.\n    *   `Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\nThus, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
