    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Here is a breakdown of how the data supports this conclusion:\n\n### **1. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are highly characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) group**. Primary amines typically show two distinct bands in this region.\n*   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. Specifically, it is consistent with an α,β-unsaturated ester, such as an ester conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H)**: This combination of a triplet and a downfield quartet is a classic signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)** attached to an electron-withdrawing atom, in this case, the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). The quartet's significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is characteristic for the methylene protons of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)**: This signal indicates two protons in a similar chemical environment. Its broadness is typical for the exchangeable protons of an **amine (-NH₂) group**. The chemical shift is appropriate for an amine attached to an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)**: This pattern in the aromatic region strongly suggests a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the two more deshielded protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group. This specific splitting and the opposing electronic nature of the substituents perfectly match the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Possible Structures:**\n\n*   **A) Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The molecular formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂) is correct. The structure contains a primary amine, a para-disubstituted benzene ring, and an ethyl ester group. All these features are perfectly consistent with the provided IR and ¹H NMR data.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This would have a more complex aromatic NMR signal (not two doublets) and the IR peak for an amide C=O is typically at a lower wavenumber than 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** While an ester, the ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl carbon. Its protons would appear much more upfield (around 2-2.5 ppm) and would not be split into a quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H proton and a single N-H stretch in the IR spectrum. It would also feature a very downfield singlet for the formyl proton (-CHO).\n\n**Conclusion:** All spectroscopic evidence points unequivocally to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct structure.\n\n<<<A>>>"
