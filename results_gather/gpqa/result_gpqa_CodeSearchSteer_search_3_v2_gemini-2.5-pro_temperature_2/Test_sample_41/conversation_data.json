    "The search results confirm my reasoning.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is reached when the energy absorbed from the star balances the energy radiated by the planet. The key relationship for this problem is how temperature depends on the distance from the star. The planet's temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star. This can be written as T_eq ∝ 1 / √a, where 'a' is the semi-major axis (orbital distance). This confirms my derived relationship T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2). The other factors like star luminosity and albedo cancel out when taking ratios, as they are constant for this system.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). This is stated as P² ∝ a³. This confirms the second major formula I used.\n\nThe calculations based on these confirmed principles should be correct.\n\n**Step 1: Relate semi-major axis to equilibrium temperature.**\nFrom T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2), we can write a ∝ 1 / T_eq².\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet 3 and Planet 1 is:\na₃/a₁ = (T_eq₁/T_eq₃)²\n\n**Step 2: Find the temperature ratio T_eq₁/T_eq₃.**\nWe are given:\nT_eq₁ / T_eq₂ = 1.4\nT_eq₂ / T_eq₃ = 2.3\nSo, T_eq₁ / T_eq₃ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂) * (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the semi-major axis ratio.**\na₃/a₁ = (3.22)² = 10.3684\n\n**Step 4: Relate orbital period to semi-major axis.**\nFrom Kepler's Third Law, P² ∝ a³, which means P ∝ a^(3/2).\nTherefore, the ratio of the orbital periods is:\nP₃/P₁ = (a₃/a₁)^(3/2)\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the orbital period ratio.**\nP₃/P₁ = (10.3684)^(3/2)\nP₃/P₁ = ((3.22)²)^(3/2)\nP₃/P₁ = (3.22)³\nP₃/P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThe additional information (TTV method, mass ratios, specific albedo value) is confirmed to be extraneous to the core calculation. The problem boils down to applying the formula for equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law. The calculation is robust. The answer is C.\n\nFinal check of the options.\nA) ~ 3.2 (This is just the temperature ratio T₁/T₃)\nB) ~ 10.4 (This is the semi-major axis ratio a₃/a₁)\nC) ~ 33.4 (This is the result of (a₃/a₁)^(3/2))\nD) ~ 4.4 (This doesn't seem to correspond to any simple intermediate calculation)\n\nThe options seem designed to catch common errors, such as stopping at an intermediate step. My full calculation leads directly to option C. To provide a definitive answer to the user, the step-by-step derivation will be presented clearly.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to combine the principles of thermal equilibrium for a planet and Kepler's Third Law of orbital motion. The information about the masses and the TTV discovery method is not needed for this calculation.\n\n**1. Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For a planet in a circular orbit, this temperature is related to its distance (semi-major axis, *a*) from the star. The energy received is proportional to 1/a², and the temperature is proportional to the fourth root of the energy flux. This leads to the relationship:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/√a\n\nThis means the square of the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the orbital distance:\n\na ∝ 1/T_eq²\n\n**2. Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances**\n\nWe are given the temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq₁ / T_eq₂ = 1.4\n*   T_eq₂ / T_eq₃ = 2.3\n\nWe need the ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3, which can be found by multiplying the given ratios:\nT_eq₁ / T_eq₃ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂) * (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of their orbital distances (a₃/a₁):\na₃ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)² = (3.22)² ≈ 10.37\n\n**3. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\nP² ∝ a³\n\nThis can be written as a ratio:\n(P₃ / P₁)² = (a₃ / a₁)²\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n\nNow, we substitute the value of the semi-major axis ratio into the equation from Kepler's law:\n(P₃ / P₁)² = (10.37)³ ≈ 1115.3\nP₃ / P₁ = √1115.3 ≈ 33.4\n\nAlternatively, we can combine the expressions:\nP₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2) = ((T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)²)^(3/2) = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)³\nP₃ / P₁ = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.39\n\nThe orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
