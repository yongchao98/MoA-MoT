    "In a hypothetical universe where magnetic monopoles—isolated north or south poles—exist, two of the fundamental laws of electromagnetism known as Maxwell's equations would be altered. These equations describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields.\n\nThe two equations that would be different are:\n\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇ ⋅ B) is zero. This is a mathematical expression of the observation that there are no magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles did exist, this law would be modified to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the density of magnetic charge (ρm), much like how the divergence of the electric field is proportional to electric charge density.\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇ × E). In a universe with magnetic monopoles, a moving magnetic charge would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). This magnetic current would act as another source for the electric field, adding a new term to Faraday's Law. Therefore, the equation related to the circulation (or curl) of the electric field would change.\n\nThe other two of Maxwell's equations would remain the same in their fundamental form. Gauss's law for electricity, which relates the electric field to electric charges, and the Ampère-Maxwell law, which describes how electric currents and changing electric fields create magnetic fields, would not be directly altered by the existence of static magnetic charges.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the equations related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field would be different.\n\n<<<C>>>"
