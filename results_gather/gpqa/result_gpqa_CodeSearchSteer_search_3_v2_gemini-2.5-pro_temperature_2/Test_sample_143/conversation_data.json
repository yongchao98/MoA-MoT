    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n**1. Understand the Relationship between Decay Width and Mean Lifetime**\n\nThe decay width (Γ) of a particle is inversely proportional to its mean lifetime (τ). This relationship is a consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and is given by the formula:\nτ = ħ / Γ\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**2. Calculate the Mean Lifetime (τ)**\n\nFirst, ensure all units are consistent. Let's work with Mega-electron volts (MeV) and seconds.\n*   Given decay width Γ_X = 320 MeV.\n*   The value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s.\n\nNow, we can calculate the mean lifetime τ:\nτ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV\nτ ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n**3. Determine the Relativistic Factor (γβ)**\n\nThe mean decay distance must be calculated in the laboratory frame. Due to relativistic effects, the particle's lifetime is dilated in the lab frame. The distance it travels is given by L = vγτ = βcγτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor and β is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light (c).\n\nThe Lorentz factor γ can be calculated from the particle's total energy (E_X) and mass (m_X):\nγ = E_X / m_X\n\nLet's convert the energy and mass to the same units (GeV):\n*   E_X = 8 GeV\n*   m_X = 1.2 GeV\n\nγ = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3 ≈ 6.667\n\nThe term γβ is needed for the decay distance calculation and can be found using the relation γ² = 1 / (1 - β²), which implies (γβ)² = γ² - 1.\nγβ = sqrt(γ² - 1)\nγβ = sqrt((20/3)² - 1) = sqrt(400/9 - 1) = sqrt(391/9)\nγβ ≈ 6.591\n\n**4. Calculate the Mean Decay Distance (L)**\n\nNow, we can compute the mean decay distance using the formula L = γβ * c * τ.\n*   γβ ≈ 6.591\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   τ ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\nL ≈ 6.591 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nL ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nAlternatively, a more direct calculation can be done using the value of ħc:\nL = γβ * c * (ħ / Γ_X) = (γβ * ħc) / Γ_X\nUsing ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm:\nL = (sqrt(391/9) * 197.3 MeV·fm) / 320 MeV\nL ≈ (6.591 * 197.3 fm) / 320\nL ≈ 1300.2 fm / 320\nL ≈ 4.063 fm\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m, L ≈ 4.063 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\nBoth calculation methods yield a result that is extremely close to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
