    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, a key concept in Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference**:\n    *   **S frame**: The laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest.\n    *   **S' frame**: The rest frame of the moving glass.\n\n2.  **Define the velocities**:\n    *   **v**: The velocity of the glass (S' frame) relative to the laboratory (S frame).\n    *   **u'**: The speed of light within the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame (S' frame). This is determined by the index of refraction, `n`. The speed of light in a medium is `c/n`. Since the problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`. The beam and the glass are moving in the same direction.\n    *   **u**: The speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S frame). This is the value we need to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the Einstein velocity-addition formula**:\n    For collinear motion, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the specific values from the problem into the formula**:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    This gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression**:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\nThis result matches the expression in option B. This effect, where the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple sum of the medium's speed and the speed of light within it, was famously observed in the Fizeau experiment. Max von Laue later showed that this result is a natural consequence of the relativistic velocity-addition formula.\n\n<<<B>>>"
