    "The problem describes a series of chemical reactions involving an unknown substance, X, and asks for the sum of the atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest constituent elements. A step-by-step analysis of the provided clues allows for the identification of Substance X.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance B:**\nThe melting point of substance B is stated to be \"very close to 277 K\". This is equivalent to approximately 4 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), which is a very close match. In contrast, normal water (H₂O) melts at 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly suggests that substance B is heavy water.\n\n**2. Identification of Precipitate G:**\nPrecipitate G releases substance B (D₂O) when heated. This indicates that G is a deuterated hydroxide compound that decomposes upon heating to form a metal oxide and D₂O. For example, aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, decomposes on heating to produce aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) and water (H₂O). Therefore, G is likely aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃.\n\n**3. Identification of Substance X and Liquid Y:**\nSubstance X reacts violently with liquid Y, forming precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) and a gas W. The formation of an aluminum-containing precipitate points to X containing aluminum. The presence of deuterium in the products (D₂O and Al(OD)₃) implies that either X or Y, or both, contain deuterium.\n\nA well-known violent reaction in organic chemistry is that of lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) with water. Its \"very close analog\" which incorporates a \"heavier isotope\" of hydrogen is lithium aluminum deuteride, LiAlD₄. This makes LiAlD₄ a prime candidate for Substance X. If X is LiAlD₄, then its violent reaction with liquid Y to produce D₂ and Al(OD)₃ would be logical if Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n\nThe reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4 D₂ (gas W).\n\n**4. Identification of Gas W:**\nThe gas W produced has a molecule containing an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's check if D₂ fits this description. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, satisfying the condition.\n\n**5. Corroborating Clues:**\n*   **Organic Chemistry Reagent:** LiAlH₄ (the analog of X) and by extension LiAlD₄, are powerful reducing agents widely used in organic chemistry.\n*   **Keto Acid Reaction:** LiAlH₄ is strong enough to reduce both the keto group and the carboxylic acid group of a keto acid. For example, the reduction of a beta-keto acid would yield a diol, a product which could fit the description of containing two oxygen atoms.\n\nBased on this evidence, Substance X is confidently identified as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Calculation:**\nThe final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in LiAlD₄. The problem asks for the sum based on the specific isotopes.\n\n*   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its heavier isotope, Deuterium D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1). The isotope here is Deuterium (²H), which has a mass number of 2.\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13). The most common and only stable isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n*   **Formula of Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n\nNow, we sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements present in the formula unit:\n*   **Cumulative Mass of Lightest Element (Deuterium):** There are 4 atoms of D. So, 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Cumulative Mass of Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Al. So, 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Total Sum:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
