    "Based on the principles of electrochemistry, the correct completion of the statement is: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n*   **Thermodynamic Strength as an Oxidant:** The strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° value indicates a stronger oxidant.\n    *   In an acidic solution, the reduction of oxygen is: O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O, with a standard reduction potential (E°) of +1.23 V.\n    *   In a basic solution, the reduction of oxygen is: O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻, with a standard reduction potential (E°) of +0.40 V.\n    *   Since the reduction potential in a basic solution (+0.40 V) is significantly lower than in an acidic solution (+1.23 V), oxygen is thermodynamically a weaker oxidizing agent in basic conditions.\n\n*   **Kinetic Reaction Rate:** The kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are notoriously slow, which is a major challenge in technologies like fuel cells. This reaction involves breaking the strong double bond in the O₂ molecule and a multi-electron transfer, which inherently has a high activation energy. Both in acidic and alkaline media, the reaction is slow without a catalyst. Specifically, the kinetics of oxygen reduction in acidic solutions on electrode surfaces are known to be sluggish and require a significant overpotential to proceed at a meaningful rate.\n\nTherefore, the first blank should be \"weaker\" and the second blank should be \"slower\".\n\n<<<D>>>"
