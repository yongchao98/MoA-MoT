    "All the provided statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are accurate, with one exception. After a thorough review of the current scientific literature, the incorrect statement has been identified.\n\n**A) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting. [CORRECT]**\nSARS-CoV-2 utilizes a -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) to translate its overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b genes, producing essential polyproteins. [3, 16] This process is mediated by a highly conserved structure composed of a slippery sequence and a downstream three-stemmed RNA pseudoknot. [6, 10] Despite minor sequence differences, the pseudoknot of SARS-CoV-2 is structurally and functionally almost identical to that of SARS-CoV, leading to very similar frameshifting efficiencies. [7, 12]\n\n**B) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. [CORRECT]**\nStudies have established a linear correlation between the *in vitro* rate of ribosomal frameshifting and the conformational diversity of the stimulating pseudoknot. [4, 12] The frameshifting elements of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 populate two distinct conformations when subjected to mechanical tension, which is consistent with their measured frameshifting rates of approximately 15-30%. [4, 12, 14]\n\n**C) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. [INCORRECT]**\nThe nsp14 and nsp10 proteins do form a heterodimer where nsp10 acts as a co-factor, activating the N-terminal exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain of nsp14. [2, 3] This complex plays a crucial role in proofreading and mismatch repair by removing misincorporated nucleotides during RNA synthesis. [8, 9] However, the statement that this complex *prevents* the breakdown of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is false. The nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex is a potent nuclease that actively digests and degrades various RNA substrates, including dsRNA, in a 3' to 5' direction. [1, 6, 9] One of its proposed roles is to cleave viral dsRNA to help evade the host's innate immune response. [7, 11] Therefore, it causes the breakdown of dsRNA, rather than preventing it.\n\n**D) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. [CORRECT]**\nThe accessory protein ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 is a known inducer of apoptosis. [1, 2] Studies have demonstrated that ORF3a expression leads to the activation and cleavage of caspase-8, a hallmark of the extrinsic (death receptor) apoptotic pathway, without altering the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, which is central to the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. [5, 8, 9] This evidence strongly indicates that ORF3a initiates apoptosis primarily through the extrinsic pathway. [1, 8] This initial activation of caspase-8 can then lead to crosstalk with the intrinsic pathway via cleavage of the protein Bid. [1, 6]\n\n<<<C>>>"
