    "The scenario describes an immune response in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) initiated by an oral antigen. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the events and why somatic hypermutation is the correct process.\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery and Uptake**: The GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins are delivered orally. They travel through the GI tract, and some successfully reach the Peyer's patches in the small intestine. Peyer's patches are key immune-sensing-areas of the intestine, containing specialized M cells that sample antigens from the gut lumen and present them to underlying immune cells.\n2.  **Immune Activation in Peyer's Patches**: The presence of the fluorescent antigen in Peyer's patches indicates that an immune response has been initiated in these secondary lymphoid organs. This leads to the activation and proliferation of B cells that recognize the antigen. The proliferating cells are found in germinal centers within the Peyer's patches.\n3.  **Generation of High Variability**: The crucial finding is \"high variability\" in the *variable heavy chain gene* of these proliferating B cells. This points directly to a process that intentionally introduces mutations into this specific gene region.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n*   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a biological process that deliberately introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. It occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. The goal of SHM is to create B cells with variant receptors, some of which will have a higher affinity for the antigen. This perfectly matches the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene following antigen stimulation.\n*   **B) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune response and does not involve the genetic modification of B cell genes.\n*   **C) VDJ recombination:** This genetic recombination event creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. However, it occurs in the bone marrow in *developing* B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The process described in the scenario is happening in mature, activated B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process changes the *constant region* of the heavy chain, which alters the antibody's function (e.g., changing from IgM to IgG). It does not affect the variable region, which determines antigen specificity. Therefore, it is not responsible for the observed variability in the variable heavy chain.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in the Peyer's patches, following antigen exposure, is the definitive result of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
