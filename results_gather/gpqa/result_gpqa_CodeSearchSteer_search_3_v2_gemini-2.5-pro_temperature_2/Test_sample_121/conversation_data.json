    "The step-by-step synthesis is as follows:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid to Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) undergoes an alpha-bromination reaction (Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction) when treated with bromine (Br₂) in the presence of a catalyst (often PBr₃, which can be formed *in situ*, here promoted by pyridine and acetic anhydride). This yields alpha-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n2.  **Product 1 to Product 2:** Alpha-bromoacetic acid (Product 1) reacts with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) under acidic conditions (H₂SO₄ catalyst) in a Fischer esterification reaction. This forms ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃), which is Product 2.\n3.  **Product 2 to Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Product 2) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction, resulting in ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃), Product 3.\n4.  **Product 3 to Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (Product 3) has acidic protons on the carbon situated between the cyano and the ester groups. Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates this carbon to form a carbanion. This carbanion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane and displacing a bromide. Since excess sodium hydride is used, the carbon is deprotonated again and the resulting carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a six-membered ring. This type of reaction is a variant of the malonic ester synthesis used for ring formation. The final product, 4, is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane):**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted on a single carbon (C1) with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n*   **Symmetry:** There is a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, its substituents (-CN and -COOEt), and the C4 carbon of the ring. This plane of symmetry makes the two halves of the ring (C2-C3 and C6-C5) chemically equivalent.\n*   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):** The methylene (-CH₂-) and methyl (-CH₃) protons are chemically different from each other and from the ring protons. This will produce **2 signals**.\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** Due to the ring structure, protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent.\n    *   **C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each carbon, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships with the substituents on C1). Thus, they are chemically distinct. This pair of carbons gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5:** These positions are also equivalent to each other. Similar to C2/C6, the axial and equatorial protons on these carbons are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons on C4 (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic as they are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and produce **2 signals**.\n\nSumming up the signals:\n*   Ethyl group: 2 signals\n*   C2/C6 ring protons: 2 signals\n*   C3/C5 ring protons: 2 signals\n*   C4 ring protons: 2 signals\n\nThe total number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.\n\n<<<A>>>"
