    "To identify the correct ¹H NMR data, we must first deduce the most likely structure of the compound based on the given information.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Information\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two groups attached. It will have four protons on the aromatic ring.\n*   **8 carbon atoms:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** The other substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, or I) directly bonded to the ring. Halogens do not contain carbon atoms.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure\nBased on the analysis above, the two substituents are a halogen (-X) and a group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is the acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nThis gives us the molecular structure of a haloacetophenone. The total carbon count is 6 (benzene ring) + 2 (acetyl group) = 8 carbons, which matches the description.\n\nThere are three possible isomers: ortho, meta, and para-haloacetophenone. A para-substituted ring (1,4-disubstituted) is highly symmetrical and gives a characteristic, simple ¹H NMR pattern in the aromatic region, typically consisting of two distinct doublets, each representing two equivalent protons.\n\n### Step 3: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum\nFor a para-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone):\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** A para-substituted ring has two sets of chemically non-equivalent protons. The acetyl group is a deactivating (electron-withdrawing) group, which deshields the adjacent protons, shifting them downfield (to a higher ppm value). The halogen is also electron-withdrawing. This arrangement typically results in two signals, each integrating to 2 protons, appearing as doublets due to coupling with their neighbors. The expected region is around 7.0-8.0 ppm.\n2.  **Acetyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and are adjacent to a carbonyl group, which has no protons. Therefore, they will appear as a sharp singlet. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around 2.0-2.7 ppm.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\n*   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    This spectrum indicates the presence of an aldehyde proton (9.9 ppm) and a methylene group (3.7 ppm), which would correspond to a halo-phenylacetaldehyde. While a possible structure, the chemical shift for the methyl protons in option B is more characteristic.\n*   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    This spectrum perfectly matches the prediction for a para-haloacetophenone.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: These are the two doublets characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring with four protons.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for three protons, which is the classic signal for an acetyl methyl group (-COCH₃). The chemical shift of 2.3 ppm is within the expected range for this group. Spectral data for 4-chloroacetophenone shows a methyl singlet around 2.28-2.46 ppm and aromatic signals in the 7.0-7.9 ppm range, confirming this assignment.\n*   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    This option lacks signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) and is therefore incorrect for an aromatic compound.\n*   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    A di-substituted benzene ring should show four aromatic protons. This spectrum only shows one, so it cannot be correct.\n\nConclusion: The ¹H NMR data in option B is the only one that correctly represents a di-substituted aromatic ring with 8 total carbons, a carbonyl group, and a halogen, specifically matching the expected spectrum of a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
