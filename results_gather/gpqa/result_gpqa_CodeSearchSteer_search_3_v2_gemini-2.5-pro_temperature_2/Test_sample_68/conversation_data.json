    "To solve this problem, we must calculate the minimum distance that a detector needs to be able to resolve to observe the decay tracks of at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles. This involves several steps based on the principles of special relativity and particle physics.\n\n**1. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor describes the time dilation and length contraction effects for an object moving at relativistic speeds. It is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($mc^2$). Given the energy and mass in the same units (GeV), we can calculate it as:\n\n*   **E** = 27 GeV\n*   **m** = 3.41 GeV/$c^2$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**2. Calculate the Dilated Lifetime ($\\tau$)**\n\nDue to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the laboratory's frame of reference ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n\n*   **Proper lifetime** ($\\tau_0$) = $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   **Dilated lifetime** ($\\tau$) = $\\gamma \\times \\tau_0 = 7.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15}$ s\n\n**3. Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L)**\n\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. Since the particle is highly relativistic, its velocity is very close to the speed of light (c).\n\n*   **Speed of light (c)** $\\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   **Mean Decay Length (L)** $\\approx c \\times \\tau = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**4. Determine the Required Resolution**\n\nThe decay of individual particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. To \"observe\" a decay, the track of the particle before it decays must be longer than the spatial resolution of the detector. We need to observe at least 30% of the decays, which means that for at least 30% of the particles, their decay length must be greater than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$).\n\nThe probability that a particle travels a distance *d* or more before decaying is given by $P(d > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/L}$.\n\nWe require this probability to be at least 30% (or 0.3):\n\n$e^{-d_{res}/L} \\geq 0.3$\n\nTo find the boundary condition, we solve for $d_{res}$ where the equality holds:\n\n$-d_{res}/L = \\ln(0.3)$\n$d_{res} = -L \\times \\ln(0.3)$\n$d_{res} \\approx -(1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n$d_{res} \\approx 2.28 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis result means that to observe at least 30% of the decays, the bubble chamber's resolution must be *at most* $2.28 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. A finer resolution (a smaller value) would allow for the observation of an even greater percentage of decays.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m = 2.08 mm\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m = 2.08 nm\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m = 20.8 cm\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m = 2.08 Âµm\n\nThe calculated required resolution is on the order of micrometers ($\\mu$m). Option D is the only one in this range. The value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is less than the maximum allowable resolution of $2.28 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, making it a sufficient resolution. Indeed, bubble chambers can have resolutions of a few micrometers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
