    "The total minimum electrostatic potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere and the potential energy of interaction between the central charge and the 12 peripheral charges.\n\n1.  **Interaction Energy of Peripheral Charges (`U_peripheral`)**:\n    To achieve minimum energy, the 12 identical charges on the surface of the sphere will arrange themselves at the vertices of a regular icosahedron. The potential energy of this configuration is given by `U = E_N * (k * q^2 / R)`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant, `q` is the charge, `R` is the sphere's radius, and `E_N` is a dimensionless coefficient for N particles.\n\n    For an icosahedron (N=12), the dimensionless energy coefficient `E_12` can be calculated from its geometry. The sum of the inverse distances between all unique pairs of vertices on a unit-radius sphere gives this value. There are 66 pairs of vertices in total: 30 nearest-neighbor pairs, 30 next-nearest-neighbor pairs, and 6 antipodal pairs. The calculation based on the geometry of a regular icosahedron yields a value for this coefficient of approximately 49.164.\n\n2.  **Interaction Energy with Central Charge (`U_central`)**:\n    This is the sum of the potential energies for each of the 12 pairs formed by the central charge and one of the charges on the sphere. Since all peripheral charges are at the same distance `r` from the center, this is `U_central = 12 * (k * q_center * q_peripheral) / r`.\n\n3.  **Calculation**:\n    *   The charge `q` on each particle is `2e`, where `e = 1.602177 × 10^-19 C`. So, `q = 3.204354 × 10^-19 C`.\n    *   The distance `r` from the center P is `2 m`.\n    *   Coulomb's constant `k` is `8.98755 × 10^9 N·m²/C²`.\n\n    The potential energy of interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere is:\n    `U_central = 12 * (k * q^2) / r = 12 * (8.98755e9 * (3.204354e-19)^2) / 2 = 5.537 × 10^-27 J`.\n\n    The potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere, using the calculated coefficient `E_12 = 49.164`, is:\n    `U_peripheral = E_12 * (k * q^2) / r = 49.164 * (8.98755e9 * (3.204354e-19)^2) / 2 = 2.268 × 10^-26 J`.\n\n    The total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two values:\n    `U_total = U_central + U_peripheral = 5.537 × 10^-27 J + 2.268 × 10^-26 J`\n    `U_total = 0.5537 × 10^-26 J + 2.268 × 10^-26 J = 2.8217 × 10^-26 J`.\n\n    Rounding to three decimals, the minimum energy is `2.822 × 10^-26 J`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
