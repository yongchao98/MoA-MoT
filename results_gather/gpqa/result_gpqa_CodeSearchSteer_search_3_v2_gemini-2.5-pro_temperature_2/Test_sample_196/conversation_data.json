    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of Compound X from Spectral Data**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    *   The broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a distinctive feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ indicate C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the 7.2 ppm signal is next to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (2.9 to 0.9 ppm):**\n        *   The signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) describe a *sec*-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A terminal methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** The methylene group (-CH₂) coupled to the terminal methyl group and the benzylic CH.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** The methine group (-CH-) directly attached to the aromatic ring (benzylic position) and coupled to the adjacent methyl and methylene groups.\n    *   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Based on the integrated analysis of the IR and NMR data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction essentially removes all oxygen atoms from the carboxyl group and replaces them with hydrogen atoms.\n\n**3. Determination of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Final Structure:** The *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring remain unchanged. Therefore, the resulting molecule is a benzene ring substituted with a *sec*-butyl group and a methyl group at positions 1 and 4, respectively.\n*   **Name of Product:** The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**4. Final Answer Selection**\n\nComparing the deduced product with the given choices:\n*   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **Correct.**\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl group.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, not the product.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n\n<<<A>>>"
