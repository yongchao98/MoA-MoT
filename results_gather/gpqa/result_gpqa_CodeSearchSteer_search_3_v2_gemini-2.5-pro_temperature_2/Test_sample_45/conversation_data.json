    "When racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with a Grubbs catalyst, it undergoes a self-metathesis reaction. The reactant is a 1:1 mixture of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. The reaction involves the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds, which, in this case, leads to the formation of ethene and a dimerized product, 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the starting materials and the nature of the newly formed double bond must be considered to determine the total number of possible products (excluding ethene).\n\nThe self-metathesis reaction can occur in three different ways based on the chirality of the reacting molecules:\n1.  **(R)-isomer + (R)-isomer:** This reaction produces (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. The new double bond can have either an (E)- or (Z)-configuration, resulting in two diastereomeric products: (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene and (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n2.  **(S)-isomer + (S)-isomer:** This reaction produces (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. Similar to the R+R reaction, this results in two diastereomers: (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene and (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. The (E)-(3S,6S) isomer is the enantiomer of the (E)-(3R,6R) isomer, and the (Z)-(3S,6S) isomer is the enantiomer of the (Z)-(3R,6R) isomer. Together, these two reactions produce a total of four stereoisomers.\n3.  **(R)-isomer + (S)-isomer (cross-metathesis):** This reaction yields (3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. This particular combination results in meso compounds because the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Like the other reactions, this can form both (E) and (Z) isomers of the product. This gives two more distinct products: (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso) and (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso).\n\nIn total, combining all possible reactions, we have four chiral products (two pairs of enantiomers) and two achiral meso compounds. This gives a total of six possible stereoisomeric products.\n\nThe six products are:\n*   (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n*   (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n*   (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n*   (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n*   (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n*   (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n\n<<<D>>>"
