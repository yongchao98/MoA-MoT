    "The detailed analysis of the products from each reaction and their subsequent chromatographic behavior confirms the answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is a chiral ketone. It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at the C3 position to an alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material already possesses a stereocenter at C5 (with S configuration) which is unaffected by the reaction, the products will be a pair of diastereomers: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral molecule. It is reduced by an excess of Sodium Borohydride (NaBHâ‚„), which will reduce both ketone groups to alcohol groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and the meso compound (2R, 4S). The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers, while the meso-pentane-2,4-diol is their diastereomer.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe combined product mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation):**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity but cannot differentiate between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and will be separated from them. This gives **one peak** for the meso compound.\n*   The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 ethers) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally very different and will be separated from each other.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of separable components: 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (meso compound from Reaction II) + 1 (enantiomeric pair from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nA chiral stationary phase can separate enantiomers in addition to separating diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol, being a distinct diastereomer from the other compounds, will elute as a **single peak**.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of all stereoisomers present in the mixture: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from the enantiomeric pair in Reaction II) + 1 (from the meso compound in Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\nIn conclusion, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
