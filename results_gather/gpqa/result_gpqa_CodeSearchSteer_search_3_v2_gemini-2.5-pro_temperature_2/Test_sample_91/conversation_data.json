    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.\n\n### 1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass\n\nFirst, we identify the chemical formula for the molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`:\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 2(CH₃) + 1(C) + 1(CH) + 1(CH₂) + 1(CH) + 1(CH₃) + 1(CH₂) + 1(CH) + 1(C) + 2(CH₃) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 2(3) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2(3) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n\nThe molar mass is calculated as:\nMolar Mass = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n### 2. Tally the Chemical Bonds\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** For a non-cyclic molecule, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds (single and multiple) is one less than the number of carbon atoms. With 12 carbon atoms, there are 11 total C-C links. Since 2 are double bonds, the remaining are single bonds.\n    Number of C-C bonds = (Total C atoms - 1) - (Number of C=C bonds) = (12 - 1) - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is calculated using the following formula, which is an application of Hess's Law.\nΔH_f = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of elements) - (Sum of bond energies of the compound)\n\n**a) Calculate the sum of enthalpies of atomization for the elements:**\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements in their standard state into individual gaseous atoms.\n*   For 12 moles of Carbon: 12 × ΔH_at(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   For 22 moles of Hydrogen (from 11 moles of H₂): 11 × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total atomization energy** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**b) Calculate the total bond energy of the compound:**\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms form one mole of the compound.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total bond energy** = 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = **11200 kJ**\n\n**c) Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol:**\n*   ΔH_f = (Total atomization energy) - (Total bond energy)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ - 11200 kJ = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### 4. Convert to kJ/g\n\nThe options include answers in kJ/g, so we convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass.\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (ΔH_f (kJ/mol)) / (Molar Mass (g/mol))\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nComparing this result to the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
