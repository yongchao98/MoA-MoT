    "Based on the series of reactions, the identities of the compounds can be deduced as follows:\n\n*   **A = S₈ (Sulfur):** This is a solid element.\n*   **B = Cl₂ (Chlorine):** This is a gas.\n*   **C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride):** This is a cherry-red liquid product. The reaction `S₈ + 8Cl₂ → 8SCl₂` matches the color description, although the \"8 equivalents\" clue in the prompt might be simplified, as the standard reaction is `S₈ + 4Cl₂ → 4S₂Cl₂` which can be further chlorinated to SCl₂.\n*   **D = CO (Carbon monoxide):** This is a gas.\n*   **H = COCl₂ (Phosgene):** Formed in a 1:1 ratio from gas D (CO) and gas B (Cl₂), phosgene is a known industrial solvent.\n*   **Reaction of C with water:** The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (C) is a disproportionation reaction. `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This reforms solid sulfur (A).\n    *   It produces hydrochloric acid (F), which is a strong acid.\n    *   It produces sulfur dioxide, which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid, H₂SO₃ (G), a weak acid.\n*   **E = COCl₂ (Phosgene):** The reaction of sulfur dichloride (C) with carbon monoxide (D) produces phosgene (E). Phosgene is an extremely hazardous substance. It is possible for product E and solvent H to be the same compound.\n*   **Molecular Symmetry of E:** The molecule E is phosgene (COCl₂). Its structure is trigonal planar around the central carbon atom. It possesses a C₂ axis along the C=O bond and two perpendicular mirror planes. A molecule with these symmetry elements belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product E (phosgene) is C2v.\n\n<<<A>>>"
