    "To determine the angle between the two photons, we must apply the laws of conservation of energy and momentum to the electron-positron annihilation.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nFirst, we calculate the total energy of the system before the collision. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):**\n    *   Energy of the electron: `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²`\n    *   Energy of the positron: `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 * m_e * c²` (A positron has the same rest mass as an electron).\n    *   Total initial energy: `E_initial = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²`\n\nThe initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons after annihilation.\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):**\n    *   The problem states that the two photons have the same energy, which we can call `E_ph`.\n    *   Total final energy: `E_final = E_ph + E_ph = 2 * E_ph`\n\nBy the law of conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`:\n`6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_ph`\n`E_ph = 3 * m_e * c²`\n\nEach photon has an energy of `3 * m_e * c²`.\n\n### 2. Conservation of Momentum\n\nNext, we apply the conservation of momentum. The initial momentum of the system is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by `p = sqrt(γ² - 1) * mc`.\n\n*   **Initial Momentum (p_initial):**\n    *   The electron moves from left to right (positive direction) with `γ_e = 4`.\n        `p_electron = sqrt(4² - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(15) * m_e * c`\n    *   The positron moves from right to left (negative direction) with `γ_p = 2`.\n        `p_positron = -sqrt(2² - 1) * m_e * c = -sqrt(3) * m_e * c`\n    *   Total initial momentum (along the horizontal axis):\n        `p_initial = p_electron + p_positron = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c`\n\nThe total momentum must be conserved after the annihilation. The photons are emitted at angles to the horizontal axis. Since one moves to the upper-right and the other to the lower-right, and they have the same energy, their angles with the horizontal axis must be equal and opposite (`θ` and `-θ`) for the vertical components of their momenta to cancel out, conserving the initial zero vertical momentum.\n\n*   **Final Momentum (p_final):**\n    *   The momentum of a photon is `p_ph = E_ph / c`.\n        `p_ph = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c`\n    *   The horizontal component of the momentum for each photon is `p_ph * cos(θ)`.\n    *   Total final momentum (along the horizontal axis):\n        `p_final = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ)`\n        `p_final = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)`\n\nBy the law of conservation of momentum, `p_initial = p_final`:\n`(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Angle\n\nWe can now solve for `cos(θ)`:\n`cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\nUsing the approximate values `sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873` and `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732`:\n`cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n\nNow, we find the angle `θ`:\n`θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is `θ + θ = 2θ`.\n\n`Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°`\n\nThis value is very close to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
