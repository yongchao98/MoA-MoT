    "The search results confirm my calculation methodology. Several sources describe the process for reacting acids and bases. Specifically, one result confirms that when mixing a weak acid and a strong base, if the strong base is in excess, the pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base. Other examples show similar calculations where excess strong base or acid dictates the final pH. For instance, several sources show a calculation resulting in an [OH-] concentration of 0.04167 M, which yields a pOH of 1.38 and a pH of 12.62. This matches my calculated result precisely.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of the acidic and basic species:**\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid) = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid) = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 (strong base) = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions per molecule, moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n2.  **Neutralize the strong acid and strong base:**\n    The strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)2) will react first.\n    *   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   Initial moles H+ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H+ will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining after neutralization = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n3.  **Neutralize the weak acid with the remaining strong base:**\n    The excess OH- will then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of available OH- = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH3COOH will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n4.  **Calculate the final concentration and pH:**\n    The final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH- in a total volume of 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL or 1.2 L. The pH of the solution is determined by this excess strong base.\n    *   Final [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n    *   Calculate pOH: pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.\n    *   Calculate pH: pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
