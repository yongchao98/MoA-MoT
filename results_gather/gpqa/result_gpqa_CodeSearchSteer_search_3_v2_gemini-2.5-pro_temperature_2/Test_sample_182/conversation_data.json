    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to identify the starting material and the final product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Structure of the Reactant\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to determine its structure:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: This is the principal functional group, so the carbon it's attached to is C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl group (-CHO) is located on C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is on C5.\n\nBased on this, the molecular formula of the reactant is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nWe can calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant to confirm the structure. The formula for IHD is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n*   IHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 ring (cyclohexene)\n*   1 C=C bond in the ring\n*   1 C=C bond in the vinyl group\n*   1 C=O bond in the formyl group\n*   1 C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. This confirms the structural features.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is capable of reducing several functional groups to their corresponding alkanes:\n*   **Carboxylic acids (-COOH)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehydes (-CHO)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\n### 3. Structure of the Product\nApplying these transformations to our reactant:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring (the double bond is reduced).\n*   The carboxylic acid group at C1 becomes a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group at C2 becomes a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The vinyl group at C5 becomes an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃) as its double bond is reduced.\n\nThe resulting product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nNow we determine the molecular formula of the product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane.\n*   Cyclohexane ring: C₆\n*   Two methyl groups: 2 × CH₃ = C₂H₆\n*   One ethyl group: C₂H₅\n*   Total Carbons = 6 + 2 + 2 = 10.\n*   A saturated C₁₀ alkane would be C₁₀H₂₂. Our product has one ring.\n*   The formula for a monocyclic alkane is CₙH₂ₙ. For C₁₀, this would be C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe molecular formula of 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the product is calculated as follows:\n*   IHD = C - H/2 + 1\n*   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be determined by counting the rings and π-bonds in the final structure. The product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, contains **one ring** and **zero π-bonds**.\n*   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds)\n*   IHD = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
