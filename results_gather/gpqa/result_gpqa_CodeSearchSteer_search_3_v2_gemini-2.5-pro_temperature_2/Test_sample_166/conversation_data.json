    "Here is the step-by-step calculation of the non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\n*   **State (rho):** The Schrödinger cat state is defined as `|ψ> = (cos(phi)|α> + sin(phi)|-α>) / N`. For `phi = -π/4` and a real `α`, this simplifies to the \"odd cat state\": `|ψ> = (|α> - |-α>) / Nc`, where `Nc` is the appropriate normalization constant.\n*   **Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure:** The measure is the relative entropy `del_b = S(τ) - S(ρ)`, where `S(ρ) = -trace(ρ*ln(ρ))` is the von Neumann entropy.\n*   **Reference State (tau):** `τ` is the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments (mean and covariance matrix) as the state `ρ`.\n*   **Simplification:** Since `ρ` represents a pure state `(|ψ><ψ|)`, its entropy `S(ρ)` is zero. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity simplifies to `del_b = S(τ)`, the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.\n\n### 2. Determine the Moments of the Schrödinger Cat State (ρ)\n\nFirst, we need to find the first and second moments of our specific Schrödinger cat state, where `α = 0.5`.\n\n*   **First Moment (Mean amplitude):** `<a>`\n    For an odd cat state, the average amplitude is zero.\n    `<a> = 0`\n\n*   **Second Moments:** `<n> = <a†a>` and `<a²>`\n    For an odd cat state, the expectation value of the square of the annihilation operator `a` is an eigenstate equation: `a²|ψ> = α²|ψ>`. This leads to:\n    `<a²> = α² = (0.5)² = 0.25`\n\n    The mean photon number `<n>` for an odd cat state is given by the formula:\n    `<n> = α² * coth(α²)`.\n    With `α² = 0.25`, we have:\n    `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n\n    Using a calculator, `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.083`.\n    Therefore, `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 ≈ 1.02075`.\n\n### 3. Determine the Parameters of the Reference Gaussian State (τ)\n\nThe reference state `τ` is a Gaussian state with the same moments. Since `<a> = 0`, `τ` is a centered (zero-displacement) Gaussian state, which is a squeezed thermal state. Its moments are defined by its mean thermal photon number (`n_th`) and a real squeezing parameter (`r`).\n\nThe moments for a squeezed thermal state are:\n1.  `<n>_τ = n_th * cosh(2r) + sinh²(r)`\n2.  `<a²>_τ = (n_th + 0.5) * sinh(2r)`\n\nWe set these equal to the moments of our cat state:\n1.  `n_th * cosh(2r) + sinh²(r) = 1.02075`\n2.  `(n_th + 0.5) * sinh(2r) = 0.25`\n\nSolving this system of equations for `n_th` yields:\n`n_th = 1`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State (τ)\n\nThe final step is to calculate the non-Gaussianity, which is the entropy `S(τ)`. The entropy of a squeezed thermal state is identical to the entropy of a regular thermal state with the same mean thermal photon number `n_th`.\n\nThe formula for the von Neumann entropy of a thermal state is:\n`S(τ) = (n_th + 1) * ln(n_th + 1) - n_th * ln(n_th)`\n\nSubstituting `n_th = 1`:\n`S(τ) = (1 + 1) * ln(1 + 1) - 1 * ln(1)`\n`S(τ) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * 0`\n`S(τ) = 2 * ln(2)`\n\nSince `ln(2) ≈ 0.693`, the non-Gaussianity is:\n`del_b = 2 * 0.693 = 1.386`\n\nThis value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
