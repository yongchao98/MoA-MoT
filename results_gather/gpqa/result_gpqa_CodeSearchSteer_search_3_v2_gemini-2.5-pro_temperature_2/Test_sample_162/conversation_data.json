    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the chemical reaction**\nTo dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, it must be reacted with an acid (H⁺). The neutralization reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFor the Fe(OH)₃ to be completely dissolved, the concentrations of its ions in the solution must satisfy the solubility product constant (Ksp) expression:\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\nThe minimum amount of acid required is the amount that will cause the ion product to be equal to Ksp when all 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ has been converted to Fe³⁺.\n\n**2. Find necessary physical constants**\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** Based on atomic masses, the molar mass is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n*   **Solubility Product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃ at 25 °C:** Values in the literature can vary. A commonly cited value is Ksp = 1.1 × 10⁻³⁶. We will use this value for the calculation.\n\n**3. Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ and the final concentration of Fe³⁺**\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass\n    Moles = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol\n*   This amount is dissolved in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n*   Final concentration of Fe³⁺ = Moles / Volume\n    [Fe³⁺] = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M\n\n**4. Determine the pH of the resulting solution**\nTo find the pH, we first need to calculate the maximum hydroxide concentration ([OH⁻]) allowed in the solution before Fe(OH)₃ precipitates.\n\n*   Rearrange the Ksp expression to solve for [OH⁻]:\n    [OH⁻]³ = Ksp / [Fe³⁺]\n    [OH⁻]³ = (1.1 × 10⁻³⁶) / 0.009357 ≈ 1.176 × 10⁻³⁴ M³\n*   Take the cube root to find [OH⁻]:\n    [OH⁻] = (1.176 × 10⁻³⁴)¹ᐟ³ ≈ 4.90 × 10⁻¹² M\n*   Calculate the pOH of the solution:\n    pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(4.90 × 10⁻¹²) ≈ 11.31\n*   Calculate the pH at 25°C:\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 11.31 = **2.69**\n\n**5. Calculate the minimum volume of strong acid needed**\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid is used for two purposes:\n    a) Neutralizing the Fe(OH)₃.\n    b) Establishing the final acidic pH of the solution.\n\n*   **a) Moles of H⁺ for neutralization:**\n    From the stoichiometry (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺), 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles H⁺ (react) = 3 × 0.0009357 mol = 0.002807 mol\n*   **b) Moles of H⁺ remaining for final pH:**\n    [H⁺] at final pH = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.00204 M\n    Moles H⁺ (remain) = [H⁺] × Total Volume = 0.00204 M × 0.1 L = 0.000204 mol\n*   **Total moles of H⁺ needed:**\n    Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (react) + Moles H⁺ (remain)\n    Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = 0.003011 mol\n*   **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid:**\n    Volume = Total Moles / Concentration\n    Volume = 0.003011 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03011 L\n*   Convert the volume to cm³:\n    Volume = 0.03011 L × 1000 cm³/L = **30.11 cm³**\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 2.69 and Volume ≈ 30.11 cm³. These values closely match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
