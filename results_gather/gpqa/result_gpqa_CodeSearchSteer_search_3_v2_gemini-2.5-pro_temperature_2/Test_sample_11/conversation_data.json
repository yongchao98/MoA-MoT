    "### Kinetic Energies of Product Particles in Pion Decay Calculated\n\nIn the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (νμ), the kinetic energies of the resulting particles have been determined to be approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This distribution of energy is dictated by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**Analysis of the Decay:**\n\nThe decay process is represented as:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + νμ\n\nGiven the rest masses are:\n*   Rest Mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest Mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The muon neutrino (νμ) is treated as massless (m_ν ≈ 0) for this calculation.\n\n**Conservation Laws:**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** Since the pion is at rest, its total initial energy is its rest mass energy, 139.6 MeV. This energy must be conserved and is converted into the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest mass between the pion and the muon, which is 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. This total kinetic energy is shared between the two product particles.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial momentum is zero as the pion is stationary. To conserve momentum, the muon and neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nUsing the relativistic energy-momentum relation (E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²), and applying the conservation laws, we can derive the energies of the final particles.\n\nThe total energy of the muon (Eμ) can be calculated with the formula:\nEμ = [(m_π² * c⁴) + (m_μ² * c⁴)] / [2 * m_π * c²]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\nEμ = [(139.6)² + (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\nEμ ≈ [19488.16 + 11172.49] / 279.2\nEμ ≈ 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) is its total energy minus its rest mass energy:\nKE_μ = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.1 MeV. More precise calculations yield a value closer to 4.12 MeV.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν) is the remaining portion of the released energy:\nKE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 4.12 MeV ≈ 29.78 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV.\n\nThese calculated values for the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino match one of the provided options. A similar calculation from another source confirms the muon's kinetic energy is approximately 4.08 MeV to 4.13 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
