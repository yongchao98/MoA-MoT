    "### Executive Summary of Chemical Reactions and Analysis\n\n**Reaction 1:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans* alkene) is treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. This sequence of reactions results in an *anti*-dihydroxylation. The anti-addition to a trans-alkene yields a single *meso* compound, specifically *meso*-octane-4,5-diol ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol).\n\n**Reaction 2:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis* alkene) undergoes the same reaction sequence. The *anti*-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers. In this case, the products are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Product Mixture:** The combined products from both reactions contain three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  *meso*-octane-4,5-diol (a diastereomer of the other two).\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer).\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer).\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\nAn achiral HPLC column can separate compounds with different physical properties, such as diastereomers. However, it cannot distinguish between enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in a non-chiral environment.\n*   The *meso*-diol and the enantiomeric pair are diastereomers and will separate into two distinct peaks.\n*   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will not be resolved and will elute together as a single peak.\nTherefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. It also separates diastereomers, often more readily.\n*   The chiral column will resolve all three stereoisomers because they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   The *meso*-compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will have a unique retention time.\n*   The two enantiomers will also be separated from each other, each giving a distinct peak.\nThus, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
