    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct transition route and its probability:\n\n1.  **Understand the Transition and States**: The problem asks for the decay path of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ (a 3s orbital) to the final state |1,0,0⟩ (the 1s ground state) through a sequence of two electric dipole transitions. The notation |n,l,m⟩ represents the principal, angular momentum, and magnetic quantum numbers, respectively. The problem specifies that this occurs within the non-relativistic theory, which means we should not consider fine structure effects like spin-orbit coupling.\n\n2.  **Electric Dipole Selection Rules**: For an electric dipole transition to occur between an initial state |n,l,m⟩ and a final state |n',l',m'⟩, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   The change in the angular momentum quantum number, Δl, must be ±1.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm, must be 0 or ±1.\n    *   There is no selection rule for the principal quantum number, n.\n\n3.  **First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State**:\n    *   The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, so l=0.\n    *   According to the Δl = ±1 rule, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n    *   The problem implies a cascade through the n=2 shell, so the intermediate state will be of the form |2,1,m'⟩.\n    *   For the initial state, m=0. According to the Δm = 0, ±1 rule, the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state, m', can be 0, 1, or -1.\n    *   Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. All three potential pathways listed in the options are allowed by these selection rules.\n\n4.  **Second Transition: Intermediate State → |1,0,0⟩**:\n    *   The intermediate states are |2,1,m'⟩, with l'=1.\n    *   The final state is |1,0,0⟩, with l=0. The change Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 satisfies the selection rule.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = 0 - m', must be 0, ±1. This condition is met for all possible m' values (-1, 0, 1).\n    *   So, all three pathways are valid cascade routes for the decay.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**: We need to find the probability of the atom taking one specific route out of the three possibilities. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition (|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩).\n    *   The initial state, |3,0,0⟩ (3s), is spherically symmetric.\n    *   In spontaneous emission without any external polarizing fields, there is no preferred direction of decay.\n    *   Consequently, the transition populates each of the possible final magnetic sublevels (m' = -1, 0, 1) of the |2,1,m'⟩ state with equal probability.\n    *   Since there are three equally probable final m' states, the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is 1/3.\n    *   Once the atom is in a specific intermediate state (e.g., |2,1,0⟩), it will decay to the |1,0,0⟩ ground state with a probability of 1, as this is the only available lower-energy state allowed by selection rules.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of each of the three complete decay routes is 1/3.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options**:\n    *   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4: The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3: The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3: Both the transition route and the calculated probability are correct.\n    *   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4: The probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only option that presents a valid decay route with the correct corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
