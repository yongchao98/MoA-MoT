    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift for detecting Lyman-alpha absorption from deep space using ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength at which Earth's atmosphere becomes transparent to light.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Å (or 121.6 nm). This wavelength falls in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Earth's atmosphere is largely opaque to UV radiation, primarily due to absorption by ozone. Ground-based optical telescopes are therefore effective only for wavelengths that can penetrate the atmosphere. This atmospheric cutoff occurs at the blue end of the visible spectrum.\n\nThe atmospheric transmission drops significantly below wavelengths of about 3800-4000 Å. For practical purposes in ground-based astronomy, the usable optical window begins around 3200-3400 Å, though transparency is already decreasing at these wavelengths. For a Lyman-alpha absorption feature to be detectable, it must be redshifted from its original 1216 Å to a wavelength that falls within this observable window.\n\nThe relationship between redshift (z), the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted), and the observed wavelength (λ_observed) is given by the formula:\n\nλ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z)\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we can set λ_emitted to 1216 Å and use a conservative estimate for the atmospheric cutoff, λ_observed, of approximately 3800 Å.\n\nCalculating the redshift:\n\nz = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1\nz = (3800 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 3.125 - 1\nz ≈ 2.125\n\nUsing a slightly more optimistic cutoff of 3650 Å:\n\nz = (3650 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 3.0 - 1\nz ≈ 2.0\n\nSome sources explicitly state that Lyman-alpha absorption becomes accessible to ground-based telescopes at a redshift greater than 2. If we use an even stricter atmospheric cutoff of around 4000 Å for better transparency, the required redshift would be:\n\nz = (4000 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 3.29 - 1\nz ≈ 2.29\n\nBased on these calculations, a redshift of around 2 is required to shift the 1216 Å line into the very edge of the observable optical window, while a redshift of 2.3-2.4 would bring it into a more clearly observable range for most ground-based instruments. Therefore, the most reasonable lower limit from the given options is 2.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
