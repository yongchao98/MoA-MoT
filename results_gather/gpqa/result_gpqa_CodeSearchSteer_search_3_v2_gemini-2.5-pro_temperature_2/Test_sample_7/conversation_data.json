  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Single-Mutant Results\n\n*   **Wild-Type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is the baseline for a fully functional pathway.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 leads to a partial loss of resistance (25% reduction). This indicates G1 has a positive, but non-essential, role in resistance.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 causes a more significant drop in resistance (50% reduction), suggesting it plays a more substantial role than G1.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 completely eliminates resistance. This implies that G2 is an essential gene for the anthracnose resistance pathway.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Double-Mutant Results (Epistasis Analysis)\n\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another. In a double mutant, if the phenotype is identical to one of the single mutants, the gene corresponding to that single mutant is considered \"epistatic\" to the other.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant phenotype. Therefore, the effect of the `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g1` mutation. This means **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance. Similarly, this phenotype matches the `g2` single mutant. The effect of the `g2` mutation also masks the effect of the `g3` mutation. This means **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\nWhen one gene is epistatic to others, it often acts downstream in a linear pathway or is a central, essential component of the overall process. Since the prompt mentions that at least one gene is a transcription factor, the gene with the most severe phenotype that is epistatic to others is the strongest candidate for a master transcription factor controlling the pathway. Therefore, **G2 is very likely the transcription factor**.\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance. This phenotype is different and more severe than either of the single mutants (`g1` at 75% and `g3` at 50%).\n    *   Because the phenotype is not the same as either single mutant, neither G1 nor G3 is classically epistatic to the other.\n    *   The combined loss of G1 and G3 function results in a much greater loss of resistance (a 90% reduction) than would be expected from simply adding the individual losses (25% + 50% = 75% reduction). This strong synergistic effect suggests that G1 and G3 may have similar, overlapping functions, a concept known as **gene redundancy**. They likely act in parallel to contribute to resistance.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on our conclusions:\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   *G1 is a transcription factor:* Unlikely. G2 is the best candidate due to its essential role.\n    *   *G2 and G3 show pleiotropy:* We cannot determine this. The experiment only tests for one phenotype (disease resistance).\n    *   *G2 is epistatic towards G1:* Correct. However, with two incorrect statements, this option is weak.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:* Correct. Their synergistic interaction points to this.\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* Incorrect. The phenotype of the g1g3 double mutant (10%) is not the same as the g1 single mutant (75%). Despite this final incorrect statement, the first two major conclusions are correct.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show pleiotropy:* Cannot be determined.\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct.\n    *   *G1 and G3 has the same promoter:* Cannot be determined from these genetic interaction data.\n    *   *G3 is epistatic towards G1:* Incorrect. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g3 phenotype (50%).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B correctly identifies the most important findings from the experiment: G2 is the key regulatory gene (the likely transcription factor), and G1 and G3 have redundant or synergistic functions. Although its final clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect based on a strict definition of epistasis, it is the best-fitting choice among the given options as it captures the two main aspects of the gene network correctly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
