    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the fundamental principles of black-body radiation. The information regarding the mass and radial velocities of the stars is not necessary for this calculation.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: This law states that the luminosity (L), or total power radiated by a star, is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    *   L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates a star's temperature to the wavelength (λ_max) at which it emits the most light. The law shows that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature (λ_max ∝ 1/T). Therefore, if two stars have the same peak emission wavelength, they must have the same surface temperature.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Analyze Temperature**: The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. According to Wien's Displacement Law, this means their surface temperatures are equal.\n    *   λ_max,1 = λ_max,2\n    *   Therefore, T_1 = T_2\n\n2.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio**: We want to find the ratio of Star_1's luminosity (L₁) to Star_2's luminosity (L₂). Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\n3.  **Simplify the Ratio**: The constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, leaving:\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = (R₁²/R₂²) * (T₁⁴/T₂⁴)\n    *   This can be rewritten as: L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Substitute Known Values**:\n    *   We are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    *   From our analysis using Wien's law, the temperatures are equal, so T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Factor**:\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
