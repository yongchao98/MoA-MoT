    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. A spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along its symmetry axis (the z-axis) can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, which is the simplest form of an oscillating charge system.\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (sin²θ) / λ⁴`\n\nWhere:\n*   `θ` is the angle between the direction of observation and the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the radiation.\n\nFrom this relationship, we can determine both the angular dependence and the wavelength dependence of the radiated power.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe radiated power is proportional to `sin²θ`. The maximum power, `A`, is radiated at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis), because `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`, we calculate `sin²(30°)`:\n`sin(30°) = 1/2`\n`sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `A/4`.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe radiated power per unit solid angle is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength (`λ⁻⁴`). This means that shorter wavelengths are radiated much more strongly than longer wavelengths. This λ⁻⁴ dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is famously responsible for phenomena like Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining these two results, the fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is 1/4, and the functional form of the power dependence on wavelength is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
