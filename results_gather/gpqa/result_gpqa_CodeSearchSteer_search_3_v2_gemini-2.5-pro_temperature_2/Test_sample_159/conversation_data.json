    "An N-sided polygon where N approaches infinity becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' of this polygon becomes the radius of the resulting circle. The problem, therefore, is to find the angular distance between the first two minima of the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThis diffraction pattern is known as the Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central region called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J1(x).\n\nThe condition for the minima is given by the formula:\n\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum in radians.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   d is the diameter of the aperture (d = 2a).\n*   m is a coefficient derived from the zeros of the Bessel function.\n\n**For the first minimum:**\nThe first zero of the Bessel function J1(x) occurs at approximately x = 3.8317. The corresponding coefficient 'm' in the simplified formula is 1.22.\nSo, the angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is:\nθ₁ = 1.22 * λ / d = 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a\n\n**For the second minimum:**\nThe second zero of the Bessel function J1(x) occurs at approximately x = 7.0156. The coefficient 'm' for the second minimum is approximately 2.23.\nSo, the angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is:\nθ₂ = 2.23 * λ / d = 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a\n\n**Angular distance between the first two minima:**\nThe angular distance (Δθ) is the difference between the positions of the second and first minima:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.115 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.505 * λ / a\n\nThis value is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ /a\n\nThe calculated angular distance matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
