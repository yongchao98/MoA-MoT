    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the percentage of dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution.\n\n1.  **Understand the System**: We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ions. Several complexation reactions occur, forming different cobalt-thiocyanate species: [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. We are given the overall stability constants (β) for these reactions.\n\n2.  **Define the Goal**: The objective is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n3.  **Use the Alpha Fraction Formula**: The fraction (α) of a specific metal-ligand complex, [MLₙ], out of the total metal concentration can be calculated using the stability constants and the free ligand concentration. The formula for the fraction of the species [Co(SCN)₂], denoted as α₂, is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Identify Given Values**:\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M\n    *   Thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M (Since the thiocyanate concentration is significantly higher than the cobalt concentration, we can approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to the total ligand concentration.)\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n5.  **Calculate the Terms for the Formula**:\n    *   The numerator is: β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   The terms in the denominator (the sum of which is called the side-reaction coefficient, Φ) are:\n        *   1\n        *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n        *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n6.  **Calculate the Sum of the Denominator (Φ)**:\n    *   Φ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n7.  **Calculate the Fraction (α₂)**:\n    *   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n8.  **Convert to Percentage**:\n    *   Percentage = α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
