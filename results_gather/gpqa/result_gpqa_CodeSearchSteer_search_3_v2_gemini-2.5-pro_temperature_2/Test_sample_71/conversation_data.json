    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations to determine the structure of the final product **4** and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants**: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide.\n*   **Reaction**: The combination of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide is a method for the *in situ* generation of *o*-xylylene (also known as *o*-quinodimethane), a reactive diene.\n*   The 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene molecule has two carbon-carbon double bonds, which act as dienophiles in a Diels-Alder reaction. Since two equivalents of the *o*-xylylene precursor are used, two successive Diels-Alder reactions occur, one at each double bond of the norbornadiene derivative.\n*   The addition is expected to occur from the *exo* face of the norbornadiene system due to steric hindrance.\n*   **Product 1** is the resulting *exo,exo*-diadduct, a complex pentacyclic molecule with a tert-butoxy group at the bridge position.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction**: Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid.\n*   **Transformation**: This is a standard acidic deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group is converted to a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Product 2** is the same pentacyclic structure as **1**, but with a hydroxyl group in place of the tert-butoxy group.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction**: Product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Transformation**: These are the conditions for a Parikh-Doering oxidation, which oxidizes a secondary alcohol to a ketone. Product **2** has a secondary alcohol at the C7 (bridge) position of the original norbornane skeleton.\n*   **Product 3** is the corresponding ketone, `exo,exo-dibenzo[b,g]bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-7-one`.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4 and Analysis**\n*   **Reaction**: Product 3 is heated at 150°C.\n*   **Transformation Analysis**: This step involves considering the thermal stability of Product 3. While heating can often induce retro-Diels-Alder reactions, these typically require higher temperatures for such a stable, polycyclic ketone. The reaction conditions of 150°C are considered moderate and may not be sufficient to overcome the activation energy for the fragmentation of Product 3. Therefore, it is most likely that no reaction occurs.\n*   **Product 4**: Assuming no reaction takes place upon heating, Product 4 is identical to Product 3.\n\n**Determination of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (same as Product 3)**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we analyze the symmetry of the molecule `exo,exo-dibenzo[b,g]bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-7-one`.\n\n*   **Symmetry**: The molecule possesses a C2 axis of symmetry. This axis passes through the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the C1-C4 bond of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core. This symmetry element makes pairs of atoms equivalent.\n*   **Aliphatic Hydrogens**:\n    1.  The two bridgehead protons (at C1 and C4) are equivalent. This is one set of hydrogens.\n    2.  The protons on the carbons where the fusion occurred (C2, C3, C5, C6). The C2 axis interchanges the environment of H2 with H5, and H3 with H6. The protons at C2/H5 and C3/H6 are not equivalent to each other due to their different proximity to the bridgehead carbons. This gives two more sets of hydrogens.\n    In total, there are **3** sets of chemically distinct aliphatic hydrogens.\n*   **Aromatic Hydrogens**:\n    1.  The C2 axis makes the two benzene rings equivalent.\n    2.  We only need to consider the protons on one benzene ring. The fusion of the benzene ring to the chiral bicyclic scaffold means there is no plane of symmetry bisecting the benzene ring.\n    3.  Therefore, the four protons on a single benzene ring are all chemically distinct from one another.\n    This gives **4** sets of chemically distinct aromatic hydrogens.\n\nCombining both aliphatic and aromatic protons, the total number of chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms in product **4** is 3 + 4 = **7**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
