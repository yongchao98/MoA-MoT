    "The correct identification of Compound X relies on a two-step process: first, determining the structure of the reaction product from the provided NMR data, and second, deducing the starting material that would yield this product under the given reaction conditions.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Reaction Product\n\nThe provided spectral data corresponds to the product of the reaction.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:** The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in a ketone. The signals in the range of δ 126.9-144.1 ppm are typical for aromatic and vinylic (C=C) carbons. The two signals at δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm correspond to aliphatic carbon atoms, likely methyl groups.\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and 2.31 (3H) indicate the presence of two distinct methyl (CH₃) groups that are not coupled to any other protons.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic/vinylic region (δ 6.75-7.71) reveal two separate spin systems. The pair of doublets at δ 7.08 (2H) and δ 7.71 (2H) strongly suggests a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The other pair of doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and δ 7.68 (1H) indicates two coupled protons on a double bond (-CH=CH-).\n*   **Structure Assembly:** Combining these fragments leads to the structure of (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This structure possesses a *para*-tolyl group (a methyl group on a benzene ring), which accounts for one methyl singlet and the pair of 2H doublets. It also contains an α,β-unsaturated ketone moiety (`-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`), which accounts for the two 1H doublets and the second methyl singlet. The molecular formula of this product is C₁₁H₁₂O, which is consistent with the starting material. The predicted NMR signals for this compound align well with the experimental data.\n\n### Step 2: Identification of Compound X\n\nThe reaction is a rearrangement of an epoxide (Compound X) to a ketone (the product identified above), catalyzed by 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) at elevated temperature. This type of reaction is known as the Meinwald rearrangement. The DABCO-mediated Meinwald rearrangement of a terminal epoxide substituted with an aryl or vinyl group specifically yields a methyl ketone.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options for Compound X:\n\n*   **A) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** The molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O. However, rearrangement of this compound would not form a *p*-tolyl group.\n*   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O. This compound is a terminal epoxide substituted with a vinyl group that is attached to a *p*-tolyl group (`(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-`). According to the known mechanism, this starting material would rearrange to form the corresponding methyl ketone, which is (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This perfectly matches the product identified from the NMR data.\n*   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This is not a terminal epoxide. Its rearrangement would not yield the identified methyl ketone product and also lacks the *p*-tolyl group.\n\nTherefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, which rearranges to (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n<<<C>>>"
