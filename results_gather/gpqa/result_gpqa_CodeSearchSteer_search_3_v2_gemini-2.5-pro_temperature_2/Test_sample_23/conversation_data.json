    "The chemical puzzle can be solved through a step-by-step logical deduction based on the provided reaction details and substance properties.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₙHₘ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(m × 1) / (n × 12 + m × 1)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7m = 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m = 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n\nThis `CₙH₂ₙ` formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since substance Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound, which identifies it as a cycloalkane. The problem also states that Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y yielding only cyclohexane implies that all compounds in these mixtures share a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates the absence of reactive carbon-carbon double bonds. We already know that one component of Y is substance Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\nLet the other component be B. The hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane and B) under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. Since cyclohexane is already fully saturated, only component B would react. For B to be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, it must have a C₆ skeleton. Because mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, B is either a saturated isomer of cyclohexane or an aromatic compound. Aromatic compounds like benzene are stable and do not react with bromine water under normal conditions. The hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane. Therefore, the second component of mixture Y is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\nSo, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X\n\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that, when heated with a platinum catalyst, undergoes disproportionation to form the equimolar mixture Y ({cyclohexane, benzene}). The reaction is:\n**Mixture X → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆**\n\nLet the two liquids in mixture X be X₁ (C₆Hₐ) and X₂ (C₆Hₙ). Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture and produces an equimolar mixture, we can write a balanced chemical equation:\n**C₆Hₐ + C₆Hₙ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆**\n\nBy conserving the number of hydrogen atoms, we find that `a + n = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n\nThe problem states that mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning at least one of its components is unsaturated (contains C=C double bonds). It is also specified that there are no conjugated double bonds in these molecules. Finally, the hydrogenation of both components of mixture X must yield cyclohexane, confirming they both have a C₆ ring structure.\n\nThe likely candidates for the components of X are unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds:\n*   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Contains one double bond and does not have conjugated bonds.\n*   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**: Contains two non-conjugated double bonds. (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n\nIf we take X₁ as cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀, a=10) and X₂ as cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈, n=8), the sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our derived hydrogen balance.\n\nThe disproportionation reaction is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Over a platinum catalyst, the cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) can be dehydrogenated to benzene (C₆H₆), while the cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n**C₆H₁₀ (Cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₁₂ (Cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (Benzene)**\n\nThis proposed composition for mixture X fits all the given conditions.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) = 8\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
