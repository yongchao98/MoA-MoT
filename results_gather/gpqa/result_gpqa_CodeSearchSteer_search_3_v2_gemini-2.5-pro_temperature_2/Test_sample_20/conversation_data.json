    "Here is the analysis to determine the correct compounds for each part of the question.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible isomers. For keto-enol tautomerism, a key requirement is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure of benzoquinone features a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups opposite each other. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Due to the absence of alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has alpha-hydrogens on the carbons situated between the carbonyl groups. It can undergo tautomerization to form its enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound, which strongly favors its formation. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral compounds, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common source of chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (at the \"2\" position) bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). Because it possesses this chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with a methoxycarbonyl group attached to each of the double-bonded carbons. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral. Lacking chirality, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   Compound A (no tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
