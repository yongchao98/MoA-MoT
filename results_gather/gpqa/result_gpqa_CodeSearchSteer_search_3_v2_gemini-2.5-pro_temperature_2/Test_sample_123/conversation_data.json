    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the required Lorentz factor.\n\n### Understanding the Physics\n\nThe problem involves two key concepts from physics:\n1.  **Radioactive Decay:** The number of particles, N, that remain after a time, t, from an initial sample, N₀, is described by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ)`, where τ is the mean proper lifetime of the particle. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's own rest frame.\n2.  **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving clock runs slower as observed from a stationary reference frame. The time elapsed in the particle's rest frame (proper time, `t_proper`) is related to the time elapsed in the laboratory frame (lab time, `t_lab`) by the formula: `t_lab = γ * t_proper`, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### Setting up the Equations\n\nLet `f` be the fraction of particles that reach the detector. This is the fraction of particles that have not decayed after traveling a distance `R` (the detector radius).\n`f = N / N₀ = exp(-t_proper / τ)`\n\nThe time it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector in the laboratory frame is:\n`t_lab = R / v`\nSince the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n`t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\nFrom the time dilation formula, the proper time experienced by the particle is:\n`t_proper = t_lab / γ = R / (c * γ)`\n\nBy substituting `t_proper` into the decay equation, we get the fraction of surviving particles as a function of the Lorentz factor γ:\n`f = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ))`\n\n### Scenario 1: Initial Conditions\n\nWe are given:\n*   Detector Radius `R` = 30 m\n*   Initial Lorentz factor `γ₁` = 20\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector `f₁` = 1/3\n\nUsing our derived formula:\n`1/3 = exp(-R / (c * γ₁ * τ))`\n`1/3 = exp(-R / (c * 20 * τ))`\n\nTo solve for the unknown term `R/(c*τ)`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -R / (c * 20 * τ)`\n`-ln(3) = -R / (c * 20 * τ)`\n`ln(3) = R / (c * 20 * τ)`\n\nThis gives us a value for the constant term `R/(c*τ)`:\n`R / (c * τ) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n### Scenario 2: Finding the New Lorentz Factor\n\nWe want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the fraction of particles reaching the detector is `f₂` = 2/3.\n\nUsing the same general formula:\n`2/3 = exp(-R / (c * γ₂ * τ))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ)`\n`ln(3/2) = R / (c * γ₂ * τ)`\n\nThis gives us another expression for the constant `R/(c*τ)`:\n`R / (c * τ) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n### Solving for γ₂\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for `R/(c*τ)` from Scenario 1 and Scenario 2:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is closest to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
