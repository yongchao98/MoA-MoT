    "To determine the time elapsed for the astronaut, we need to perform a time dilation calculation. This requires two key pieces of information: the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the time dilation formula from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way. According to various astronomical observations, its distance from Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n\n### 2. Time as Observed from Earth\n\nFirst, we calculate the travel time from the perspective of an observer on Earth. This is a straightforward calculation of time = distance / velocity.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** 163,000 light-years\n*   **Velocity (v):** 0.99999987 *c* (where *c* is the speed of light)\n\nTime for an Earth observer = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 *c*) ≈ 163,000.02 years.\n\nFrom Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 163,000 years.\n\n### 3. Time Dilation and the Astronaut's Perspective\n\nDue to the effects of special relativity, time for the moving astronaut will pass much slower than for the stationary observer on Earth. This phenomenon is known as time dilation. The formula to relate the two timeframes is:\n\nT = T₀ / √(1 - v²/c²) \n\nWhere:\n*   **T** is the time observed by the stationary observer (on Earth).\n*   **T₀** is the proper time, as measured by the moving observer (the astronaut).\n*   **v** is the velocity of the spacecraft.\n*   **c** is the speed of light.\n\nThe term `1 / √(1 - v²/c²)` is called the Lorentz factor (γ). We can rearrange the formula to solve for the astronaut's time:\n\nT₀ = T * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nLet's calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) for the given speed:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\nγ ≈ 1961.16\n\nNow we can find the time experienced by the astronaut:\n\nAstronaut's Time (T₀) = Earth Time (T) / γ\nT₀ ≈ 163,000.02 years / 1961.16\nT₀ ≈ 83.11 years\n\nThe journey will take approximately 83.1 years from the astronaut's point of view. Since the astronaut was 22 years old at the start of the trip, they would be approximately 22 + 83 = 105 years old upon arrival. This is well within their average lifespan of 150 years, so option B is incorrect. The closest answer to our calculation is 81 years. The slight difference is likely due to using a slightly different distance to the LMC for the problem's intended calculation (using a distance of ~158,800 light-years yields ~81 years).\n\nBased on the calculation, the elapsed time for the astronaut is closest to 81 years.\n\n<<<D>>>"
