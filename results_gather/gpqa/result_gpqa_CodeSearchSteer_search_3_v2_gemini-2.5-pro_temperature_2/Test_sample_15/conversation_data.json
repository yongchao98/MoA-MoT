    "To determine if a compound will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess its chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and is not a meso compound (an achiral compound with stereocenters).\n\nHere's an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The carbons of the double bond are sp2 hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The entire molecule is planar and therefore has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters (3aR, 7aS). Naming a compound with (R) or (S) designations indicates that it is a single enantiomer of a chiral substance. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). However, the (2R,3S) isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry that makes the molecule achiral, despite the presence of chiral centers. This is a classic example of a meso compound, which is optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This isomer is a diastereomer of the meso form. It does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and is therefore a chiral molecule. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The (R) designation in the name explicitly defines a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The carbon atom attached to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a stereocenter. Consequently, this compound is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, also known as cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has three stereocenters. However, due to the high degree of symmetry (it possesses both a three-fold axis of rotation and planes of symmetry), the molecule is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The chemical structure is CC(C)CC(=O)C1CCCC1. A review of this structure reveals that it does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is attached to two identical methyl groups. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<B>>>"
