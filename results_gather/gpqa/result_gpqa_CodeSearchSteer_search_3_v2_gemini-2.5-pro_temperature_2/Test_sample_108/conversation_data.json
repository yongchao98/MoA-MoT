    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\nThe initial system is a bound pair of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   `L = S` indicates the orbital angular momentum is `L(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` means the total angular momentum is `J(NN_initial) = 0`.\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. State the Conservation Laws\nThe problem requires us to use the conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The initial angular momentum `J(NN_initial)` is 0. The final state consists of the NN pair and the particle X. Assuming the particle X has no intrinsic spin (or it's not relevant to the lowercase letter notation), the final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN pair's total angular momentum `J(NN_final)` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `L(X)`. For the initial `J=0` to be conserved, the final total angular momentum must also be 0. This can only happen if the magnitudes of the final state angular momenta are equal: `J(NN_final) = L(X)`.\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):** The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n    *   `P(initial) = (-1)^L(NN_initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   `P(final) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`. (We are given `P(X) = -1`).\n    *   Setting `P(initial) = P(final)` gives: `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + L(X) + 1)`, which means the exponent `L(NN_final) + L(X) + 1` must be an even number. In other words, `L(NN_final) + L(X)` must be **odd**.\n\n### 3. Apply the Pauli Statistics Condition for the Final State\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = 0`. The given Pauli statistics rule is `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   Substituting `T(NN_final) = 0`, we get `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This implies that the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now check each option against three conditions:\n1.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** `J(NN_final) = L(X)`\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN_final) + L(X)` is odd.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` is odd.\n\n---\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `L(X)=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN_final) = 3`, `L(X) = 3`. Condition `3=3` is **met**.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN_final) + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). Condition is **met**.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). Condition is **met**.\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n---\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `L(X)=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN_final) = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. Condition `1=1` is **met**.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN_final) + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). Condition is **met**.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). Condition is **met**.\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n---\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `L(X)=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN_final) = 0`, `L(X) = 0`. Condition `0=0` is **met**.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN_final) + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). Condition is **met**.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). Condition is **NOT met**.\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli statistics requirement for a final state with `T=0`.\n\n---\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   This option proposes a final NN state of `7D1`. The `2S+1` value is 7, which would mean the total spin of the two nucleons is `S=3`.\n*   However, nucleons are spin-1/2 particles. The combination of two spin-1/2 particles can only result in a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A total spin of `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Therefore, this transition is not permitted because the final `7D1` state is not a valid state for a two-nucleon system.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth (C) and (D) describe unpermitted transitions. However, the reason for the prohibition is different. Option (D) is forbidden because the state `7D1` is physically impossible for two nucleons. Option (C) involves a physically possible state (`3P0`) but is forbidden by the selection rules governing the reaction, specifically the Pauli principle which was explicitly cited in the problem. In the context of such physics problems, the question typically aims to test the application of reaction selection rules. The Pauli rule is a key piece of information given, and option (C) is the one that violates it.\n\n<<<C>>>"
