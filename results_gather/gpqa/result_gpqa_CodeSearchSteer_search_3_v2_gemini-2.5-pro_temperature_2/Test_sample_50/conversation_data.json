    "To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images. A point charge *q* at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R* induces an image charge *q'* inside the sphere.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and its Location**:\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n    *   It is located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center and the charge *q*.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**:\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to the distance *d* from the center of the sphere. This can be calculated as half of the potential energy of the interaction between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'*. The factor of 1/2 is included because the potential energy is stored in the electric field, and this method avoids double-counting the energy.\n\n    The potential energy `U` is given by the interaction energy of the point charge *q* with the potential created by the image charge `q'`. The potential at the location of *q* (a distance *d* from the center) due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   The distance between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'* is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    *   The potential `V'` at the location of *q* due to *q'* is `V' = (1 / 4πε₀) * q' / (d - b)`. Using `k = 1 / 4πε₀`, this becomes `V' = k * q' / (d - b)`.\n\n    Substituting the values of *q'* and *(d-b)*:\n    `V' = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    `V' = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    The potential energy `U` of the charge *q* in this potential is:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V'`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Alternatively, we can calculate the work done by integrating the force on the charge *q* as it is brought from infinity to the distance *d*. The force on charge *q* is the force between *q* and its image *q'*.\n    *   Force `F = k * q * q' / (distance)^2 = k * q * [-q(R/d)] / [d - R^2/d]^2`\n    *   The work done, which is the potential energy, is the integral of this force from infinity to *d*, which also yields the same result.\n\n    Comparing our result `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` with the given options:\n    *   A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    *   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
