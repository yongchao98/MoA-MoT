    "### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n1.  **Define System Parameters and Conditions:**\n    *   **Star:** Radius `R_s = 1.5 * R_sun`. Using the standard solar radius `R_sun = 6.96 x 10^8 m`. `R_s = 1.5 * 6.96 x 10^8 m = 1.044 x 10^9 m`.\n    *   **Planet 1:** Orbital period `P1 = 3 days`. Transit impact parameter `b1 = 0.2`. The impact parameter is the projected distance between the planet's center and the star's center during transit, normalized by the star's radius.\n    *   **Planet 2:** Radius `R_p2 = 2.5 * R_earth`. Using the mean Earth radius `R_earth = 6.371 x 10^6 m`. `R_p2 = 2.5 * 6.371 x 10^6 m = 1.59275 x 10^7 m`.\n    *   **Shared Properties:** Both planets have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane, which means they have the same orbital inclination, `i`.\n    *   **Condition for Events:** We need to find the maximum period for Planet 2 to exhibit both transit and occultation events. A transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its star, and an occultation (secondary eclipse) is when it passes behind. For a system with a circular orbit viewed with a specific inclination, if a transit occurs, an occultation will also occur. The maximum period corresponds to the maximum possible semi-major axis (`a`) that still allows for a transit. A transit event occurs if any part of the planet crosses the star's disk. This means the maximum projected separation between the centers of the star and planet must be equal to the sum of their radii (`R_s + R_p2`).\n\n2.  **Determine the System's Orbital Inclination:**\n    *   The impact parameter `b` is given by the formula: `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a` is the semi-major axis and `i` is the inclination.\n    *   For Planet 1, we have: `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s = 0.2`.\n    *   From this, we can express the constant term `cos(i)` for the system: `cos(i) = (0.2 * R_s) / a1`. Since the orbital plane is the same for both planets, this `cos(i)` is valid for Planet 2 as well.\n\n3.  **Find the Maximum Semi-Major Axis for Planet 2:**\n    *   For a transit of Planet 2 to occur, the maximum allowable projected distance between the centers is `R_s + R_p2`. This is the condition for a grazing transit.\n    *   The projected distance for Planet 2 at its maximum semi-major axis (`a2_max`) is `a2_max * cos(i)`.\n    *   Therefore, the condition for the limiting case is: `a2_max * cos(i) = R_s + R_p2`.\n    *   We can now solve for `a2_max` by substituting our expression for `cos(i)`:\n        `a2_max * [(0.2 * R_s) / a1] = R_s + R_p2`\n    *   Rearranging for `a2_max`:\n        `a2_max = (R_s + R_p2) * a1 / (0.2 * R_s)`\n        `a2_max = (a1 / 0.2) * (1 + R_p2 / R_s)`\n        `a2_max = 5 * a1 * (1 + R_p2 / R_s)`\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`): `P^2 ∝ a^3`.\n    *   For two planets orbiting the same star, we can write this as a ratio: `(P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3`.\n    *   Solving for `P2`, we get: `P2 = P1 * (a2 / a1)^(3/2)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Maximum Orbital Period for Planet 2:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for the maximum semi-major axis (`a2_max`) into the period relationship:\n        `P2_max = P1 * (a2_max / a1)^(3/2)`\n        `P2_max = P1 * ([5 * a1 * (1 + R_p2 / R_s)] / a1)^(3/2)`\n        `P2_max = P1 * [5 * (1 + R_p2 / R_s)]^(3/2)`\n    *   Now, we need the numerical value for the ratio `R_p2 / R_s`:\n        `R_p2 = 1.59275 x 10^7 m`\n        `R_s = 1.044 x 10^9 m`\n        `R_p2 / R_s = (1.59275 x 10^7) / (1.044 x 10^9) ≈ 0.015256`\n    *   Now plug all the values into the equation for `P2_max`:\n        `P2_max = 3 * [5 * (1 + 0.015256)]^(3/2)`\n        `P2_max = 3 * [5 * (1.015256)]^(3/2)`\n        `P2_max = 3 * (5.07628)^(3/2)`\n        `P2_max = 3 * (11.438)`\n        `P2_max ≈ 34.31 days`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Simplest Case:**\n    *   Often, the planetary radius is considered negligible compared to the stellar radius for calculating the transit condition. In this simplified case, the condition for a transit to occur is `b2 <= 1`.\n    *   This leads to `a2_max * cos(i) = R_s`.\n    *   Following the same steps:\n        `a2_max * [(0.2 * R_s) / a1] = R_s`\n        `a2_max = a1 / 0.2 = 5 * a1`\n    *   Calculating the period:\n        `P2_max = P1 * (a2_max / a1)^(3/2)`\n        `P2_max = 3 * (5 * a1 / a1)^(3/2)`\n        `P2_max = 3 * 5^(3/2)`\n        `P2_max = 3 * sqrt(125) ≈ 3 * 11.18 = 33.54 days`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated value of ~33.54 days from the simplified model matches one of the options exactly. The more precise calculation gives ~34.31 days, which is also very close. Given the options, the intended answer likely uses the simplified condition where the impact parameter `b` must be less than or equal to 1.\n\nFinal calculation based on the simplified (and most common) transit condition:\n`P2_max = 3 * (1 / 0.2)^(3/2) = 3 * 5^(1.5) = 3 * 11.1803... ≈ 33.54` days.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
