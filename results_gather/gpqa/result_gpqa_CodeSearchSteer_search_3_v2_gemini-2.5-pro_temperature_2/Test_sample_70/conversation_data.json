    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of radiative equilibrium and orbital mechanics. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates back into space.\n\n### Key Formulas:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the equilibrium temperature can be expressed as:\n    *T_eq ∝ (1/a)¹ᐟ²*\n    where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the distance from the star). This relationship stems from the fact that stellar energy received by the planet decreases with the square of the distance (1/a²), and the planet's radiated energy is proportional to T_eq⁴. The problem states the planets have the same albedo, and they orbit the same star, so other factors in the full equilibrium temperature formula cancel out when taking a ratio.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the law is:\n    *P² ∝ a³*\n    This can be rearranged to show the relationship between the semi-major axis and the period:\n    *a ∝ P²ᐟ³*\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n\nFirst, we need to establish a relationship between the equilibrium temperature and the orbital period. By substituting the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature proportionality, we get:\n\n*   *T_eq ∝ (1 / P²ᐟ³)¹ᐟ²*\n*   *T_eq ∝ 1 / P¹ᐟ³* or *T_eq ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³*\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet\\_4 and Planet\\_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2):\n\n*   *T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_4 / P_2)⁻¹ᐟ³ = (P_2 / P_4)¹ᐟ³*\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5. From this, we can identify the period values for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n*   Orbital period of Planet\\_2 (P₂) corresponds to the value 2.\n*   Orbital period of Planet\\_4 (P₄) corresponds to the value 3.5.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into our derived formula:\n\n*   *T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³*\n*   *T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)¹ᐟ³*\n*   *T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)¹ᐟ³*\n\nCalculating the cube root of approximately 0.5714 gives:\n\n*   *T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.83*\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet\\_4 and Planet\\_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
