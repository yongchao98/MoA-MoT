    "When solving higher-dimensional heat equations, the problem is often transformed using the method of lines into a large system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The solution to this system involves the matrix exponential function. For implicit methods, which are desirable for their stability properties, this function is often approximated by a rational function (a fraction of two polynomials).\n\nThe key to converting the inherently sequential process of solving these implicit systems into a parallel one lies in the mathematical properties of this rational approximation. Specifically, if the rational function can be decomposed into a sum of simpler fractions—a technique known as partial fraction decomposition—the problem changes fundamentally.\n\nInstead of solving one large, complex system, the partial fraction decomposition allows the problem to be split into several smaller, independent linear systems. Each of these smaller systems can be solved simultaneously on a separate processor. The final solution is then obtained by combining the results from each processor. This \"divide and conquer\" strategy is the essence of the parallel algorithm in this context.\n\nTherefore, the linear partial fraction decomposition of the fractional (or rational) approximation is the essential factor that enables the conversion of a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. This technique transforms a sequential bottleneck into a set of independent tasks suitable for parallel computation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
