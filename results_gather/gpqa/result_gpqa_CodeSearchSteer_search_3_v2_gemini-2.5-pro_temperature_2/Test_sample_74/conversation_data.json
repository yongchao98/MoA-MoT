  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    "To understand why the protein was not overexpressed, we must analyze the provided DNA sequence, paying close attention to the genetic code.\n\n1.  **Identify the components of the engineered gene:** The construct is designed to have the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag sequence at the N-terminus, followed by the coding sequence for the GADD45G protein. The entire sequence should begin with a start codon and end just before a stop codon.\n2.  **Analyze the start of the sequence:** The provided DNA sequence is:\n    `5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC AAATGA... 3'`\n3.  **Translate the sequence into amino acids:** Protein translation starts at the `ATG` start codon. We can then read the sequence in groups of three nucleotides (codons) to determine the amino acid sequence.\n    *   **ATG**: Methionine (Start codon)\n    *   **TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC**: This corresponds to the amino acid sequence Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala, which is the standard sequence for the HA tag. So far, the construct is as designed.\n    *   **AAA**: Lysine\n    *   **TGA**: **STOP**\n\nThe analysis reveals a `TGA` codon immediately following the codon for Lysine. TGA is one of the three stop codons (along with TAA and TAG) that signal the ribosome to terminate translation. The presence of this premature stop codon means that after synthesizing the start methionine, the HA tag, and one lysine residue, the ribosome would dissociate from the messenger RNA, releasing a very short, non-functional peptide. This prevents the synthesis of the full-length GADD45G protein, explaining the experimental failure.\n\nEvaluating the given options:\n*   **A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect. The stop codon in the sequence is TGA, not UAA. Furthermore, stop codons are generally not recognized by tRNAs but by release factors that terminate translation.\n*   **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is the correct conclusion. A premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the coding sequence caused translation to halt shortly after it began.\n*   **C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. The translation of the HA tag sequence shows it is correct and does not contain a missense mutation.\n*   **D) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be important for the stability and proper folding of fusion proteins, their absence does not inherently cause a complete failure of expression. The presence of a premature stop codon is a more direct and definitive cause for the observed problem.\n\n<<<B>>>"
