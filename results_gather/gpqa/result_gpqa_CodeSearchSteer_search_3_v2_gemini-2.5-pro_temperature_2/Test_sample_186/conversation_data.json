    "### Summary of Findings & Analysis\n\nTo determine which stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a single 8.2-meter VLT telescope, we must evaluate each star's apparent magnitude and observability from the Paranal Observatory and compare this with the instrument's performance. A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 is achieved in a one-hour exposure.\n\n**1. ESPRESSO's Limiting Magnitude:**\nThe documentation for ESPRESSO indicates its performance capabilities. In the 1-Unit Telescope (1-UT) mode, an S/N of 10 is achieved for a star with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) of 17.1 with three 20-minute exposures, which is equivalent to a single one-hour exposure. Therefore, the limiting magnitude for our detectability criterion (S/N ≥ 10 in 1 hour) is approximately **m_V = 17.1**. Stars with an apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17.1 will be detectable.\n\n**2. Observability from Paranal:**\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of about -24.6 degrees. A celestial object's observability is determined by its declination.\n\n**3. Star-by-Star Analysis:**\n\n**a) Canopus:**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude (m_V):** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky with an apparent magnitude of -0.74.\n*   **Observability:** Its declination is approximately -52° 41', making it easily observable from Paranal in the Southern Hemisphere.\n*   **Detectability:** With m_V = -0.74, it is significantly brighter than the limiting magnitude of 17.1.\n*   **Conclusion:** Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris (North Star):**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude (m_V):** Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about 1.98.\n*   **Observability:** Its declination is very close to +90° North (+89° 15′ 50.8″). From a southern latitude like Paranal's (-24.6°), Polaris is permanently below the horizon and therefore not observable.\n*   **Conclusion:** Polaris is **not detectable** from Paranal.\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15 at 10 pc:**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude (m_V):** Using the distance modulus formula, m_V = M_V + 5*log10(d) - 5, where M_V = 15 and d = 10 pc.\n    m_V = 15 + 5*log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5*(1) - 5 = **15.0**.\n*   **Observability:** With a declination of 0 degrees, it is located on the celestial equator and is observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 15.0 is brighter than the 17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15 at 200 pc:**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude (m_V):**\n    m_V = 15 + 5*log10(200) - 5 = 15 + 5*(2.301) - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = **21.5**.\n*   **Observability:** Declination of 0 degrees makes it observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the 17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15 at 5 pc:**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude (m_V):**\n    m_V = 15 + 5*log10(5) - 5 = 15 + 5*(0.699) - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = **13.5**.\n*   **Observability:** Declination of 0 degrees makes it observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the 17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15 at 50 pc:**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude (m_V):**\n    m_V = 15 + 5*log10(50) - 5 = 15 + 5*(1.699) - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = **18.5**.\n*   **Observability:** Declination of 0 degrees makes it observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the 17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **not detectable**.\n\n### Final Count\n\nThe detectable stars are:\n1.  Canopus (a)\n2.  Star with M_V = 15 at 10 pc (c)\n3.  Star with M_V = 15 at 5 pc (e)\n\nA total of **3** stars from the list would be detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
