    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the principles of quantum mechanics for calculating the probability of a measurement outcome.\n\n1.  **Define the State Vector and the Observable Matrix:**\n    The state of the system is given by the column matrix (vector) `|ψ⟩`:\n    `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\n    The observable is represented by the matrix `P`:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n2.  **Normalize the State Vector:**\n    First, we need to ensure the state vector `|ψ⟩` is normalized. The squared norm of `|ψ⟩` is:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n    The normalization constant is `1/√6`. The normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n    `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\n3.  **Find the Eigenvector for the Desired Eigenvalue:**\n    We need to find the probability that the measurement will yield 0. This means we are interested in the eigenvector of `P` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. Let's call this eigenvector `|v₀⟩`. We find it by solving the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩ = 0`:\n\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n\n    This gives us a system of linear equations:\n    *   From the first row: `(1/√2) * y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    *   From the second row: `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\n    So, any eigenvector corresponding to `λ=0` is of the form `[k, 0, -k]^T`. We can choose `k=1` for simplicity.\n    `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n4.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    Next, we normalize the eigenvector `|v₀⟩`. The squared norm is:\n    `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`\n    The normalized eigenvector, `|λ=0⟩`, is:\n    `|λ=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring the eigenvalue `λ=0` is given by the squared magnitude of the inner product of the normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩` and the normalized eigenvector `|λ=0⟩`.\n    `Prob(λ=0) = |⟨λ=0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n\n    First, let's compute the inner product `⟨λ=0|ψ_norm⟩`:\n    `⟨λ=0|ψ_norm⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) · ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1] )`\n    `= (1/√12) * ( (1 * -1) + (0 * 2) + (-1 * 1) )`\n    `= (1/√12) * (-1 + 0 - 1)`\n    `= -2 / √12`\n    `= -2 / (2√3)`\n    `= -1 / √3`\n\n    Now, we square the absolute value of this result to get the probability:\n    `Prob(λ=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\nTherefore, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
