    # --- Step 1: Calculate Initial Energy ---
    # The problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving," so we assume the initial
    # kinetic energy is negligible. The initial energy is the sum of the rest mass
    # energies of the proton and antiproton.

    # The final energy is the total energy of the four A particles. By symmetry,
    # they all have the same speed (v) and thus the same Lorentz factor (gamma).
    # E_final = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2

    # --- Step 3: Solve for the Lorentz Factor (gamma) ---
    # By conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final

    # --- Step 4: Solve for Velocity (v/c, or beta) ---
    # The relationship between gamma and beta is: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)
    # Rearranging for beta: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)
    beta_squared = 1 - (1 / (gamma**2))
