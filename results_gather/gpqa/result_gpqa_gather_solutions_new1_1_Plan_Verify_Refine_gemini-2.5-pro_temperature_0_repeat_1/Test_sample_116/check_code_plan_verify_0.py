Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.

**1. Understand the Core Concept: Optical Isomerism**
A compound shows optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The two most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are:
*   **Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.
*   **Axial Chirality:** Restricted rotation around a bond, which creates a non-planar structure that lacks symmetry. A classic example is atropisomerism in substituted biphenyls.

A molecule is **achiral** (and thus not optically active) if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.

**2. Analyze Each Compound**

*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system with two phenyl rings connected by a single bond.
    *   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** The positions adjacent to the connecting bond (ortho-positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups (nitro -NO₂ and dimethyl carboxylate -COOCH₃).
    *   **Analysis:** These bulky groups sterically hinder rotation around the central single bond, locking the two rings in a twisted, non-planar conformation. This arrangement lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, a form of axial chirality.
    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.

*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
    *   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate, its formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.
    *   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** We must check for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.
    *   **Analysis:** The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:
        1.  -H (hydrogen)
        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)
        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)
        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)
    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has a single chiral center, the molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.

*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**
    *   **Structure:** (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.
    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** We must check for elements of symmetry.
    *   **Analysis:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.
    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and **does not show optical isomerism**.

*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**
    *   **Structure:** The *trans*-isomer of CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.
    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** This is a planar molecule.
    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.
    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and **does not show optical isomerism**.

**3. Synthesize and Decide**
*   Compounds that show optical isomerism: **1 and 2**.
*   Compounds that do not: **3 and 4**.

Matching this result to the given options:
A) 1 and 2
B) 2 and 3
C) 1, 2 and 4
D) 3 and 4

The correct option is **A**.

A review of the candidate answers shows that while many of them correctly identify compounds 1 and 2 as the optically active ones, they frequently select the wrong corresponding letter. The chemical reasoning across the majority of answers is sound and points to the same conclusion.
