    This function checks the correctness of the final answer for a chemistry question involving two reactions.

    The function verifies two main constraints:
    1.  Reaction A is a Wittig rearrangement. The major product, given the options, is 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol.
    2.  Reaction B is a Cope rearrangement, which is an isomerization. The starting material is a "hexahydro" derivative,
        so the product must also be a "hexahydro" derivative to conserve the molecular formula.
