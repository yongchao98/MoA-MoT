    This function verifies the answer to the physics problem by recalculating the
    involved energies from fundamental principles and comparing their magnitudes.

    The problem compares:
    1. Paramagnetic coupling energy (<H>): The energy of an atom's magnetic moment
       in an external magnetic field (Zeeman effect).
    2. Transition energy (ΔE): The energy of a photon with a given wavelength.

    The function checks if the provided answer, C (<H> << ΔE), is consistent
    with the calculated physics.
