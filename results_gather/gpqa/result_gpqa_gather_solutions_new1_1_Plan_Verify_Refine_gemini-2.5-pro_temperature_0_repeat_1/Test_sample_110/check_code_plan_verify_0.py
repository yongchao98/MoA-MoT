    # --- Step 1: Determine the correct product for Reaction A ---
    # Reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)
    # Analysis: This is a Michael addition. The base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the ketone.
    # The ketone has two alpha-carbons: C2 and C6.
    # C2 is quaternary and has no alpha-protons.
    # C6 is tertiary and has one alpha-proton.
    # Therefore, deprotonation occurs exclusively at C6.
    # The C6 enolate attacks ethyl acrylate. A new bond forms between C6 of the ketone
    # and the beta-carbon of the acrylate.
    # Naming convention in options treats the propanoate as the parent chain.
    # The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at C3 of the propanoate.
    # To name the substituent, the point of attachment (original C6) is numbered as new C1.
    # - New C1 has a methyl group.
    # - New C2 is the carbonyl carbon (oxo).
    # - New C3 has an ethyl and a methyl group.
    # This gives the substituent name: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).

    # --- Step 2: Determine the correct product for Reaction B ---
    # Reaction: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)
    # Analysis: This is a nitro-Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon
    # alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane.
    # The resulting carbanion attacks the beta-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.
    # The product structure is CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN.
    # To name it, the nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group (C1).
    # The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile is 6 carbons long -> hexanenitrile.
    # Numbering from the nitrile: CN(1)-CH2(2)-CH(CH3)(3)-CH(NO2)(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6).
