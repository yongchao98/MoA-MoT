    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the solar neutrino flux problem.

    This function models the physics of the problem:
    1. It recognizes that the pp-III branch (source of 8B neutrinos) has stopped.
    2. It calculates the remaining flux in the two specified energy bands.
       - Band 1 (700-800 keV) is populated only by CNO neutrinos.
       - Band 2 (800-900 keV) is overwhelmingly dominated by the 7Be neutrino line, plus a small CNO contribution.
    3. It computes the ratio of these fluxes and finds the closest multiple-choice option.
    4. It compares this result with the provided LLM answer.
