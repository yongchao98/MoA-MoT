    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.
    # The provided options are: A) c3, B) c2h, C) cs, D) d2h
    # The final answer to check is 'B', which corresponds to 'c2h'.
    answer_to_check_key = 'B'

    # --- Step-by-step Chemical Analysis ---

    # Step 1: Nitration of Toluene
    # Toluene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution.
    # The methyl group is an ortho, para-director. The para product is the major isomer
    # due to reduced steric hindrance. We follow the major product pathway.
    product_1 = "p-nitrotoluene"

    # Step 2: Oxidation of Product 1
    # p-nitrotoluene + MnO2/H2SO4 -> Oxidation of the benzylic methyl group.
    # The subsequent reaction (Step 3) is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, which requires
    # an aldehyde as the electrophile. A carboxylic acid would not work.
    # Therefore, the logical intermediate is the aldehyde.
    product_2 = "p-nitrobenzaldehyde"

    # Step 3: Condensation with Acetone
    # p-nitrobenzaldehyde + acetone + NaOH -> Claisen-Schmidt condensation.
    # Acetone has two reactive alpha-carbon sites. With sufficient aldehyde, a double
    # condensation is the expected outcome, leading to a highly stable and symmetric product.
    # This is considered the most likely intended product over single condensation.
    product_3 = "(1E,4E)-1,5-bis(4-nitrophenyl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one"

    # Step 4: Symmetry Analysis of Product 3
    # The structure is O2N-Ph-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH=CH-Ph-NO2.
    # Assuming a planar conformation for maximum conjugation, we identify its symmetry elements:
    # - A C2 axis passing through the C=O bond, perpendicular to the molecular plane.
    # - A horizontal mirror plane (sigma_h) which is the plane of the molecule itself.
    # - A center of inversion (i) located at the carbonyl carbon atom.
    # A molecule with the symmetry elements {E, C2, sigma_h, i} belongs to the C2h point group.
    derived_point_group = "c2h"

    # Check if the derived point group matches the value from the provided answer key.
