def check_correctness_of_answer():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the physics problem.

    The problem asks for the net potential energy of a charge q placed a distance d
    from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R.

    The correct formula, derived using the method of images, is:
    U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)

    This function will:
    1. Define Python functions for each of the multiple-choice options.
    2. Identify the function corresponding to the given answer ('A').
    3. Compare the output of the chosen function against the correct physical formula using numerical examples.
    4. Verify that the chosen formula satisfies key physical constraints (limiting cases).
