            # Principle: Increased volume (dilution) can decrease the rate.

        # Option C: Increased pH
        if option == 'C':
            # Principle 1: The reaction was proceeding at pH 1, implying it is acid-catalyzed (rate depends on [H+]).
            # Principle 2: An increased pH means a decreased [H+] concentration.
            # Principle 3: For an acid-catalyzed reaction, decreasing the catalyst concentration slows the reaction.
            # Consistency Check: This matches the observation that the rate became slower.
            # Further Consistency: The addition of a base to neutralize H+ is an exothermic reaction, which explains why the container got hot.
            # Conclusion: This option explains all observations coherently.
