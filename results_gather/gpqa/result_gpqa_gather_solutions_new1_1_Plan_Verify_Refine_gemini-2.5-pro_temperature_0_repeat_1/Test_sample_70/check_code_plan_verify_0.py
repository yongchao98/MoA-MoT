def check_planetary_temperature_ratio():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the exoplanet temperature ratio problem.

    The key physical principles are:
    1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) is proportional to the inverse square root of the
       orbital distance (a): T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).
    2. Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional
       to the cube of the orbital distance: P^2 ∝ a^3, which means a ∝ P^(2/3).

    Combining these, we find the relationship between temperature and period:
    T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) => T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3).

    Therefore, the ratio of temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is (P4 / P2)^(-1/3).
