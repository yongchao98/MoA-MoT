def check_non_gaussianity_calculation():
    """
    Calculates the non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given Schrödinger cat state
    and compares it to the provided answer.

    The calculation follows these steps:
    1. The non-Gaussianity measure nG = S(tau) - S(rho).
    2. For a pure state like the one given, the entropy S(rho) is 0.
    3. Thus, nG = S(tau), the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.
    4. The reference state tau has the same first and second moments as the cat state.
    5. For the given parameters (phi=-pi/4), the state is an odd cat state,
       which has a zero first moment (<a>=0).
    6. The second moments are <a^2> = alpha^2 and <n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2).
    7. The entropy S(tau) is calculated from the symplectic eigenvalue 'nu' of the
       covariance matrix, where nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2.
    8. The entropy formula is S(tau) = (nu+1/2)ln(nu+1/2) - (nu-1/2)ln(nu-1/2).
