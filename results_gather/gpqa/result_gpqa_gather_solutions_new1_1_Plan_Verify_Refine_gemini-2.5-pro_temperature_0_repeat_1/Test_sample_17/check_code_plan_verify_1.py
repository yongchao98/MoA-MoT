    # --- Problem Setup ---
    # Given values from the question
    # For Star 1:
    Si_Fe_1 = 0.3  # [Si/Fe]_1 in dex
    Fe_H_1 = 0.0   # [Fe/H]_1 in dex
    # For Star 2:
    Mg_Si_2 = 0.3  # [Mg/Si]_2 in dex
    Mg_H_2 = 0.0   # [Mg/H]_2 in dex

    # Multiple choice options from the question
    options = {'A': 3.9, 'B': 1.2, 'C': 12.6, 'D': 0.8}

    # The final answer from the LLM to be checked
    llm_final_choice = 'A'

    # --- Calculation ---
    # The core of the problem is to manipulate the abundance notation [X/Y].
    # The key identity is [A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C].

    # Step 1: Calculate the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen for Star 1, [Si/H]_1.
    # We use the identity: [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1
    Si_H_1 = Si_Fe_1 + Fe_H_1

    # Step 2: Calculate the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen for Star 2, [Si/H]_2.
    # We use the identity: [Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2
    # Rearranging for [Si/H]_2 gives: [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2
    Si_H_2 = Mg_H_2 - Mg_Si_2

    # Step 3: Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms.
    # The question asks for the ratio R = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2.
    # In logarithmic terms, log10(R) = log10((n_Si/n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_2).
    # From the definition of [X/Y], this difference is equal to [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2.
    log_ratio = Si_H_1 - Si_H_2

    # Step 4: Find the numerical value of the ratio.
    # R = 10^(log_ratio)
    calculated_ratio = 10**log_ratio

    # --- Verification ---
    # Check if the LLM's chosen option corresponds to the calculated value.
    llm_answer_value = options.get(llm_final_choice)

    if llm_answer_value is None:
        return f"Incorrect. The provided answer choice '{llm_final_choice}' is not a valid option from the set {list(options.keys())}."

    # Find the option that is numerically closest to our calculated result.
    # This is robust against potential floating point inaccuracies or rounding in the options.
    closest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - calculated_ratio))
