    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points to consider.

    **Step 1: Analyze the Overall Chemical Transformation**
    The question describes a two-step reaction sequence:
    1.  Treatment with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).
    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).

    This sequence achieves the dihydroxylation of an alkene. The first step, epoxidation with mCPBA, is a *syn*-addition. The second step, acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide with water, is an *anti*-addition. The net result of this sequence is an **anti-dihydroxylation** of the double bond.

    **Step 2: Determine the Product of Reaction 1**
    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, a *trans*-alkene.
    *   **Transformation:** Anti-dihydroxylation.
    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso** compound.
    *   **Product 1:** Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral compound: meso-octane-4,5-diol.

    **Step 3: Determine the Product of Reaction 2**
    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene.
    *   **Transformation:** Anti-dihydroxylation.
    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.
    *   **Product 2:** Reaction 2 produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.

    **Step 4: Characterize the Combined Product Mixture**
    The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:
    1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)
    2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)
    3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)

    The relationship between these isomers is crucial:
    *   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers**.
    *   Compound 1 (the meso compound) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.

    **Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram for Standard (Achiral) HPLC**
    *   **Principle:** A standard HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.
    *   **Separation of Enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they **cannot** be separated and will elute together as a single peak.
    *   **Separation of Diastereomers:** Diastereomers have different physical properties. Therefore, they **can** be separated and will elute at different times.
    *   **Prediction:** The racemic pair ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) will co-elute as one peak. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the pair, will have different properties and will elute as a second, separate peak.
    *   **Result:** **2 peaks** will be observed.

    **Step 6: Predict the Chromatogram for Chiral HPLC**
    *   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer.
    *   **Separation:** A chiral column can separate all stereoisomers from one another. It separates diastereomers and also resolves enantiomers.
    *   **Prediction:** All three unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated. The meso-diol will give one peak, the (4R,5R)-enantiomer will give a second peak, and the (4S,5S)-enantiomer will give a third peak.
    *   **Result:** **3 peaks** will be observed.

    **Conclusion and Careful Points**
    *   The analysis consistently shows **2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC**.
    *   **Careful Point 1:** Correctly identify the reaction as an *anti*-dihydroxylation.
    *   **Careful Point 2:** Correctly apply the stereochemical rules: trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso; cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic.
    *   **Careful Point 3:** Understand the fundamental difference in separation capabilities between achiral (separates diastereomers) and chiral (separates diastereomers AND enantiomers) chromatography.
    *   **Careful Point 4:** Match the derived result (2 peaks standard, 3 peaks chiral) to the correct option. A review of the candidate answers shows that many correctly derived this result but then selected the wrong letter. The correct option is C.

    Final Answer: 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.
