def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the physics problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) of an electron.
    This can be calculated using two main principles:
    1. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2
       For minimum uncertainty, Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)
    2. Energy-Momentum Relation: For a particle with velocity v, the uncertainty
       in energy and momentum are related by ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

    Combining these gives: ΔE = v * ħ / (2 * Δx)
