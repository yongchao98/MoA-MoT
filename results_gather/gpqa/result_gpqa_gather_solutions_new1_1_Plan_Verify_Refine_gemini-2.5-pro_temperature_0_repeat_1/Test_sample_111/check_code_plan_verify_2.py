    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the given quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem asks for:
    1. The probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of a given operator A.
    2. The average (expectation) value of that operator A.

    The initial state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.
    The operator A has elements Aij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise.

    The candidate answer to check is A: Probabilities 0.64, 0.36 and average value hbar/7.
