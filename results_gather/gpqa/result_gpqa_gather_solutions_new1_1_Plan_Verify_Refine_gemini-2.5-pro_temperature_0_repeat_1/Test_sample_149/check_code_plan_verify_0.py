    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by logically following the chemical reaction steps.
    1. It deduces the starting material from the provided NMR data and molecular formula.
    2. It traces the starting material through the three reaction steps.
    3. It pays special attention to the conditions of the final step (aldol condensation) to determine if the product is the addition or condensation product.
    4. It compares the derived final product with the LLM's chosen answer.
