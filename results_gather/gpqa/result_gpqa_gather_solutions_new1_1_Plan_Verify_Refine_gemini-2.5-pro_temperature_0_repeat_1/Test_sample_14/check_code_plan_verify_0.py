def check_transit_probability_answer():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the selected answer by recalculating the physics from the ground up.

    The problem asks to compare the transit probabilities of two planets.
    The key formulas are:
    1. Transit Probability (p) for a circular orbit: p ≈ R_s / a
       (R_s = stellar radius, a = semi-major axis)
    2. Kepler's Third Law: P² ∝ a³ / M_s
       (P = orbital period, M_s = stellar mass)

    From these, we can derive the ratio of probabilities.
    """

    # --- Step 1: Define the relationships from the problem statement ---
    # We can use ratios directly without needing absolute values.
    # Ratio of orbital periods (P2 / P1)
    # "orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2" -> P2 = 3 * P1
    ratio_P2_over_P1 = 3.0

    # Ratio of stellar masses (M_s1 / M_s2)
    # "star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2" -> M_s1 = 2 * M_s2
    ratio_Ms1_over_Ms2 = 2.0

    # Ratio of stellar radii (R_s1 / R_s2)
    # "both host stars have the same radii" -> R_s1 = R_s2
    ratio_Rs1_over_Rs2 = 1.0

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the ratio of transit probabilities (p1 / p2) ---
    # The ratio of probabilities is p1/p2 = (R_s1/a1) / (R_s2/a2)
    # This can be rewritten as p1/p2 = (R_s1/R_s2) * (a2/a1)
    # Since R_s1/R_s2 = 1, the probability ratio simplifies to: p1/p2 = a2/a1

    # From Kepler's Law, we can find the ratio a2/a1.
    # a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)
    # So, a2/a1 = [ (M_s2 * P2²) / (M_s1 * P1²) ]^(1/3)
    # This can be rewritten using our defined ratios:
    # a2/a1 = [ (1 / (M_s1/M_s2)) * (P2/P1)² ]^(1/3)

    ratio_a2_over_a1 = ( (1 / ratio_Ms1_over_Ms2) * (ratio_P2_over_P1)**2 )**(1/3)

    # The probability ratio is equal to the semi-major axis ratio
    calculated_probability_ratio = ratio_a2_over_a1

    # --- Step 3: Check the provided answer against the calculation ---
    # The provided final answer is 'B'.
    # Option B states: "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit."

    # Constraint 1: Planet_1 is preferred.
    # This is true if the ratio p1/p2 is greater than 1.

                f"probability ratio p1/p2 is {calculated_probability_ratio:.4f}. "
                f"Since this value is not greater than 1, Planet_2 would be preferred.")

    # Constraint 2: The factor is approximately 1.65.
    # We can use math.isclose() to check if the calculated value is near 1.65.
