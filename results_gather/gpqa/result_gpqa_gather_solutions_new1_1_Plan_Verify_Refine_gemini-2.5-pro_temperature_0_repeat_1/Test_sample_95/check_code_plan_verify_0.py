    1. Correct conversion of units (parsecs to meters, degrees to radians).
    2. Correct application of the small-angle formula to find the diameter (not radius).
    3. Correct calculation of the Schwarzschild radius.
    4. Correct calculation of the event horizon area.
    5. Correct application of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula.
