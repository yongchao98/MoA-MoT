    This function checks the correctness of the final answer by applying the
    most logical model and tie-breaking principle.

    Model: Each character has a value, and the output is the sum.
    Constraints derived from examples:
    1. A + 2*G = 115
    2. C + 2*T = 61
    (Assuming A, C, G, T are positive integers)

    Tie-breaker (Occam's Razor): Find the solution {A, C, G, T} that
    has the minimum possible sum (A + C + G + T).

    The function will find this "simplest" solution and check if it
    produces the target value given in the final answer.
