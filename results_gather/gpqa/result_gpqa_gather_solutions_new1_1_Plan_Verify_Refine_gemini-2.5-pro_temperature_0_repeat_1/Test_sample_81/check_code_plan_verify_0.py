    """
    Checks the correctness of the selected answer for the multi-step synthesis problem.

    The core logic verifies the stereochemical constraints imposed by the reaction sequence:
    1.  The use of maleic anhydride (a cis-dienophile) requires the two ester groups
        (at positions 10 and 11) to be cis to each other.
    2.  A cis relationship for adjacent stereocenters is denoted by (R,S) or (S,R).
    3.  A trans relationship is denoted by (R,R) or (S,S).

    The code parses the IUPAC names to check this constraint for all options and
    evaluates the reasoning of the provided answer.

    # of chemical fact that relies on applying principles of steric hindrance. Since the provided
    # answer's reasoning for this step follows established chemical principles, and the verifiable
    # parts of its logic are correct, the overall answer is deemed correct.
