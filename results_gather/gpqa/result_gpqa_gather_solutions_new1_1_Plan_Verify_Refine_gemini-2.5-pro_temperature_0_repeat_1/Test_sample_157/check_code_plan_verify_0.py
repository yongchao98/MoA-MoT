def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to a molecular biology question.

    The function codifies the logic derived from the question's premises:
    1.  The protein must dimerize to function.
    2.  The mutation is "dominant-negative", meaning it causes a loss-of-function
        phenotype and the mutant protein interferes with the wild-type protein.
    3.  The mutation is in the "dimerization domain", pointing to the mechanism
        of interference.
    4.  A recessive loss-of-function mutation (X) exists, implying the protein
        is haplosufficient (50% of functional protein is enough for a normal phenotype).
