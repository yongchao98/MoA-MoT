            "1. Ethanethiolate (5): Strongest. In a protic solvent, nucleophilicity increases down a group. Sulfur is larger, more polarizable, and less solvated than oxygen, making it the best nucleophile.\n"
            "2. Hydroxide (2): Second. It's an oxygen anion with no resonance and minimal steric hindrance.\n"
            "3. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1): Third. It is also an oxygen anion with no resonance, but it is significantly more sterically hindered than hydroxide, making it less reactive.\n"
            "4. Propionate (3): Fourth. Its negative charge is delocalized by resonance, which stabilizes it and greatly reduces its nucleophilicity.\n"
            "5. Methanol (4): Weakest. It is a neutral molecule and therefore a much poorer nucleophile than any of the anions."
