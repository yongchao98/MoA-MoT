    # --- Given Data ---
    # Planet 1
    m1 = 7.0  # Earth masses
    delta_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstroms

    # Planet 2
    m2 = 5.0  # Earth masses
    delta_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstroms

    # --- Physics Derivation ---
    # The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt(a2 / a1).
    # The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to M_p / sqrt(a).
    # This leads to a ∝ (M_p / K)^2.
    # Since K is proportional to Δλ, we have a ∝ (M_p / Δλ)^2.
    # Therefore, a2 / a1 = (m2 / Δλ2)^2 / (m1 / Δλ1)^2 = (m2/m1)^2 * (Δλ1/Δλ2)^2.
    # So, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt( (m2/m1)^2 * (Δλ1/Δλ2)^2 )
    # T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (m2 / m1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)
