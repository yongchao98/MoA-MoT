Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question
The question asks for the **key factor** that enables the conversion of a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. The context is very specific:
*   **Problem:** Solving higher-dimensional heat equations.
*   **Numerical Method:**
    1.  Higher-order finite difference approximations are used. This turns the partial differential equation (PDE) into a large system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form `dU/dt = AU`.
    2.  The solution involves the matrix exponential function, `exp(AΔt)`.
    3.  This exponential is approximated by a **fractional approximation** (i.e., a rational function `R(z) = P(z)/Q(z)`).
    4.  The algorithm is a **parallel splitting** method.

The core of the question is: What mathematical technique allows the calculation involving `R(AΔt)` to be "split" and run in "parallel"?

### Step 2: Analyze the Computational Process
1.  **Sequential Approach:** The update step is `U_new ≈ R(AΔt)U_old`, which can be written as `Q(AΔt)U_new = P(AΔt)U_old`. This requires solving one very large, complex linear system involving the matrix `Q(AΔt)`. This is inherently sequential and computationally expensive.

2.  **Parallel Approach:** To parallelize this, the single large task must be broken into multiple smaller, **independent** tasks. We need to find the option that describes this decomposition.

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option

*   **A) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation:**
    *   This refers to the mathematical technique of decomposing a rational function `R(z)` into a sum of simpler fractions. For example: `R(z) = P(z)/Q(z) = c₀ + Σ [cᵢ / (z - pᵢ)]`.
    *   When applied to the matrix `AΔt`, the calculation `R(AΔt)U_old` becomes a sum of terms: `c₀U_old + Σ [cᵢ * (AΔt - pᵢI)⁻¹ U_old]`.
    *   Each term `(AΔt - pᵢI)⁻¹ U_old` requires solving a linear system of the form `(AΔt - pᵢI)yᵢ = U_old`.
    *   **Crucially, each of these linear systems is independent of the others.** They can be solved simultaneously on different processors. The final result is then obtained by summing the individual solutions `yᵢ`.
    *   This perfectly matches the description of a "parallel splitting" method. It is the direct mechanism for converting the single large problem into multiple independent ones. This is a very strong candidate.

*   **B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions:**
    *   Nonlocal boundary conditions mean that the value at a point on the boundary depends on values elsewhere in the domain (e.g., an integral over the domain).
    *   This introduces global data dependencies, which makes parallelization *harder*, not easier, as it requires significant communication between processors. This option is an obstacle to, not an enabler of, parallelism.

*   **C) Complex roots of fractional approximation:**
    *   The poles `pᵢ` in the partial fraction expansion can be real or complex. The nature of these roots is a property of the chosen approximation `R(z)`.
    *   While the presence of complex roots means the sub-problems will involve complex arithmetic, it is not the *reason* parallelization is possible. The parallelization comes from the **decomposition into a sum**, which works for both real and complex roots. Therefore, option A is more fundamental.

*   **D) Stability analysis:**
    *   Stability analysis is essential to ensure that the numerical method is valid and that errors do not grow unboundedly. The choice of the fractional approximation `R(z)` is heavily influenced by stability requirements.
    *   However, stability is a prerequisite for a *correct* algorithm, whether it is run sequentially or in parallel. It does not provide the mechanism for *how* to parallelize the algorithm.

### Step 4: Synthesize and Conclude
The overwhelming consensus in the reasoning of the provided candidate answers, and the correct analysis of the numerical method, points to one conclusion: The algebraic technique that underpins this type of parallel algorithm is the decomposition of the rational approximation into a sum of simpler terms via partial fractions. This creates the independent sub-problems necessary for parallel execution.

Therefore, the "Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation" is the key enabling factor.
