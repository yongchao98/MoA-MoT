def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the selected answer for a chemistry question.

    The question asks to identify the starting materials (A and B) for two reactions
    that produce specific diketones using NaNO2, HCl, and H2O.

    The chemical principle is that this set of reagents performs an alpha-oxidation
    on a ketone, converting an adjacent methylene (-CH2-) group into a carbonyl group
    to form a 1,2-diketone. Therefore, both starting materials must be ketones.
