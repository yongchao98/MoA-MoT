def check_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the chemistry question by modeling the chemical logic.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Identify the chiral center and its substituents in the starting material.
    2.  Determine the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of these substituents.
    3.  For each reaction, determine which substituent is chemically transformed.
    4.  Determine the CIP priority of the new set of substituents after the transformation.
    5.  Compare the priority order before and after the reaction. If the relative order of any two groups swaps, the R/S label inverts, even though the 3D configuration is retained.
    6.  Based on this, deduce the required stereochemistry of the starting material to obtain the given product stereochemistry.
    7.  Compare the deduced requirements with the provided answer.
