    # The question asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of f,
    # where f = (1/r^2) * r_hat, over a sphere of radius R.
    # By the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the surface integral of f over the
    # surface of the sphere.
    # ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)

    # As derived in the provided correct answers, the surface integral simplifies to:
    # Integral = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ
