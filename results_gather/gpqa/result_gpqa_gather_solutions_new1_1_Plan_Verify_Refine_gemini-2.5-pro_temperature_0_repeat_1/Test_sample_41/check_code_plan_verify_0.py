def check_exoplanet_period_ratio():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the exoplanet orbital period problem.

    The solution is based on two key physics principles:
    1. The relationship between equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and orbital distance (a) for planets
       orbiting the same star with the same albedo: T_eq ∝ 1/√a. This implies a_y / a_x = (T_x / T_y)².
    2. Kepler's Third Law, which relates orbital period (P) to orbital distance (a): P ∝ a^(3/2).
       This implies P_y / P_x = (a_y / a_x)^(3/2).
