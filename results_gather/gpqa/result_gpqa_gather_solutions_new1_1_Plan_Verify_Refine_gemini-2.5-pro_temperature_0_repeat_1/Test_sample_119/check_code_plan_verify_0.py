    Checks the correctness of the answer to the parallax question using symbolic derivation.

    The question asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/d(plx))
    changes with parallax (plx), assuming a uniform star distribution. The correct
    derivation shows this relationship is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option B.
    This code verifies that derivation.

    # For a uniform density rho, the number of stars dN in a shell of volume dV = 4*pi*d^2*dd
