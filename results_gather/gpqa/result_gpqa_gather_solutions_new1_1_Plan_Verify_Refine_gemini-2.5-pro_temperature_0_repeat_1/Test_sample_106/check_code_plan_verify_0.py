def check_drug_discovery_step(selected_answer: str) -> str:
    """
    Checks the correctness of the selected step for a pre-docking procedure.

    The function evaluates the options based on standard drug discovery principles:
    1. Workflow Order: Steps should be in a logical sequence (e.g., binding before ADME).
    2. Scientific Rigor: Avoid oversimplifications that can lead to false negatives (e.g., only using the most stable form).
    3. Risk Mitigation: The most crucial step is the one that best mitigates the highest risk before committing significant resources. In this case, the risk is spending time on non-binding or irrelevant molecular forms.

This is a crucial part of drug development, but it typically occurs *after* a molecule has shown promising binding affinity to the target (i.e., after a 'hit' is identified). The question asks for the most crucial step *before* docking, which is used to predict that initial binding."

This is a scientifically flawed approach because the biologically active conformation of a molecule is often not its most stable form in isolation. The energy gained from binding to the protein can stabilize a higher-energy isomer or tautomer."
