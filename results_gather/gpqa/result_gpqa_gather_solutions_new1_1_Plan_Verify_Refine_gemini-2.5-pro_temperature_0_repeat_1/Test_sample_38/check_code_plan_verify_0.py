    This function checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer.
    It follows these steps:
    1.  It re-derives the analytical solution for the constant 'a' based on the normalization principle of the wave function.
    2.  It calculates the theoretical numerical value of 'a'.
    3.  It compares this theoretical value to the given options to find the best match.
    4.  It checks if the LLM's final answer and reasoning align with this result.

    # The normalization condition is ∫[from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.
    # The probability density is |ψ(x)|² = (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (-0.5)² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.
    # The integral is ∫[1,3] (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx = [a²*ln(1+x) + 0.25x] from 1 to 3.
    # Evaluating the definite integral:
    # (a²*ln(4) + 0.75) - (a²*ln(2) + 0.25) = a²*(ln(4)-ln(2)) + 0.5 = a²*ln(2) + 0.5.
