def check_astronomy_redshift_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the Lyman-alpha redshift problem.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Define the physical constants: the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line
       and the atmospheric cutoff wavelength for ground-based telescopes.
    2. Identify all possible answers (redshifts) from the options.
    3. For each option, calculate the observed wavelength using the redshift formula.
    4. An option is considered "detectable" if its observed wavelength is longer
       than the atmospheric cutoff.
    5. The question asks for the "lower limit", so the correct answer must be the
       smallest redshift value among all detectable options.
    6. The function checks if the provided answer satisfies this condition.
