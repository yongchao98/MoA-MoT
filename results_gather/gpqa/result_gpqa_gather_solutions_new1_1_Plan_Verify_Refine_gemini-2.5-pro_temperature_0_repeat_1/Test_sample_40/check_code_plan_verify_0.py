    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the physics problem.

    The function verifies the provided answer by:
    1. Defining all candidate formulas (A, B, C, D) as functions.
    2. Testing each formula against two known physical limits:
       - Constraint 1 (Vacuum): If the medium is a vacuum (n=1), the speed of light must be c=1, regardless of the medium's velocity v.
       - Constraint 2 (Stationary Medium): If the medium is stationary (v=0), the speed of light in it must be c/n = 1/n.
    3. Identifying the single formula that satisfies both constraints.
    4. Comparing the identified correct option with the provided answer ('A').
