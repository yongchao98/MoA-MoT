    # We will apply constraints based on the reaction steps to find the correct product.
    
    # Constraint 1: Position of the bromine atom.
    # Step 2 is the bromination of nitrobenzene. The nitro group (-NO2) is a meta-director.
    # Therefore, the bromine atom must be at the 3-position of its phenyl ring.
    # This eliminates any options where bromine is not at position 3 or 3'.
    
    # Constraint 2: Identity of the second substituent.
    # Step 5 involves a reaction with anisole (methoxybenzene).
    # This means the final product must contain a methoxy (-OCH3) group.
    # This eliminates any options with other substituents, like a fluoro group.

    # Constraint 3: Position of the methoxy group.
    # In the Gomberg-Bachmann reaction (Step 5), the methoxy group on anisole is a para-director
    # due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions.
    # Therefore, the methoxy group must be at the 4'-position of its phenyl ring.
