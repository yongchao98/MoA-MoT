    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer based on the physics of the radial velocity method.
    
    The key relationships are:
    1. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the wavelength shift Δλ.
       K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁
    2. For the given conditions (same star mass, same planet mass), K is proportional to T⁻¹/³.
       K₂ / K₁ = (T₂)⁻¹/³ / (T₁)⁻¹/³ = (T₁ / T₂)¹/³
    
    Combining these gives:
    Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = (T₁ / T₂)¹/³
    
    We can then solve for the desired ratio T₂ / T₁.
