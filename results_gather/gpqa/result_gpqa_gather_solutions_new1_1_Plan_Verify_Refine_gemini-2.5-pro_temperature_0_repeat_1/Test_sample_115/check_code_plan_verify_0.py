    # Constraint: Compound C must have two geometrical isomers.
    # Logic:
    # 1. Compound A (from NMR) is n-butane.
    # 2. Monobromination gives B. B can be 1-bromobutane or 2-bromobutane.
    # 3. Elimination from B gives C.
    #    - If B is 1-bromobutane, C is but-1-ene (no geometrical isomers).
    #    - If B is 2-bromobutane, C is but-2-ene (has cis/trans geometrical isomers).
    # Conclusion: The path A(n-butane) -> B(2-bromobutane) -> C(but-2-ene) is correct.
    # This logical step is sound and doesn't require a complex check.

    # --- Verification Step 2: Product Skeleton ---
