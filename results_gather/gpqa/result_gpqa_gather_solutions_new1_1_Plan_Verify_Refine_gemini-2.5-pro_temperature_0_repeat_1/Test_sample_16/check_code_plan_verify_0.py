    """
    This function verifies the calculation for the concentration of calcium ions
    in a Ca-EDTA complex solution.

    The problem involves the dissociation equilibrium:
    [Ca-EDTA]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-

    The equilibrium constant for this dissociation (Kd) is the inverse of the
    given formation constant (Kf).
    Kd = 1 / Kf

    The equilibrium expression is:
    Kd = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [[Ca-EDTA]^2-]

    Using an ICE table, with x = [Ca^2+] at equilibrium:
    Kd = (x * x) / (Initial_Concentration - x)

    Given the large Kf, x is very small, so we can approximate:
    Initial_Concentration - x ≈ Initial_Concentration
    
    This simplifies to:
    Kd ≈ x^2 / Initial_Concentration
    x^2 ≈ Kd * Initial_Concentration
    x ≈ sqrt(Kd * Initial_Concentration)
    x ≈ sqrt((1/Kf) * Initial_Concentration)
