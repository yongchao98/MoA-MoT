    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by performing a symbolic derivation.

    The problem asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr)
    and the distance (r), given that the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/d(plx))
    is proportional to 1/plx^5.

    The key steps for the derivation are:
    1.  Start with the given relationship: dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5. This is the standard physical
        interpretation of the problem statement, treating it as a number density.
    2.  Use the fundamental astronomical relationship between distance and parallax: r = 1/plx,
        which implies plx = 1/r.
    3.  Use the chain rule for transforming densities: dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|.
        The absolute value (Jacobian) is necessary because a number density cannot be negative.
    4.  Calculate the components and combine them to find the final proportionality.
