Here is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.

### Step 1: Analyze the Core Question
The question asks to identify the physical theory, from the given options, that does not require "regularization at high energies." This is a specific technical concept in physics. Regularization is a method used to handle infinite results that appear in calculations, particularly in quantum field theories, when considering interactions at very high energies (or, equivalently, very short distances). A theory that "never requires" this procedure must be inherently free from these types of infinities (known as ultraviolet or UV divergences).

### Step 2: Evaluate the Consensus on Each Theory
I will synthesize the reasoning provided by the various agents for each of the four options.

*   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) & D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** There is a unanimous consensus among all agents that both QCD and QED are quantum field theories that are plagued by ultraviolet (UV) divergences. Calculations in these theories produce infinite results unless the mathematical procedures of regularization and renormalization are applied. Therefore, they both *require* regularization.

*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** There is also a clear consensus that this theory, while not a quantum field theory, has its own divergence problem. The self-energy of a point-like charged particle is calculated to be infinite. This is a high-energy/short-distance problem that requires a form of regularization (e.g., assuming the particle has a finite size) to resolve. Therefore, it also requires a form of regularization.

*   **C) Superstring Theory:** There is an overwhelming and unanimous consensus in the reasoning of all agents that Superstring Theory is fundamentally different. Its core premise is that fundamental particles are not points but extended, one-dimensional strings. This "smearing out" of interactions naturally resolves the short-distance singularities that cause UV divergences in the other theories. All agents who provide reasoning agree that Superstring Theory is believed to be "UV-finite" and thus does not require regularization for high-energy infinities.

### Step 3: Resolve Contradictions and Determine the Correct Answer
The reasoning provided by the agents is remarkably consistent and points to a single correct answer.

*   **The correct theory is Superstring Theory.**

Several agents (1, 3, 10) provided excellent reasoning that correctly identified Superstring Theory as the answer, but then outputted an incorrect final letter (e.g., <<<A>>> or <<<B>>>). These are clear contradictions between their reasoning and their final output, and the reasoning should be trusted over the erroneous final letter. The vast majority of agents (12 out of 15) correctly identified Superstring Theory and provided a consistent final answer.

### Step 4: Map the Correct Theory to the Original Options
Referring back to the original question's list:
A) Quantum Chromodynamics
B) Classical Electrodynamics
**C) Superstring Theory**
D) Quantum Electrodynamics

The correct theory, Superstring Theory, corresponds to option C.
