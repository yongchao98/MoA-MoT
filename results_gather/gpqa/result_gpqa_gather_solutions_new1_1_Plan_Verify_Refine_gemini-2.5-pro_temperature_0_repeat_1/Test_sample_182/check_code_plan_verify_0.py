    # The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

    # Step 2: Analyze the effect of the reaction.
    # The reagent is red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).
    # This is a very powerful reducing agent that performs the following transformations:
    # - Reduces all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (C=C, Câ‰¡C) to single bonds.
    # - Reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids to alkanes.
    # - It does NOT break stable ring structures.
    
    # Step 3: Determine the IHD of the product.
    # The reaction preserves the ring structure but eliminates all pi bonds.
