    # --- Step 1: Determine the correct starting material 'A' ---
    # The product of the first reaction is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, which has a 6-membered ring.
    # The Pinacol rearrangement can involve ring expansion.
    # A starting material with a 5-membered ring (cyclopentane derivative) will expand to a 6-membered ring product.
    # A starting material with a 6-membered ring (cyclohexane derivative) would expand to a 7-membered ring product.
    # Therefore, to get the 6-membered ring product, the starting material must be the cyclopentane derivative.
    correct_A = "1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol"
    reason_A = ("For Reaction A, the product is a cyclohexanone (6-membered ring). "

                "A cyclohexane starting material would have incorrectly formed a cycloheptanone (7-membered ring).")

    # --- Step 2: Determine the correct product 'B' ---
    # The starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.
    # The reaction proceeds via the most stable carbocation. The -OH at C2 leaves to form a tertiary,
    # benzylic carbocation, which is more stable than the secondary carbocation at C3.
    # Next, a 1,2-shift occurs. The groups on the adjacent carbon (C3) are Hydrogen (H) and Methyl (CH3).
    # The migratory aptitude is H > CH3.
    # Therefore, a 1,2-hydride shift occurs, leading to a ketone at the C3 position.
    correct_B = "methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate"
    reason_B = ("For Reaction B, the mechanism involves forming the most stable carbocation (at C2), "
                "followed by a 1,2-shift of the group with the highest migratory aptitude from C3. "
                "Hydride (H) has a higher migratory aptitude than methyl (CH3). "
                "This hydride shift leads to the formation of methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.")
