    # 1. Identify Compound A using Hint (a)
    # Hint (a): Wittig reaction of A gives 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
    # Retro-Wittig analysis: Replace the C=C(CH3)2 group with a C=O group.
    # The name "1,2-dimethyl-4-(...)" implies the carbonyl is at position 4 relative to methyls at 1 and 2.
    # Renaming according to IUPAC rules (C=O is position 1) gives 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one.

    # A (ketone) -> B (cyanohydrin) -> C (1-aminomethyl-cycloalkanol) -> D (diazonium salt) -> E (ring-expanded ketone)
    # This sequence is a Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement, which causes a one-carbon ring expansion.
    # A (5-membered ring) -> E (6-membered ring)
    
    # 4. Deduce the structure of Compound E
    # The starting ring is a cyclopentanone. The product E must be a cyclohexanone.
    # The substituents (3,4-dimethyl) are carried over to the new ring.
