    # --- Step 1: Evaluate each option based on the data ---

    # Option A: "qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples"
    # This is a general knowledge check. The statement is false as qPCR is a standard method for quantification.
    # This check doesn't require data analysis.

    # Option B: "Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles"
    concentrations = sorted(data.keys(), reverse=True)
    avg_cts = [np.mean(data[c]) for c in concentrations]
    delta_cts = [avg_cts[i] - avg_cts[i+1] for i in range(len(avg_cts) - 1)]
    is_B_true = any(d > 3.3 for d in delta_cts)
    # The calculated differences are all exactly 3.3, so this statement is false.

    # Option C: "Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples"
    # This implies the fundamental inverse relationship (higher concentration -> lower Ct) is violated.
    # Let's check if Ct values decrease as concentration decreases.
    is_C_true = all(avg_cts[i] > avg_cts[i+1] for i in range(len(avg_cts) - 1))
    # The data shows that as concentration decreases, Ct also decreases. This violates the principle.
    # Therefore, the statement that they are "not in agreement" is true.

    # Option D: "The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates"
    deviations = [max(cts) - min(cts) for cts in data.values()]
    is_D_true = any(d > 0.3 for d in deviations)
    # The calculated deviations are all 0.6, which is > 0.3. So, this statement is true.

    # --- Step 2: Determine the best answer and check against the LLM's choice ---

    if not is_C_true:
        return "Incorrect. The provided answer is 'C', but the code analysis shows that the Ct values are, in fact, in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid, which contradicts the premise of the answer."
