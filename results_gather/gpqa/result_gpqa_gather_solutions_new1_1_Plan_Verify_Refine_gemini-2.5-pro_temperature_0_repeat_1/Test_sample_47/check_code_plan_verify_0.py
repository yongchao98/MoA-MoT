    # Step 1: Verify the reaction pathway to identify the final product.
    # The consensus among the provided answers is that the reaction sequence is:
    # 1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 -> 2-bromocyclohexanone (alpha-bromination)
    # 2. 2-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH -> cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Favorskii rearrangement)
    # 3. cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl2 -> cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (acid chloride formation)
    # 4. cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + LiAlH(OtBu)3 -> cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (mild reduction)
    # This pathway is chemically sound and consistent with the reagents provided.
    final_product_name = "cyclopentanecarbaldehyde"

    # Step 2: Analyze the structure of the final product to count chemically distinct hydrogens.
    # The number of distinct hydrogens is determined by the molecule's symmetry.
    # Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry passing through the aldehyde group and C1 of the ring.

    # Count the unique hydrogen environments:
    # Type 1: The aldehyde proton (-CHO). It is in a unique environment.
    aldehyde_protons = 1
    
    # Type 2: The proton on C1 (the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde). It is also unique.
    c1_protons = 1
    
    # Type 3 & 4: The protons on C2 and C5. These carbons are equivalent by symmetry.
    # However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (not equivalent).
    # This results in two distinct types of protons for these four hydrogens.
    c2_c5_proton_types = 2
    
    # Type 5 & 6: The protons on C3 and C4. These carbons are also equivalent by symmetry.
    # The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic.
    # This results in another two distinct types of protons.
    c3_c4_proton_types = 2
    
    # Calculate the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen types.
    calculated_distinct_hydrogens = aldehyde_protons + c1_protons + c2_c5_proton_types + c3_c4_proton_types
    
    # Step 3: Compare the calculated result with the provided answer.
    # The question's options are: A) 7, B) 10, C) 6, D) 8
    # The final consensus answer provided is <<<C>>>.
