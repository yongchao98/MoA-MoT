    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for a Pinacol rearrangement question.
    It does this by applying the two key principles of the reaction:
    1. Formation of the most stable carbocation.
    2. Migration of the group with the highest migratory aptitude.
    
    The function then compares its predicted products to the products given in the proposed answer (Option C).

    # --- Reaction A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol ---
    # Structure: CH3CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-C(OH)(Ph)-CH2CH3
    # Step 1: Carbocation stability. A carbocation at C4 is tertiary and benzylic (stabilized by the phenyl ring),
    # making it significantly more stable than the simple tertiary carbocation at C3.
    # Step 2: Migration. With the carbocation at C4, a group from C3 must migrate. The groups are 'ethyl' and 'methyl'.
    # The ethyl group has a higher migratory aptitude than the methyl group.
    # Predicted Product A: The migration of the ethyl group leads to 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

    # --- Reaction B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol ---
    # Structure: CH3-C(OH)(Ph)-C(OH)(p-OH-Ph)-CH2CH3
    # Step 1: Carbocation stability. A carbocation at C3 is stabilized by a p-hydroxyphenyl group (a strong electron-donating group),
    # making it more stable than the carbocation at C2, which is stabilized by a simple phenyl group.
    # Step 2: Migration. With the carbocation at C3, a group from C2 must migrate. The groups are 'phenyl' and 'methyl'.
    # The phenyl group has a much higher migratory aptitude than the methyl group.
    # Predicted Product B: The migration of the phenyl group leads to 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

    # --- Reaction C: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol ---
    # Structure: (An)2C(OH)-C(OH)(An)(Ph), where An = p-methoxyphenyl
    # Step 1: Carbocation stability. A carbocation at C1 is stabilized by two powerful electron-donating p-methoxyphenyl groups,
    # making it more stable than the carbocation at C2, which is stabilized by only one such group and a phenyl group.
    # Step 2: Migration. With the carbocation at C1, a group from C2 must migrate. The groups are 'p-methoxyphenyl' and 'phenyl'.
    # The p-methoxyphenyl group has a higher migratory aptitude due to its electron-donating nature.
    # Predicted Product C: The migration of the p-methoxyphenyl group leads to 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one.
