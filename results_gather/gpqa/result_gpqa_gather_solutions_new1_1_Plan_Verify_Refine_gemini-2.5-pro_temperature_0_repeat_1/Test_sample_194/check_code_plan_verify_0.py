    # The relationship between two planets in the same system is derived from:
    # 1. Impact parameter: b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s
    # 2. Kepler's Third Law: (P2/P1)^2 = (a2/a1)^3
    # Since inclination 'i' and stellar radius 'R_s' are constant, we get a2/a1 = b2/b1.
    # Combining these gives: P2 = P1 * (b2/b1)^(3/2)

    # --- Model 1: Simplified Transit Condition ---
    # This model assumes the maximum period occurs when the planet's *center* grazes the star's limb.
    # This is a common simplification and corresponds to a maximum impact parameter b2_max = 1.
