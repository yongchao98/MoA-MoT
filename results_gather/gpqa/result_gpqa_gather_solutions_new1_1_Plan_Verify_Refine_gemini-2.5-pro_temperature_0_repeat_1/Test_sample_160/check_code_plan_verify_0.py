    - λ1: Mean free path (MFP) of a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule.
    - λ2: MFP of a high-energy electron scattering off a gas molecule.

    # --- Step 1: Define the physical constraints and relationships ---

    # Constraint 1: The formula for MFP of a gas molecule in a gas of its own kind
    # includes a sqrt(2) factor to account for the relative motion of all particles.
    # λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)

    # Constraint 2: The formula for MFP of a very high-speed particle (electron)
    # moving through relatively stationary targets (gas molecules) does not have the sqrt(2) factor.
    # λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)
    # where σ_eg = electron-gas scattering cross-section.

    # Constraint 3: The relationship between the cross-sections.
    # For very high-energy electrons (1000 kV = 1 MeV), the interaction time is short,
    # and the atom is relatively "transparent". The scattering cross-section (σ_eg)
    # is significantly SMALLER than the physical kinetic cross-section (σ_gg).
    # Therefore, the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a number greater than 1.
    sigma_gg_is_greater_than_sigma_eg = True

    # --- Step 2: Derive the mathematical relationship between λ2 and λ1 ---

    # The ratio of the two mean free paths is:
    # λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]
    # λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)
    # λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)

    # Based on the constraints, we can determine the lower bound for the ratio λ2 / λ1.
    # Since (σ_gg / σ_eg) > 1, the ratio (λ2 / λ1) must be greater than sqrt(2).
    min_ratio_lambda2_to_lambda1 = math.sqrt(2)  # Approximately 1.414

    # --- Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the derived relationship ---

    # The derived conclusion is that λ2 / λ1 > 1.414.
    # Let's check which option is consistent with this conclusion.
    # A) λ2 = λ1  --> ratio = 1. (Inconsistent)
    # B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 --> 1 < ratio < 1.22. (Inconsistent)
    # C) λ2 < λ1 --> ratio < 1. (Inconsistent)
    # D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 --> ratio >= 1.22. (Consistent, since 1.414 is >= 1.22)
