    Checks the correctness of the answer for the given organic chemistry question.
    The reaction is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with HBr.
    The correct mechanism is an intramolecular electrophilic substitution (cyclization)
    which is an isomerization reaction. This leads to two cyclic ether products.
