def check_exoplanet_density_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the exoplanet density question.

    The core principle is gravitational compression: for planets of the same
    composition, density increases with mass. We can model this with a
    simplified mass-radius relationship where R ∝ M^k, with k < 1/3.
    This implies that density ρ ∝ M^(1-3k). A common value for k is ~0.27,
    making ρ ∝ M^0.19. We will use this model to calculate relative densities.
