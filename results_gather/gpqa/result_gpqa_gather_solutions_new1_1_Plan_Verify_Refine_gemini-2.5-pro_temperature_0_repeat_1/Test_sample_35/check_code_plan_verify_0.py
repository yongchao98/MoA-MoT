def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the astrophysics question.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Calculates the cosmological redshift (z) for the given distance.
    2. Calculates the rest-frame energy of the observed absorption line.
    3. Identifies the transition by comparing the rest-frame energy to the known
       energy of the 21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen.
    4. Applies the physical principle that 21-cm absorption traces the cold
       atomic interstellar medium to determine the correct option.
    5. Compares the derived correct option with the provided answer.
