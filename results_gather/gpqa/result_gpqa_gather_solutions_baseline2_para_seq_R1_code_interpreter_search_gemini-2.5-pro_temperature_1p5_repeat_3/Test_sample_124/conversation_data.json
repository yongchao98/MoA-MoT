We need to find how many different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ add up to $n=3$.\n    We can enumerate the possibilities:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — **3 states**\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n        (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — **6 states**\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        (1, 1, 1) — **1 state**\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, one can use the general formula for the degeneracy of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\n5.  **Match with the Options:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n    B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n    C) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n    D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n\n    Option D correctly matches both the energy and the degeneracy. The energy expressions in options A and B are for a particle in a spherical box, not a harmonic oscillator.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is a system described by the potential $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates, meaning the total energy is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators.\n\n1.  **Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The energy of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator in the state $n_i$ is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n    For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies from the three dimensions (x, y, z):\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_n = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    Let the principal quantum number for the 3D oscillator be $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n2.  **Identifying the Energy States:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which is for $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This is for $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This is for $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This is for $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n3.  **Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\n    We can list the combinations for $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) -> 3 states\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n        (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) -> 6 states\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        (1, 1, 1) -> 1 state\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, the degeneracy of the n-th level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, n = 3:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy (degeneracy) is 10. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2r^2$.\n\n**1. Energy of the 3D Isotropic Harmonic Oscillator**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\nwhere:\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n*   $n$ is the principal quantum number, which can be any non-negative integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$).\n\n**2. Identifying the Third Excited State**\n\nThe energy levels are determined by the quantum number $n$:\n*   **Ground State:** $n = 0$\n*   **First Excited State:** $n = 1$\n*   **Second Excited State:** $n = 2$\n*   **Third Excited State:** $n = 3$\n\n**3. Calculating the Energy of the Third Excited State**\n\nWe substitute $n=3$ into the energy formula:\n$E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\left(\\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n**4. Degeneracy of the Energy Level**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of distinct quantum states (eigenfunctions) that have this energy. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the principal quantum number $n$ is related to the Cartesian quantum numbers by $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. The degeneracy $g_n$ is the number of ways to choose these three integers to sum to $n$.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy of the $n$-th level is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\n**5. Calculating the Degeneracy for the Third Excited State**\n\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$. We substitute this value into the degeneracy formula:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$\n\nThis means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**6. Matching with the Options**\n\n*   Energy value: $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   Number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy): 10\n\nThis corresponds exactly to option C. Let's check the other options:\n*   A) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$: The energy expression is incorrect. It resembles the energy for a particle in a spherical cavity, not a harmonic oscillator.\n*   B) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$: The degeneracy is incorrect.\n*   D) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$: Both the energy expression and the degeneracy are incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct option is C. The provided code output correctly computes these values, confirming our analytical solution.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
