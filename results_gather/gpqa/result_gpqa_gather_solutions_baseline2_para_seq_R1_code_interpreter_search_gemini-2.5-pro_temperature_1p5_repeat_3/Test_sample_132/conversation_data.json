Identify the chemical species and their initial amounts.**\n*   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n*   In water, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   In water, Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H2O.\n*   The key species for the buffer are the conjugate acid-base pair: H2PO4- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base).\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of the acid and conjugate base.**\n*   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Therefore, moles of H2PO4- = 0.007348 mol\n*   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Therefore, moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005618 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the initial concentrations of the acid and conjugate base.**\n*   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm3 = 200.00 mL = 0.2000 L\n*   Initial concentration of H2PO4- ([H2PO4-]_initial) = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.2000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- ([HPO4^2-]_initial) = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.2000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**4. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\nThe pH of the buffer is governed by the equilibrium involving H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n*   Equilibrium reaction: H2PO4- (aq) ⇌ H+ (aq) + HPO4^2- (aq)\n*   The equilibrium constant is Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8.\n*   The expression for Ka2 is: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]. Since this is a buffer solution, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations of the acid and base with their initial concentrations.\n*   [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n*   [H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H+] ≈ 8.110 x 10^-8 M\n\n**5.

We use the [H+] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-], as the amount that dissociates is negligible due to the very small Ka3 value.\n*   [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n*   [PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.110 x 10^-8 M)\n*   [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\nRounding this value to three significant figures gives 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Identify the components and their roles:**\n*   The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolved in water.\n*   KH2PO4 provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-), which acts as a weak acid.\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-), which is the conjugate base of H2PO4-.\n*   Together, H2PO4- and HPO4^2- form a buffer solution. The pH of this buffer is determined by the equilibrium involving these two species.\n\n**2.

The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is determined by the third equilibrium, governed by Ka3.\n\n**3. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\n*   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n*   Moles of H2PO4- = Mass of KH2PO4 / Molar mass of KH2PO4\n    Moles H2PO4- = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Concentration of H2PO4- = [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   Moles of HPO4^2- = Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O / Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O\n    Moles HPO4^2- = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n*   Concentration of HPO4^2- = [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**4.

We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but it's more direct to solve for $[H^+]$ here since we need it for the next step.\n    *   $[H^+] = K_{a2} \\times \\frac{[H_2PO_4^-]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n    *   Using the initial concentrations (as the change is negligible in a buffer):\n        $[H^+] = (6.2 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times \\frac{0.03674}{0.02809} \\approx 8.114 \\times 10^{-8} \\ M$\n\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion ($PO_4^{3-}$):**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation step:\n        $HPO_4^{2-}(aq) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + PO_4^{3-}(aq)$\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this equilibrium is $K_{a3} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12}$.\n    *   The expression for $K_{a3}$ is: $K_{a3} = \\frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n    *   We want to find $[PO_4^{3-}]$, so we rearrange the equation:\n        $[PO_4^{3-}] = K_{a3} \\times \\frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]}$\n    *   Now, we plug in the values we have:\n        *   $K_{a3} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12}$\n        *   $[HPO_4^{2-}] \\approx [HPO_4^{2-}]_{initial} = 0.02809 \\ M$ (the amount that dissociates into $PO_4^{3-}$ is extremely small because $K_{a3}$ is so small).\n        *   $[H^+] \\approx 8.114 \\times 10^{-8} \\ M$ (from the buffer calculation in step 3).\n    *   $[PO_4^{3-}] = (1.8 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times \\frac{0.02809}{8.114 \\times 10^{-8}}$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   This calculation was performed accurately by the Python code.\n    *   The code calculated the concentrations and then the final $[PO_4^{3-}]$ value without intermediate rounding.\n    *   Code Output: `6.24e-07`\n    *   This means the concentration of orthophosphate ions, $[PO_4^{3-}]$, is $6.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n6.  **Match with options:**\n    *   The calculated value, $6.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires calculating the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) in a buffer solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n\nThe solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O). These salts dissociate in water to produce the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻) and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), respectively.\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    *   Volume = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n    *   Concentration = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    *   Concentration = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 2: Determine the pH and [H⁺] of the buffer solution.**\n\nThe solution contains a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This pair forms a buffer. The equilibrium that governs this buffer system is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻, with Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n*   pKa₂ = -log(Ka₂) = -log(6.2 x 10⁻⁸) = 7.21\n*   pH = pKa₂ + log ([Base] / [Acid])\n*   pH = 7.21 + log ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻])\n*   pH = 7.21 + log (0.02809 M / 0.03674 M) = 7.21 + log(0.7646) = 7.21 - 0.117 = 7.093\n\nNow, calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:\n*   [H⁺] = 10⁻pH = 10⁻⁷.⁰⁹³ ≈ 8.07 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻).**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed by the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This is the third dissociation step for phosphoric acid:\n\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻, with Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n\nThe equilibrium expression for this reaction is:\nKa₃ = ([H⁺][PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n\nWe can now plug in the values we have calculated. We assume the equilibrium concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] is equal to its initial concentration (0.02809 M) because the value of Ka₃ is extremely small, meaning very little of it will dissociate.\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.07 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n*   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.26 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value of 6.26 x 10⁻⁷ M is closest to option B. The small difference is due to rounding during the intermediate steps. The code execution, which used higher precision, gave a result of 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M, which rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning behind the calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance.**\n    The problem provides the mass of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) and their respective molar masses. We can calculate the number of moles of each.\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Determine the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    When these salts dissolve in water, they dissociate completely.\n    *   KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ + 2H₂O\n    The key species for the buffer are the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻) and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). Their initial concentrations are calculated using the total volume of the solution (200.00 cm³ = 0.2000 L).\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.2000 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.2000 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Identify the relevant equilibria.**\n    Phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps:\n    *   H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻       (Ka₁ = 7.5x10⁻³)\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻       (Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸)\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻         (Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²)\n\n    The solution contains a mixture of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. This forms a buffer system governed by the second equilibrium (Ka₂). We need to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻), which is a product of the third equilibrium (Ka₃).\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺].**\n    We use the Ka₂ expression to find the [H⁺] of the buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation could also be used to find the pH first, but working directly with Ka₂ is more direct for finding [H⁺].\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.113 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration.**\n    Now we use the Ka₃ expression and the calculated [H⁺] to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻]. We can assume the concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] is its initial value because the dissociation is very small (due to the very small Ka₃).\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]: [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.113 x 10⁻⁸ M) ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python script confirms this result:\n`conc_PO4_3minus` = 6.24e-07 M\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning behind the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Components and Reactions:**\n    *   We have a solution containing potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   In water, these salts dissociate completely:\n        *   KH2PO4(s) → K+(aq) + H2PO4-(aq)\n        *   Na2HPO4●2H2O(s) → 2 Na+(aq) + HPO4^2-(aq) + 2 H2O(l)\n    *   The key species are the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-) and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). These form a buffer pair corresponding to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations:**\n    *   First, we need to find the molar concentration of each component in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 (and thus H2PO4-) = mass / Molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles.\n    *   Initial concentration of H2PO4- = [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 moles / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O (and thus HPO4^2-) = mass / Molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles.\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- = [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 moles / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+] of the Buffer:**\n    *   The pH of the buffer is determined by the equilibrium involving the buffer pair (H2PO4- and HPO4^2-).

Let's re-evaluate the problem step-by-step to arrive at the correct solution confirmed by the code execution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components:** The solution contains:\n    *   KH₂PO₄, which dissociates into K⁺ and the dihydrogen phosphate ion, H₂PO₄⁻. H₂PO₄⁻ acts as a weak acid.\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O, which dissociates into 2Na⁺ and the hydrogen phosphate ion, HPO₄²⁻ (the dihydrate part just becomes part of the solvent). HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base of H₂PO₄⁻.\n\n3.  **Calculate Moles and Initial Concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L.\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = Mass of KH₂PO₄ / Molar Mass of KH₂PO₄\n        Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = Mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O / Molar Mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O\n        Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n4.  **Analyze the Buffer System:** The solution contains a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻), forming a buffer. The pH of this buffer is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), which has the acid dissociation constant Ka₂.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻] = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n\n5.  **Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:** We can rearrange the Ka₂ expression to solve for [H⁺].\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (1.3079)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n6.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:** The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed by the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, which is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻] = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n\n7.  **Solve for [PO₄³⁻]:** Rearrange the Ka₃ expression to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion. We use the [H⁺] we just calculated from the buffer and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻], as its dissociation is negligible.\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Final Answer:** The calculated concentration is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to the output provided by the code execution (`6.24e-07`).

There appears to have been an error in the initial reasoning. Let's re-evaluate the problem step-by-step to arrive at the correct solution confirmed by the code execution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components:** The solution contains:\n    *   KH₂PO₄, which dissociates into K⁺ and the dihydrogen phosphate ion, H₂PO₄⁻. H₂PO₄⁻ acts as a weak acid.\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O, which dissociates into 2Na⁺ and the hydrogen phosphate ion, HPO₄²⁻ (the dihydrate part just becomes part of the solvent). HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base of H₂PO₄⁻.\n\n3.  **Calculate Moles and Initial Concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L.\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = Mass of KH₂PO₄ / Molar Mass of KH₂PO₄\n        Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = Mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O / Molar Mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O\n        Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n4.  **Analyze the Buffer System:** The solution contains a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻), forming a buffer. The pH of this buffer is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), which has the acid dissociation constant Ka₂.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻] = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n\n5.  **Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:** We can rearrange the Ka₂ expression to solve for [H⁺].\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (1.3079)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n6.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:** The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed by the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, which is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻] = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n\n7.  **Solve for [PO₄³⁻]:** Rearrange the Ka₃ expression to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion. We use the [H⁺] we just calculated from the buffer and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻], as its dissociation is negligible.\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Final Answer:** The calculated concentration is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to the output provided by the code execution (`6.24e-07`). This matches option D.\n\nThe corrected calculation confirms that the code's output was accurate and the final answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
