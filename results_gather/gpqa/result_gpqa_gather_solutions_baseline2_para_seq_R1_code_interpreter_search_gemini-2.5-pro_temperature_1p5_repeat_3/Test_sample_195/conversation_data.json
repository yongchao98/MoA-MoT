Identify the relevant physical principles:**\nThe problem involves a relativistic object moving under the influence of a conservative force (from a spring, obeying Hooke's Law). The key principle to use is the conservation of energy. In special relativity, the total energy of a particle must be considered.\n\n**2. Define the energy components:**\n*   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):** For a particle of rest mass `m` moving at speed `v`, the kinetic energy is given by `K = (γ - 1)mc²`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ` is the Lorentz factor and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   **Potential Energy (U):** The force is given by Hooke's Law, `F = -kx`. The potential energy `U(x)` is the negative integral of the force with respect to position:\n    `U(x) = -∫ F dx = -∫ (-kx) dx = (1/2)kx²`. We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position (`x=0`).\n\n**3. Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\nIn a conservative system, the total mechanical energy `E_mech` is conserved. The total mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy.\n`E_mech = K + U = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx² = constant`\n\n**4. Analyze the system at two key points:**\nWe need to evaluate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillator's motion:\n*   **Point 1: At maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction. Therefore, its speed is zero (`v = 0`).\n    When `v = 0`, the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0²/c²) = 1`.\n    The kinetic energy `K = (1 - 1)mc² = 0`.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: `U(A) = (1/2)kA²`.\n    The total energy at this point is `E_mech = 0 + (1/2)kA² = (1/2)kA²`.\n\n*   **Point 2: At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    As the mass passes through the equilibrium position, its potential energy is zero, and its speed is at its maximum (`v = v_max`).\n    The kinetic energy is `K = (γ_max - 1)mc²`, where `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`.\n    The potential energy is `U(0) = (1/2)k(0)² = 0`.\n    The total energy at this point is `E_mech = (γ_max - 1)mc² + 0 = (γ_max - 1)mc²`.\n\n**5. Equate the energies and solve for v_max:**\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy at Point 1 must equal the total energy at Point 2.\n`(γ_max - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA²`\n\nNow, we solve this equation for `v_max`. First, isolate `γ_max`:\n`γ_max - 1 = (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n`γ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\nNext, substitute the definition of `γ_max`:\n`1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for `v_max`. Let's invert both sides:\n`sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))`\n\nSquare both sides:\n`1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n\nIsolate the `v_max²/c²` term:\n`v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n\nFinally, multiply by `c²` and take the square root to find `v_max`:\n`v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²)`\n\n**6. Compare with the given options:**\nThe derived expression for `v_max` is:\n`v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}`\n\nThis matches option D exactly.\n\n**Alternative approach using total relativistic energy:**\nOne can also define the total conserved energy as `E_total = γmc² + U(x)`.\n*   At `x=A`, `v=0`, `γ=1`: `E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA²`.\n*   At `x=0`, `v=v_max`, `U=0`: `E_total = γ_max mc²`.\nEquating these gives `γ_max mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²`, which simplifies to `(γ_max - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA²`, the same equation as before, yielding the same result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In a conservative system like a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is constant. We need to find the correct expression for energy in a relativistic context.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy of the relativistic system.**\n    The total energy (Hamiltonian) of a relativistic particle of rest mass $m$ and speed $v$ moving in a potential $U(x)$ is given by:\n    $E = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $mc^2$ is the rest energy.\n    *   $\\gamma mc^2$ is the total relativistic energy of the free particle.\n    *   $U(x)$ is the potential energy.\n\n    For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    So, the conserved total energy of the system is:\n    $E = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy at two key points of the motion.**\n    The total energy $E$ must be the same at every point in the particle's trajectory. We will evaluate $E$ at the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude) and at the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **At the maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n        The particle momentarily stops, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        At this point, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy is:\n        $E = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n        The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        The speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is at its maximum: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy is:\n        $E = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the expressions for total energy.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum amplitude is equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $E(\\text{at } x=A) = E(\\text{at } x=0)$\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.**\n    First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing the equation by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    This exactly matches option (C).\n\n*Alternative Check (using Relativistic Work-Energy Theorem):*\nThe work done by the spring force as the mass moves from the amplitude (x=A) to the center (x=0) is equal to the change in its relativistic kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\nWork $W = \\int_A^0 F dx = \\int_A^0 (-kx) dx = -k[\\frac{x^2}{2}]_A^0 = -k(0 - \\frac{A^2}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\nChange in kinetic energy $\\Delta K = K_{final} - K_{initial} = K(\\text{at } x=0) - K(\\text{at } x=A)$.\n$K(\\text{at } x=0) = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n$K(\\text{at } x=A) = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\nSo, $\\Delta K = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\nEquating work and change in kinetic energy:\n$\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n$\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$.\nThis is the same equation obtained from the conservation of energy, and it leads to the same final answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed $v_{max}$ of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy of the system is conserved. The system consists of the oscillating mass and the spring (or the potential field it creates). The total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy stored in the spring.\n\n2.  **Write down the expressions for the energy components.**\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving with speed $v$ is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.

A consistent formulation for the conserved total energy of a particle in a potential field is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light. This energy includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n    *   The potential energy of a mass attached to a spring obeying Hooke's Law ($F = -kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where we set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n3.  **Total Conserved Energy:** The total conserved energy ($E_{total}$) of the system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    This quantity remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n4.  **Analyze Two Key Points in the Oscillation:** We can find the value of this constant total energy by analyzing the system at a point where we know all the variables. Then we can use this value to solve for the unknown variable at another point. The two most convenient points are the position of maximum displacement (the amplitude) and the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **At maximum displacement (amplitude):**\n        *   Position: $x = A$\n        *   The mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (center of oscillation):**\n        *   Position: $x = 0$\n        *   The potential energy is minimum ($U(0) = 0$), so the kinetic energy (and thus speed) must be maximum. Let's call this maximum speed $v_{max}$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor at this point is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n5.  **Equate Energies and Solve for v_max:**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum displacement must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n    *   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n    *   Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   To solve for $v_{max}$, let's first isolate the square root term by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        $1-\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option D exactly.\n\n    *   A) is incorrect.\n    *   B) is incorrect.\n    *   C) corresponds to the non-relativistic case, which can be obtained from our result in the limit $c \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\to 0$, and using the binomial approximation $(1+x)^{-2} \\approx 1-2x$ for small $x$, we get $v_{max}^2 \\approx c^2(1-(1-2\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})) = c^2(\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}) = \\frac{kA^2}{m}$, so $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$. This confirms our relativistic formula has the correct non-relativistic limit.\n    *   D) is the correct relativistic result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is the step-by-step derivation for the maximum speed of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Define the system and conserved quantity.**\n    The system consists of a mass $m$ attached to a spring with spring constant $k$. The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. This force is conservative, and the corresponding potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    In a relativistic system, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energy of the mass and the potential energy. Since there are no non-conservative forces, the total energy is conserved.\n    The total energy $E_{total}$ at any point $x$ with velocity $v$ is given by:\n    $E_{total} = E_{relativistic} + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Analyze the energy at the point of maximum amplitude.**\n    The maximum amplitude is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, denoted by $x = A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops before reversing its direction. Therefore, its velocity is zero ($v=0$).\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    Since total energy is conserved, this is the total energy of the oscillator throughout its motion.\n\n3.  **Analyze the energy at the equilibrium position.**\n    The equilibrium position is at $x=0$. At this point, the potential energy is zero ($U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$).\n    The restoring force is also zero at this point, which means the acceleration is zero. This is where the mass achieves its maximum speed, $v_{max}$.\n    The total energy at the equilibrium position is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n    where $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n4.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    Equate the total energy at the maximum amplitude ($x=A$) with the total energy at the equilibrium position ($x=0$):\n    Energy at $x=A$ = Energy at $x=0$\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.**\n    First, solve the energy equation for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to relate it to $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ we found:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we can first solve for the term $(1 - v_{max}^2/c^2)$:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$ by multiplying by $c^2$ and taking the square root:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The derived expression matches option C.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (Classical limit, incorrect)\n    *   B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ (Incorrect form)\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ (Correct)\n    *   D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ (Incorrect form and dimensions)\n\nThe correct expression for the maximum speed of the mass is given by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    For an isolated system, the total energy is conserved.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided answers.\n\n**1. Core Physical Principle: Conservation of Energy**\nThe problem involves a conservative force ($F=-kx$, from Hooke's Law), which means the total energy of the system is conserved throughout the oscillation. The system's energy needs to be described using the framework of special relativity.\n\n**2. Forms of Energy in a Relativistic System**\nThere are two equivalent ways to formulate the total energy of the system:\n*   **Method A (Kinetic + Potential):** The total mechanical energy ($E_{mech}$) is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy ($K$) and the potential energy ($U$).\n    *   $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$\n    *   $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    *   $E_{mech} = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant}$\n*   **Method B (Total Relativistic + Potential):** The total energy of the system ($E_{total}$) is the sum of the particle's total relativistic energy ($E_{particle}$) and the potential energy ($U$). This approach is more fundamental.\n    *   $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$ (This includes the rest mass energy)\n    *   $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    *   $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant}$\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, as subtracting the constant rest energy $mc^2$ from Method B gives Method A. Nearly all candidate answers correctly identify and use one of these two forms of energy conservation.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy**\nWe apply the conservation law by equating the total energy at two key points:\n*   **Point 1: Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**\n    *   At this point, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v=0$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy of the system is $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n*   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**\n    *   At this point, the potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n    *   The speed is at its maximum value, $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is also at its maximum value: $\\gamma_{max} = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$.\n    *   The total energy of the system is $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n**4. Solving for v_max**\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy at both points is the same:\n$E_{total}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\n1.  Isolate $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n\n2.  Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n3.  Algebraically solve for $v_{max}$:\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the terms:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe derived expression for the maximum speed is $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$. This exactly matches option A.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while their physical reasoning was overwhelmingly correct and led to the same formula, there were frequent errors in matching this final formula to the correct option letter.

Define the energy components:**\n*   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):** For a particle of rest mass `m` moving at speed `v`, the kinetic energy is given by `K = (γ - 1)mc²`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ` is the Lorentz factor and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   **Potential Energy (U):** The force is given by Hooke's Law, `F = -kx`. The potential energy `U(x)` is the negative integral of the force with respect to position:\n    `U(x) = -∫ F dx = -∫ (-kx) dx = (1/2)kx²`. We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position (`x=0`).\n\n**3. Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\nIn a conservative system, the total mechanical energy `E_mech` is conserved. The total mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy.\n`E_mech = K + U = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx² = constant`\n\n**4. Analyze the system at two key points:**\nWe need to evaluate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillator's motion:\n*   **Point 1: At maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction. Therefore, its speed is zero (`v = 0`).\n    When `v = 0`, the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0²/c²) = 1`.\n    The kinetic energy `K = (1 - 1)mc² = 0`.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: `U(A) = (1/2)kA²`.\n    The total energy at this point is `E_mech = 0 + (1/2)kA² = (1/2)kA²`.\n\n*   **Point 2: At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    As the mass passes through the equilibrium position, its potential energy is zero, and its speed is at its maximum (`v = v_max`).\n    The kinetic energy is `K = (γ_max - 1)mc²`, where `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`.\n    The potential energy is `U(0) = (1/2)k(0)² = 0`.\n    The total energy at this point is `E_mech = (γ_max - 1)mc² + 0 = (γ_max - 1)mc²`.\n\n**5. Equate the energies and solve for v_max:**\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy at Point 1 must equal the total energy at Point 2.\n`(γ_max - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA²`\n\nNow, we solve this equation for `v_max`. First, isolate `γ_max`:\n`γ_max - 1 = (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n`γ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\nNext, substitute the definition of `γ_max`:\n`1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for `v_max`. Let's invert both sides:\n`sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))`\n\nSquare both sides:\n`1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n\nIsolate the `v_max²/c²` term:\n`v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n\nFinally, multiply by `c²` and take the square root to find `v_max`:\n`v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²)`\n\n**6. Compare with the given options:**\nThe derived expression for `v_max` is:\n`v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}`\n\nThis matches option D exactly.\n\n**Alternative approach using total relativistic energy:**\nOne can also define the total conserved energy as `E_total = γmc² + U(x)`.\n*   At `x=A`, `v=0`, `γ=1`: `E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA²`.\n*   At `x=0`, `v=v_max`, `U=0`: `E_total = γ_max mc²`.\nEquating these gives `γ_max mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²`, which simplifies to `(γ_max - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA²`, the same equation as before, yielding the same result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In a conservative system like a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is constant.

This energy includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n    *   The potential energy of a mass attached to a spring obeying Hooke's Law ($F = -kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where we set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n3.  **Total Conserved Energy:** The total conserved energy ($E_{total}$) of the system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    This quantity remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n4.  **Analyze Two Key Points in the Oscillation:** We can find the value of this constant total energy by analyzing the system at a point where we know all the variables. Then we can use this value to solve for the unknown variable at another point. The two most convenient points are the position of maximum displacement (the amplitude) and the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **At maximum displacement (amplitude):**\n        *   Position: $x = A$\n        *   The mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (center of oscillation):**\n        *   Position: $x = 0$\n        *   The potential energy is minimum ($U(0) = 0$), so the kinetic energy (and thus speed) must be maximum. Let's call this maximum speed $v_{max}$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor at this point is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n5.  **Equate Energies and Solve for v_max:**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum displacement must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n    *   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n    *   Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   To solve for $v_{max}$, let's first isolate the square root term by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        $1-\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option D exactly.\n\n    *   A) is incorrect.\n    *   B) is incorrect.\n    *   C) corresponds to the non-relativistic case, which can be obtained from our result in the limit $c \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\to 0$, and using the binomial approximation $(1+x)^{-2} \\approx 1-2x$ for small $x$, we get $v_{max}^2 \\approx c^2(1-(1-2\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})) = c^2(\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}) = \\frac{kA^2}{m}$, so $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$. This confirms our relativistic formula has the correct non-relativistic limit.\n    *   D) is the correct relativistic result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is the step-by-step derivation for the maximum speed of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Define the system and conserved quantity.**\n    The system consists of a mass $m$ attached to a spring with spring constant $k$. The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. This force is conservative, and the corresponding potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    In a relativistic system, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energy of the mass and the potential energy. Since there are no non-conservative forces, the total energy is conserved.\n    The total energy $E_{total}$ at any point $x$ with velocity $v$ is given by:\n    $E_{total} = E_{relativistic} + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Analyze the energy at the point of maximum amplitude.**\n    The maximum amplitude is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, denoted by $x = A$.

Therefore, its velocity is zero ($v=0$).\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    Since total energy is conserved, this is the total energy of the oscillator throughout its motion.\n\n3.  **Analyze the energy at the equilibrium position.**\n    The equilibrium position is at $x=0$. At this point, the potential energy is zero ($U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$).\n    The restoring force is also zero at this point, which means the acceleration is zero. This is where the mass achieves its maximum speed, $v_{max}$.\n    The total energy at the equilibrium position is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n    where $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n4.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    Equate the total energy at the maximum amplitude ($x=A$) with the total energy at the equilibrium position ($x=0$):\n    Energy at $x=A$ = Energy at $x=0$\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.**\n    First, solve the energy equation for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to relate it to $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ we found:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we can first solve for the term $(1 - v_{max}^2/c^2)$:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$ by multiplying by $c^2$ and taking the square root:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The derived expression matches option C.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (Classical limit, incorrect)\n    *   B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ (Incorrect form)\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ (Correct)\n    *   D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ (Incorrect form and dimensions)\n\nThe correct expression for the maximum speed of the mass is given by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    For an isolated system, the total energy is conserved.
