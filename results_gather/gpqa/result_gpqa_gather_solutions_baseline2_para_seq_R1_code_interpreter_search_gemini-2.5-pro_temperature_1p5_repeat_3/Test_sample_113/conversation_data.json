This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The nucleophilic cyanide ion (⁻CN) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This forms an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. Looking at the options for A, `H₃O⁺` represents an acidic medium (like adding dilute HCl or H₂SO₄), which serves as the required proton source. `NaHSO₃` is used for forming bisulfite addition products and is not the standard reagent for this protonation step.

The general representation for an acid in an aqueous solution is the hydronium ion, H₃O⁺.

The reaction involves the addition of two water molecules across the C≡N triple bond.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** The reaction is shown with `B (H₂O)`, indicating that B is a catalyst used with water for the hydrolysis.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for B (from remaining choices C and D):**\n        *   `HCl` (from option C): Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. It is a standard and effective catalyst for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles. It protonates the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water, driving the reaction towards the carboxylic acid.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (from option D): Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it can provide protons, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical laboratory conditions. Stronger acids are required.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** HCl is the more suitable and conventional reagent for this transformation.\n\n3.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis of the first reaction, reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Based on the analysis of the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.\n    *   Combining these two findings, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction. The reactants are a ketone (butan-2-one) and a source of cyanide ions (NaCN). The product is a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds in two steps.\n        1.  **Nucleophilic attack:** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the π bond of the carbonyl group and forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n            CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃\n        2.  **Protonation:** The negatively charged alkoxide ion is then protonated by a proton source to form the final stable hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin.\n            CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂CH₃ (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must provide the proton (H⁺) for the second step. H₃O⁺, which represents a source of acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄ in water), is the standard reagent used to provide this proton.

This transformation is called hydrolysis.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires either a strong acid or a strong base as a catalyst, along with water and often heat.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** R-C≡N + 2H₂O + H⁺ (catalyst) → R-COOH + NH₄⁺\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** R-C≡N + H₂O + OH⁻ (catalyst) → R-COO⁻ + NH₃ (followed by acidification to get R-COOH)\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis. Looking at the options for B (CH₃COOH and HCl), HCl is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis. CH₃COOH is a weak acid and would not be effective enough for this transformation under typical conditions. Therefore, B = HCl.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.\n    *   Matching these findings with the given options, we find that option D fits perfectly.\n\n*   **Option Evaluation:**\n    *   A) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH - Incorrect.\n    *   B) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH - Incorrect, B is a weak acid.\n    *   C) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl - Incorrect, A is not the proton source.\n    *   D) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl - Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   Butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN provides the nucleophile, the cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    *   The mechanism involves the attack of the CN⁻ on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.
