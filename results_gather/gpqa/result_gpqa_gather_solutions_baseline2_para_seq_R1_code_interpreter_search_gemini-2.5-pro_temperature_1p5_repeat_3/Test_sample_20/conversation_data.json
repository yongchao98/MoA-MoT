The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom—a hydrogen atom on an sp3-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n    1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone, C₆H₄O₂):**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups at opposite positions.\n        *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring.\n        *   These alpha-carbons are sp2-hybridized, not sp3-hybridized.\n        *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on sp3-hybridized carbons, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C₆H₆O₃):**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.\n        *   These carbons (C2, C4, C6) are sp3-hybridized and are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons has two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   Due to the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can and does exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. It readily converts to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate):**\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since the carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and thus exhibits optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n    2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is the *trans* isomer, meaning the two methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C bond), which makes it achiral.\n        *   Since the molecule is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism. Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is an equilibrium between two constitutional isomers, most commonly keto-enol tautomers. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-hydrogen must be on an sp3 hybridized carbon for the process to occur readily.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Structure: It is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4, and double bonds between carbons 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   The alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyls) are C2, C6, C3, and C5.\n    *   All these alpha-carbons are sp2 hybridized because they are part of the ring's double bonds.\n    *   While they do have hydrogen atoms attached, removing one of these protons is difficult, and the process would disrupt the stable conjugated system of the molecule. Standard keto-enol tautomerism involves an alpha-hydrogen on an sp3 carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Structure: It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp3 hybridized.\n    *   The alpha-carbons are C2, C4, and C6. Each of these carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   These hydrogens are acidic because they are located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   The presence of these sp3 alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerization to form its enol, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore very stable.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n    *   Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group.\n    *   This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since it is bonded to four different groups, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   Structure: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the trans isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate.\n    *   The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, and the structure is planar.\n    *   It does not contain any chiral centers (no carbon is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where molecules can interconvert by the migration of an atom (usually hydrogen) and a shift in the location of a double bond. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon). This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds. The molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized, not sp³. They do not have the type of alpha-hydrogens required for standard keto-enol tautomerism. Converting it to its corresponding \"enol\" form (hydroquinone, C₆H₆(OH)₂) would require adding two hydrogen atoms, changing the molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂. Since tautomers must have the same molecular formula, this is a redox reaction, not tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The molecular formula is C₆H₆O₃. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms (-CH₂-). These are alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the negative charge on the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by two adjacent carbonyl groups. This compound readily undergoes tautomerism to form its enol, **phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene)**, which has the same molecular formula (C₆H₆O₃). The enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will show optical isomerism** (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. The molecule has a center of symmetry and is planar, meaning it is superimposable on its mirror image. It contains no chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer**\n\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where isomers can interconvert through a chemical reaction, most commonly the migration of a proton. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). This hydrogen is called an α-hydrogen.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Let's examine its structure. It is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons to two carbonyl groups each. Each of these α-carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (α-hydrogens). The presence of these acidic α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerization to form its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore very stable, meaning cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily exhibits tautomerism.\n         \n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** Let's examine its structure. It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4). The α-carbons (positions 2, 3, 5, and 6) are part of carbon-carbon double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). They do not have the typical structure of an α-carbon (sp³ hybridized) from which a proton can be easily removed to form an enol. Therefore, benzoquinone does not have α-hydrogens in the conventional sense required for keto-enol tautomerism. It cannot tautomerize.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Let's draw its structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH₃. Let's analyze the carbon atom at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-C(=O)OCH₃)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and thus exhibits optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OC(=O)CH=CH(C=O)OCH₃. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane containing all the atoms) and a center of inversion. Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does show geometric isomerism, as it is the *trans* isomer, and its *cis* counterpart is dimethyl maleate. But geometric isomerism is different from optical isomerism).\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers (called tautomers) that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton (H+) and a shift in a double bond. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, where a molecule containing a carbonyl group (keto form) is in equilibrium with its enol form (a molecule containing a hydroxyl group bonded to a carbon that is part of a C=C double bond).\n\n    2.  A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen**. This is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group. This alpha-carbon must typically be sp³ hybridized.\n\n    3.  Let's examine **benzoquinone** (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone).\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite positions (1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds.\n        *   Alpha-carbons: The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n        *   Alpha-hydrogens: Each of these alpha-carbons is part of a C=C double bond (they are sp² hybridized) and is bonded to one hydrogen atom.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon is the alpha-carbon.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH2- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogen atoms on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens because they are attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. In fact, these alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerization. It can lose protons and rearrange its double bonds to form its enol tautomer, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (also known as phloroglucinol).

The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups at opposite positions (1 and 4). The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Now, let's examine **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**. This molecule is a cyclic ketone with carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form, which is **phloroglucinol** (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).

Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This carbon is called the alpha-carbon (α-carbon), and the hydrogen is an alpha-hydrogen (α-hydrogen). The α-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered carbon ring with ketone groups (C=O) at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the α-carbons. They are sp³ hybridized and each has two α-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has sp³ α-carbons with α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it readily tautomerizes to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is highly stable due to aromaticity. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (specifically, 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds between positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. These α-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp² hybridized.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not have any α-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon. The requirement for standard keto-enol tautomerism is not met. Therefore, benzoquinone does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, will show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (or chiral center), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate *will* show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* configuration around the double bond:\n        ```\n          H      COOCH₃\n           \\    /\n            C==C\n           /    \\\n      CH₃OOC     H\n        ```\n    *   **Chirality:**\n        *   The molecule has no chiral centers (no carbon is attached to four different groups).\n        *   The molecule is largely planar and possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center) located at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the center of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on itself. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does **not** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Result for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Compilation**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism): **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism): **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a phenomenon where a single chemical compound tends to exist in two or more interconvertible structures that are different in terms of the relative position of one atomic nucleus, which is generally hydrogen.

These carbons are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized.\n        *   While these alpha-carbons do have hydrogen atoms attached, these are vinylic hydrogens. The typical mechanism for keto-enol tautomerism involves the removal of a proton from an sp³ hybridized alpha-carbon. The enolization of benzoquinone is not a favorable or spontaneous process under normal conditions; it would require a reduction reaction to form hydroquinone, which is not a tautomerization.\n        *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³ hybridized (CH₂ groups).

The stability gained from forming an aromatic ring is a very strong driving force, so cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists almost exclusively in its enol (aromatic) form.\n        *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs when a molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The carbon atoms of these CH₂ groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha to two carbonyl groups each. They have two acidic alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens can be removed, allowing the molecule to tautomerize to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is an aromatic compound, which is exceptionally stable. Due to this stabilization, the equilibrium heavily favors the aromatic enol form. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily exhibits tautomerism.\n        \n         ![Tautomerism of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione](https://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/IGOC/P/phloroglucinol01.png) \n        *The keto form has alpha-hydrogens and tautomerizes to the very stable aromatic enol form.*\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar around the double bond. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral center. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, meaning it is achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) from an alpha-carbon (a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group) to the carbonyl oxygen, along with a shift of a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, there must be at least one hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon.\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:** The structure of 1,4-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite ends.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds. These alpha-carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached that can be easily removed to form an enol.\n    *   Since there is no alpha-hydrogen on an sp³ carbon, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups separated by methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   The carbon atoms of the methylene groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha to two carbonyl groups. These are sp³-hybridized carbons.\n    *   The hydrogens on these methylene groups are highly acidic and readily available for tautomerization.\n    *   In fact, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists in equilibrium with its enol tautomer, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is aromatic and therefore exceptionally stable, meaning the compound exhibits tautomerism to a very large extent.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   This carbon is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, it will have two enantiomers (mirror images) and will show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers.\n    *   It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane containing all the atoms except for some hydrogens of the methyl groups) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on itself. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism. (It does have a geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate, but this is a different type of stereoisomerism).\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism. Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n*   A (does not show tautomerism) = benzoquinone\n*   B (shows optical isomerism) = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a phenomenon where a single compound exists in two or more interconvertible structures that are in equilibrium. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these alpha-carbons is a -CH2- group, meaning they possess alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism to form its enol form, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and thus very stable, meaning the equilibrium heavily favors the enol. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a ring structure with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons do not have any attached hydrogens that can be easily removed to form an enol; they lack the necessary alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone *does not* show keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** (a type of stereoisomerism) is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Chiral molecules exhibit optical isomerism. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate *will* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ and has a *trans* configuration around the double bond. The molecule is planar. Due to its symmetrical *trans* structure, it has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry are achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate *will not* show optical isomerism. (Note: It does exhibit geometric isomerism with its *cis* counterpart, dimethyl maleate).\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination:**\n    *   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon). This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds. The molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized, not sp³. They do not have the type of alpha-hydrogens required for standard keto-enol tautomerism. Converting it to its corresponding \"enol\" form (hydroquinone, C₆H₆(OH)₂) would require adding two hydrogen atoms, changing the molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂. Since tautomers must have the same molecular formula, this is a redox reaction, not tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The molecular formula is C₆H₆O₃. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms (-CH₂-). These are alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the negative charge on the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by two adjacent carbonyl groups. This compound readily undergoes tautomerism to form its enol, **phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene)**, which has the same molecular formula (C₆H₆O₃). The enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will show optical isomerism** (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. The molecule has a center of symmetry and is planar, meaning it is superimposable on its mirror image. It contains no chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer**\n\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where isomers can interconvert through a chemical reaction, most commonly the migration of a proton. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). This hydrogen is called an α-hydrogen.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Let's examine its structure. It is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons to two carbonyl groups each. Each of these α-carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (α-hydrogens). The presence of these acidic α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerization to form its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore very stable, meaning cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily exhibits tautomerism.\n         \n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** Let's examine its structure. It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4). The α-carbons (positions 2, 3, 5, and 6) are part of carbon-carbon double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). They do not have the typical structure of an α-carbon (sp³ hybridized) from which a proton can be easily removed to form an enol. Therefore, benzoquinone does not have α-hydrogens in the conventional sense required for keto-enol tautomerism. It cannot tautomerize.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Let's draw its structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH₃. Let's analyze the carbon atom at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-C(=O)OCH₃)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and thus exhibits optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OC(=O)CH=CH(C=O)OCH₃. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane containing all the atoms) and a center of inversion. Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does show geometric isomerism, as it is the *trans* isomer, and its *cis* counterpart is dimethyl maleate. But geometric isomerism is different from optical isomerism).\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers (called tautomers) that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton (H+) and a shift in a double bond. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, where a molecule containing a carbonyl group (keto form) is in equilibrium with its enol form (a molecule containing a hydroxyl group bonded to a carbon that is part of a C=C double bond).\n\n    2.  A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen**. This is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group. This alpha-carbon must typically be sp³ hybridized.\n\n    3.  Let's examine **benzoquinone** (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone).\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite positions (1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds.\n        *   Alpha-carbons: The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n        *   Alpha-hydrogens: Each of these alpha-carbons is part of a C=C double bond (they are sp² hybridized) and is bonded to one hydrogen atom. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon, benzoquinone cannot undergo the typical keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    4.

These hydrogens are highly acidic because the negative charge of the resulting carbanion (enolate) can be delocalized over two carbonyl groups.\n        *   This compound readily undergoes tautomerism. In fact, it exists almost exclusively in its aromatic enol form, **phloroglucinol** (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is much more stable.\n        *   Keto form (Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) ⇌ Enol form (Phloroglucinol)\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n    5.  **Conclusion for A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon is the alpha-carbon.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH2- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogen atoms on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens because they are attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. In fact, these alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerization. It can lose protons and rearrange its double bonds to form its enol tautomer, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (also known as phloroglucinol).

These carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached that fit the typical requirement for keto-enol tautomerism (i.e., hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized alpha-carbon).\n    *   **Tautomerization:** The conversion of benzoquinone to its corresponding 'enol', hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene), is a reduction reaction (it requires the addition of two electrons and two protons), not a simple tautomeric equilibrium.

Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Now, let's examine **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**. This molecule is a cyclic ketone with carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms.

This allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form, which is **phloroglucinol** (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).

This process requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These alpha-carbons are bonded to other carbon atoms within the ring and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Without an alpha-hydrogen, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n        \n         ![Structure of p-benzoquinone](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/P-Benzoquinone-2D-skeletal.svg/200px-P-Benzoquinone-2D-skeletal.svg.png) \n        *The alpha-carbons (adjacent to C=O) have no attached hydrogens.*\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups separated by CH₂ groups. The carbon atoms of these CH₂ groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha to two carbonyl groups each. They have two acidic alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens can be removed, allowing the molecule to tautomerize to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is an aromatic compound, which is exceptionally stable. Due to this stabilization, the equilibrium heavily favors the aromatic enol form. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily exhibits tautomerism.\n        \n         ![Tautomerism of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione](https://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/IGOC/P/phloroglucinol01.png) \n        *The keto form has alpha-hydrogens and tautomerizes to the very stable aromatic enol form.*\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. Thus, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Optical Isomerism for Compound B**\n\n    Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is typically chiral if it contains at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        \n        Since this carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism (it has two non-superimposable mirror images, or enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) on each of the double-bonded carbons. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar around the double bond. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral center. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, meaning it is achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism. Thus, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the Results**\n\n    Based on the analysis:\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n    This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. Keto-enol tautomerism is the most common form, involving the migration of a proton from a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an alpha-carbon) to the carbonyl oxygen atom. For this to occur, the molecule must possess at least one **alpha-hydrogen**.\n\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups (ketones) at opposite positions (para).\n        *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the C=O groups). These are the carbons involved in the C=C double bonds.\n        *   Crucially, these alpha-carbons are bonded to other carbons within the ring structure and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.\n        *   Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered saturated ring (cyclohexane) with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons, located between the carbonyl groups. Each of these is a -CH₂- group.\n        *   These carbons possess two alpha-hydrogens each. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, the molecule can readily tautomerize to its enol form. In fact, it can tautomerize three times to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and thus highly stable compound. The equilibrium strongly favors the aromatic enol form.\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** exhibit tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules.

A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound is a cyclic tri-ketone. The structure consists of a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. Each methylene group is located between two carbonyl groups, making the hydrogens on these carbons (alpha-hydrogens) particularly acidic. These alpha-hydrogens can easily be removed, allowing the compound to tautomerize into its highly stable enol form, which is phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), an aromatic compound.

The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. Chiral molecules exhibit optical isomerism (existing as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center) halfway along the C=C bond.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) from an alpha-carbon (a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group) to the carbonyl oxygen, along with a shift of a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, there must be at least one hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon.\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:** The structure of 1,4-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite ends.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds. These alpha-carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached that can be easily removed to form an enol.\n    *   Since there is no alpha-hydrogen on an sp³ carbon, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups separated by methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   The carbon atoms of the methylene groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha to two carbonyl groups. These are sp³-hybridized carbons.\n    *   The hydrogens on these methylene groups are highly acidic and readily available for tautomerization.\n    *   In fact, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists in equilibrium with its enol tautomer, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is aromatic and therefore exceptionally stable, meaning the compound exhibits tautomerism to a very large extent.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   This carbon is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, it will have two enantiomers (mirror images) and will show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers.\n    *   It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane containing all the atoms except for some hydrogens of the methyl groups) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on itself. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism. (It does have a geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate, but this is a different type of stereoisomerism).\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism. Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n*   A (does not show tautomerism) = benzoquinone\n*   B (shows optical isomerism) = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a phenomenon where a single compound exists in two or more interconvertible structures that are in equilibrium. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these alpha-carbons is a -CH2- group, meaning they possess alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism to form its enol form, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and thus very stable, meaning the equilibrium heavily favors the enol. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a ring structure with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons do not have any attached hydrogens that can be easily removed to form an enol; they lack the necessary alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone *does not* show keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** (a type of stereoisomerism) is exhibited by chiral molecules.

The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Chiral molecules exhibit optical isomerism. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate *will* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ and has a *trans* configuration around the double bond. The molecule is planar. Due to its symmetrical *trans* structure, it has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry are achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate *will not* show optical isomerism.
