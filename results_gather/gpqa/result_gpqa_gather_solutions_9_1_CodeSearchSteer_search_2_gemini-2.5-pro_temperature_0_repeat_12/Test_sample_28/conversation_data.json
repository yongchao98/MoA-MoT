Let's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence, reading it in codons (groups of three nucleotides) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene Sequence and Protein:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n\nThis is the functional protein that produces the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Mutants:**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (Phe -> Phe, a silent mutation) and `CTC` -> `TAC` (Leu -> Tyr, a missense mutation).\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n    *   **Effect:** This is a missense mutation, which changes one amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (Phe -> Phe, a silent mutation) and `CTC` -> `TAA`.\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Effect:** The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to terminate prematurely, creating a tiny, non-functional protein fragment only two amino acids long. This is highly likely to completely eliminate the gene's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence has multiple changes compared to the intact gene, resulting in several amino acid substitutions (missense mutations).\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** - **Thr** - **Ser**...\n    *   **Effect:** Multiple missense mutations change several amino acids. While this is more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it does not guarantee a complete loss of function. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** Comparing to the intact gene (`...GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n    *   **Effect:** This is an in-frame deletion. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) from the protein and also contains a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`). Like a missense mutation, deleting a single amino acid might disrupt the protein, but it is not guaranteed to completely inactivate it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective way to eliminate the function of a gene is to prevent the synthesis of a full-length, functional protein. **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This will result in a severely truncated and non-functional protein, thus most probably eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein's synthesis. The goal is to find the mutation that most probably results in a non-functional protein. This is typically achieved by a \"knockout\" mutation that stops the protein from being made correctly.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the intact gene's initial sequence to understand its translation into amino acids. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons. The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the standard start codon that codes for the amino acid Methionine and signals the beginning of protein translation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine...\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is substituted for another. While this could potentially alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is one of the three **stop codons** (along with TGA and TAG). This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the machinery of the cell to stop protein synthesis prematurely. This results in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant has two changes compared to the intact gene. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this might affect protein function, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant also has two **missense mutations**. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the fifth codon `GGT` (Glycine) becomes `ACT` (Threonine). Again, this is less likely to completely eliminate the protein's function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene sequence. This nonsense mutation will halt protein synthesis, leading to a very short and non-functional protein product. This is the most direct and probable way to eliminate the function of the protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutants only cause amino acid substitutions (missense mutations), which may or may not inactivate the protein. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most desirable outcome for the stated goal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine which mutation will most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the gene's protein product. A non-functional protein cannot synthesize the compound.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** First, we'll establish the baseline by translating the beginning of the original gene sequence into its amino acid sequence. The gene starts with `ATG` (the start codon) and ends with `TGA` (a stop codon).\n2.  **Analyze Each Mutant:** We will examine each mutant sequence to identify the type of mutation and its effect on the resulting protein.\n    *   A **missense mutation** changes one amino acid, which might or might not disable the protein.\n    *   An **in-frame deletion/insertion** removes or adds an entire amino acid, which also might or might not disable the protein.\n    *   A **frameshift mutation** (caused by an insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three) changes the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   A **nonsense mutation** changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon, which terminates protein synthesis prematurely, resulting in a truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n3.  **Compare the Effects:** The most severe disruptions are frameshift and nonsense mutations, as they are most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein. We will identify which mutant has the most disruptive mutation.\n\nLet's execute the analysis with Python.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_mutations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes gene mutations to determine which is most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the DNA codon table for translation ('*' = STOP codon)\n    codon_table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M', 'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K', 'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L', 'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q', 'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V', 'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E', 'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S', 'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'*', 'TAG':'*', 'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'*', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n\n    def translate(seq):\n        protein = \"\"\n        for i in range(0, len(seq) - (len(seq) % 3), 3):\n            codon = seq[i:i+3]\n            amino_acid = codon_table.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown\n            if amino_acid == '*':\n                protein += '*'\n                break\n            protein += amino_acid\n        return protein\n\n    # Gene sequences\n    intact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    mutant_1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n    mutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n    mutant_3 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    mutant_4 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Gene Mutations:\\n\")\n\n    # Intact Gene\n    print(f\"Intact Gene:        ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\")\n    print(f\"Translated Protein: {translate(intact_gene)}\")\n    print(\"Analysis: This is the original, functional protein.\\n\")\n\n    # Mutant 1\n    print(f\"Mutant 1:           ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...\")\n    print(f\"Translated Protein: {translate(mutant_1)}\")\n    print(\"Analysis: This is a missense mutation (Leucine -> Tyrosine).

This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to disrupt the function of this protein, ideally by creating a \"knockout\" mutation that results in a non-functional or absent protein.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe provided sequence is the beginning of the coding region (first exon) of the gene.\nIntact gene: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n\nLet's break this sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides) to determine the original amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with `ATG`, which is the start codon.\n*   `ATG` - Methionine (Met) - Start codon\n*   `TTT` - Phenylalanine (Phe)\n*   `CTC` - Leucine (Leu)\n*   `GCT` - Alanine (Ala)\n*   `GGT` - Glycine (Gly)\n*   `ACT` - Threonine (Thr)\n*   ...and so on.\n\nThe goal is to find a mutation that causes the most significant disruption to the protein that will be translated from this sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant Individually**\n\n**Careful Point:** The most effective mutations for knocking out gene function are typically **nonsense mutations** (which create a premature stop codon) or **frameshift mutations** (insertions or deletions of nucleotides not in a multiple of three). These are generally more disruptive than **missense mutations** (which change one amino acid to another) or **silent mutations** (which don't change the amino acid at all).\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC ...` (Met-Phe-Leu...)\n        *   Mutant 1: `ATG TTC TAC ...` (Met-Phe-Tyr...)\n    *   Analysis: The codon `TTT` has changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a silent mutation. The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid. While this *could* affect protein function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC ...` (Met-Phe-Leu...)\n        *   Mutant 2: `ATG TTC TAA ...`\n    *   Analysis: The codon `TTT` has changed to `TTC` (a silent mutation, as in Mutant 1). The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Impact:** This mutation will cause the ribosome to stop translation after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A protein this severely truncated is almost certain to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...` (Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...)\n        *   Mutant 3: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ...` (Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly-Val...)\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the codon `ACT` (Threonine) has changed to `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, this changes the amino acid sequence, but it doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Mutant 4: `ATG TTT TAC GCT --- ACT TCT ...`\n    *   Analysis: There are two changes here. First, the codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), which is a **missense mutation**. Second, the codon `GGT` (Glycine) has been deleted entirely. Since a full codon (3 nucleotides) was deleted, this is an **in-frame deletion**. The reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved, but the final protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another one changed (Leu to Tyr). While this is a significant change, it is less likely to cause a complete knockout than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Mutations and Conclude**\n*   Mutant 1: One amino acid change. (Less likely to be a knockout)\n*   **Mutant 2: Introduces a premature STOP codon. Protein synthesis stops almost immediately. (Most likely to be a knockout)**\n*   Mutant 3: Two amino acid changes. (Less likely to be a knockout)\n*   Mutant 4: One amino acid change and one amino acid deletion. (Significant, but less certain to be a knockout than a premature stop codon).\n\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most drastic change, leading to a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to create a non-functional protein. This is typically achieved by a mutation that causes a major disruption in the protein's structure, such as a frameshift or a premature stop codon.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**1. Intact Gene:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT CTC GCT**...-3’\n*   Translation:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   Protein Start: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n**2. Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAC GCT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `TTT` -> `TTC` and `CTC` -> `TAC`.\n*   Translation:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Note: `TTT` and `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine, so this is a silent mutation).\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Note: `CTC` for Leucine is changed to `TAC` for Tyrosine. This is a missense mutation).\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   Protein Start: Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala...\n*   Effect: This is a missense mutation, which changes one amino acid. The resulting protein is altered, but it may or may not be functional. It is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than other types of mutations.\n\n**3. Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAA GCT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `TTT` -> `TTC` and `CTC` -> `TAA`.\n*   Translation:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `TAA` -> **STOP**\n*   Protein Start: Met-Phe-STOP\n*   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a stop codon, which signals the ribosome to terminate translation. This will result in a very short, truncated protein containing only two amino acids. This protein will almost certainly be non-functional.\n\n**4. Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `CTC` -> `TAC` (missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr) and an insertion of `GTC` after `GGT`.\n*   Effect: This mutation causes one amino acid change and an insertion of a single amino acid (Valine, from `GTC`). Because a full codon (3 bases) was inserted, the reading frame is not shifted. This is an in-frame insertion. The protein is altered but may still be functional.\n\n**5. Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `CTC` -> `TAC` (missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n*   Effect: This mutation causes one amino acid change and the deletion of one amino acid (Glycine, from `GGT`). Because a full codon was deleted, this is an in-frame deletion. The protein is altered but may still be functional.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene. This leads to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most effective way among the given options to \"knock out\" the gene's function and thus eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein product. The goal is to find the mutation most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG TTT CTC...`, where `ATG` is the start codon. The protein synthesis starts here.\n\nLet's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC...`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC`), the second codon `TTT` has changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for the amino acid Phenylalanine, making this a **silent mutation** with no effect on the protein sequence.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. A missense mutation might alter or even eliminate protein function, but it is not guaranteed. The effect depends on the importance of that specific amino acid to the protein's structure and function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA...`\n    *   The second codon change (`TTT` to `TTC`) is a silent mutation, as in Mutant 1.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a very short, truncated protein (in this case, only two amino acids long). A truncated protein is almost always non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   This sequence appears to have multiple single-base changes compared to the intact gene. However, a closer look at the sequence `ATGTTT**T**ACG...` reveals an insertion of a single nucleotide (`T`) after the second codon.\n    *   An insertion of a number of bases not divisible by three causes a **frameshift mutation**. This alters the three-base-pair reading frame for all subsequent codons, leading to a completely different and usually non-functional amino acid sequence, which often ends in a premature stop codon. Like a nonsense mutation, a frameshift mutation is very likely to eliminate protein function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   This sequence is difficult to interpret as a single, simple mutational event like those typically caused by EMS. It appears to involve multiple substitutions or a combination of a substitution and a deletion. For instance, if we assume the `GGT` codon was deleted and the `CTC` codon was changed to `TAC`, this would be a complex mutation. An in-frame deletion (of 3 bases) would remove an amino acid, which may or may not eliminate function, while a missense mutation has an uncertain effect. Due to its complexity and ambiguity, it is a less likely candidate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and a frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are highly likely to result in a complete loss of protein function. However, the problem states that the mutants were generated using EMS. EMS is a chemical mutagen that primarily causes point mutations (substitutions), particularly G:C to A:T transitions, and is less likely to cause insertions or deletions.\n\n*   The change in **Mutant 2** (`CTC` to `TAA`) is a point mutation (a substitution).\n*   The change in **Mutant 3** is an insertion.\n\nGiven that EMS was used, a point mutation is a more probable event than an insertion. The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is a point mutation that is virtually guaranteed to eliminate the protein's function by creating a severely truncated product. Therefore, it is the most probable mutation to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the one that would most severely disrupt the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is typically achieved by a mutation that leads to a non-functional or truncated protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Mutations\n\nFirst, let's establish the reading frame from the intact gene sequence. The sequence begins with `ATG`, the start codon, so the codons are read in groups of three from the beginning.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   This translates to: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, the `TTT` codon is now `TTC`, and `CTC` is now `TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` to `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine (a silent mutation).\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it might also have little to no effect, especially if the amino acids have similar properties or are not in a critical region of the protein. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   Here, the `CTC` codon for Leucine has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   This mutation causes translation to stop prematurely, resulting in a severely shortened protein (only two amino acids long in this case). A truncated protein of this nature is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`…-3’\n    *   Comparing the codons to the intact gene:\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   `ACT` (Threonine) changes to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   This mutant contains at least two **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this changes amino acids but still produces a full-length protein. The functional impact is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`…-3’\n    *   Comparing the codons to the intact gene:\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   `GGT` (Glycine) changes to `GCT` (Alanine).\n    *   This mutant also contains two **missense mutations**. Like mutants 1 and 3, it produces a full-length protein with a few amino acid changes, making the loss of function less certain than a nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAmong the given options, a nonsense mutation is the most likely to cause a complete loss of function. Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This will halt protein synthesis and produce a tiny, non-functional peptide, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. While frameshift mutations are also highly effective at knocking out genes, Mutant 2 clearly and unambiguously represents a nonsense mutation, the most severe type among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the most effective strategy is to \"knock out\" the gene responsible for its synthesis. This means introducing a mutation that renders the protein produced by the gene non-functional. Let's analyze the effects of each mutation.\n\nThe intact gene's initial codons are:\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\nThis translates to the amino acid sequence:\nMet - Phe - Leu - Ala...\n\nNow let's examine the mutants:\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codons are `ATG` (Met), `TTC` (Phe), and `TAC` (Tyr).\n    *   This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid (Leucine) is replaced by another (Tyrosine). While this might alter the protein's function, it doesn't guarantee it will be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codons are `ATG` (Met), `TTC` (Phe), and `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to halt prematurely, resulting in a very short, truncated protein (only two amino acids long). A nonsense mutation that occurs so early in the gene sequence is highly likely to produce a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains multiple amino acid changes compared to the original.\n    *   This represents multiple **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, it results in a full-length protein with some altered amino acids. This might affect function, but it is less certain to eliminate it entirely compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Comparing this to the intact gene, a missense mutation has occurred (`CTC` to `TAC`), and the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   Since a full codon (three bases) was removed, the reading frame is not shifted. This is an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another substituted (Leucine to Tyrosine). This is less likely to completely abolish protein function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating the function of a protein is the one that prevents a full-length, functional version from being made. The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop signal at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is the most probable option to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the genetic mutations in each mutant line and determine which one is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional protein is most reliably produced by a mutation that severely disrupts the gene's reading frame or introduces a premature stop codon.\n\nLet's break down the DNA sequence into codons (three-base units) and translate them into amino acids for the intact gene and each mutant. The standard genetic code will be used for translation. The gene starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene Sequence:**\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp - Glu - His - Ile - Tyr - Cys - Arg...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes one amino acid.\n*   **Effect:** A single amino acid change might or might not inactivate the protein. Its function could be reduced, altered, or unaffected. It is not the most certain way to eliminate function.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. This is a silent mutation (Phe).\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAA`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. The translation will terminate after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This truncated protein will be non-functional. This is the most likely mutation to completely eliminate the synthesis of the target compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. Missense mutation (Leu -> Tyr).\n    *   Codon 6: `ACT` -> `GTC`. `ACT` codes for Threonine (Thr), while `GTC` codes for Valine (Val). This is another **missense mutation**.\n*   **Effect:** This mutant has two amino acid changes. While this increases the chance of disrupting the protein's function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon. The protein is still fully translated.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact: The mutant sequence is shorter.\n    *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` (Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...)\n    *   Mutant: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` (Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...)\n    *   The sequence `CTC GCT GGT` (coding for Leu-Ala-Gly) in the intact gene has been effectively changed to `TAC GCT` (coding for Tyr-Ala), and the reading frame continues from there. This represents a combination of a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of one codon (`GGT`).\n*   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (deletion of 3 bases) combined with a missense mutation. The protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another changed (Leu to Tyr), but the rest of the protein will be translated correctly. This might inactivate the protein, but like missense mutations, the outcome is not as certain as a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating a protein's function is the one that causes the most severe disruption. A nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a severely truncated and guaranteed non-functional protein. The other mutations (missense and in-frame deletion) result in a full-length or near-full-length protein with one or two amino acid changes, which may or may not be sufficient to eliminate its function. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable candidate to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the most effective mutation:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by a specific gene. To stop the compound's synthesis, we need to disrupt the gene so that it no longer produces a functional protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Gene:** The intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`, which is the universal start codon (Methionine). It ends with `...TGA-3’`, which is one of the three stop codons. The protein synthesis starts at `ATG` and continues until a stop codon is reached.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Types of Mutations:**\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. This *might* disrupt protein function, especially if the change occurs in a critical region, but it could also have little to no effect.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a premature stop codon. This truncates the protein, and if it occurs early in the sequence, it almost always results in a non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation (Insertion/Deletion):** The insertion or deletion of nucleotides (not in a multiple of three). This shifts the reading frame, changing every subsequent amino acid. This typically leads to a completely different and non-functional protein, often encountering a premature stop codon in the new frame.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Mutant Sequence:** We will break down each DNA sequence into three-letter codons and translate them into amino acids to see the effect of the mutation. The genetic code will be used for translation (`_` represents a stop codon).\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...`\n        *   This is our baseline for a functional protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Thr ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes a single amino acid. This might not be enough to completely inactivate the protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - STOP`\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA` (a stop codon). This is a **nonsense mutation**. Translation will stop after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This peptide will almost certainly be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val). These are two **missense mutations**. While two changes are more disruptive than one, it is still not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Thr - Ser ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence also contains two changes: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `GGT` (Gly) -> `ACT` (Thr). These are two **missense mutations**. Again, this is not as certain to eliminate function as a premature stop codon.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most effective way to ensure a gene is knocked out is to prevent the synthesis of a full-length protein. Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is the most drastic and definitive change among the options, making it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify the mutation that is most likely to create a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein is most reliably produced by a mutation that causes a major disruption, such as a premature stop to protein synthesis.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in three-base-pair units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene (Control)**\n*   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\n*   **Codons:** `ATG` (Methionine/Start), `TTT` (Phenylalanine), `CTC` (Leucine), `GCT` (Alanine), `GGT` (Glycine)\n*   **Protein Sequence:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...\nThis is the functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n**Analysis of Mutants**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n    *   **Effect:**\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation** with no effect on the protein.\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine): This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to inactivate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` becomes `TAA`.\n    *   **Effect:**\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: This is a silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAA` (**STOP**): This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a stop codon, which signals the ribosome to terminate protein synthesis.\n    *   **Result:** Protein synthesis will stop after only two amino acids have been joined. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional. This mutation will almost certainly eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val).

This is an **in-frame deletion** because a full codon (3 bases) is removed, which deletes an amino acid without shifting the reading frame. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid and have another changed. This is a significant alteration but does not guarantee complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe because it introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene. This will halt protein synthesis, resulting in a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most reliable way to \"knock out\" the gene's function among the choices provided.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.

When the ribosome encounters this codon, it terminates translation. This results in a severely truncated protein containing only two amino acids. Such a short peptide is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n**4. Mutant 3 Analysis**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`... -3’\n*   **Change:** Two changes are present.

Mutant 4 Analysis**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`... -3’\n*   **Change:** Comparing to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), we see that the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...\n*   **Effect:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** (Leu -> Tyr) and an **in-frame deletion** (the Glycine codon `GGT` is removed). Because three bases (one full codon) were removed, the reading frame is not shifted. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another amino acid changed. This alters the protein, but like a missense mutation, it doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most drastic and reliable way to eliminate a protein's function among the given options is to introduce a premature stop codon, as seen in Mutant 2.

Therefore, the most effective approach is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional or completely absent protein. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Likely Effects**\nTo evaluate the mutants, it's crucial to understand the different types of mutations and their impact on protein synthesis:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes a single nucleotide, resulting in a codon that codes for a different amino acid. This alters the protein sequence but may or may not inactivate the protein. The protein is still produced at its full length.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. Like a missense mutation, this may or may not inactivate the protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon that specifies an amino acid into a termination (STOP) codon. This causes protein synthesis to stop prematurely, resulting in a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost always non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame, changing every amino acid after the mutation and usually leading to a premature stop codon.\n\nOf these, nonsense and frameshift mutations are the most likely to cause a complete loss of protein function.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe genetic code is read in triplets (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be eliminated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a STOP codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which will be non-functional. This is the most effective way to knock out the gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`).\n    *   **Effect:** A full-length protein is produced with two altered amino acids. The effect on function is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This involves a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n    *   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (one amino acid removed) combined with a missense mutation. The protein is slightly shorter and altered, but the effect on function is still less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is the most severe type of mutation among the choices, as it guarantees the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Let's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence, reading it in codons (groups of three nucleotides) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene Sequence and Protein:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n\nThis is the functional protein that produces the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Mutants:**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (Phe -> Phe, a silent mutation) and `CTC` -> `TAC` (Leu -> Tyr, a missense mutation).\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n    *   **Effect:** This is a missense mutation, which changes one amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (Phe -> Phe, a silent mutation) and `CTC` -> `TAA`.\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Effect:** The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to terminate prematurely, creating a tiny, non-functional protein fragment only two amino acids long. This is highly likely to completely eliminate the gene's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence has multiple changes compared to the intact gene, resulting in several amino acid substitutions (missense mutations).\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** - **Thr** - **Ser**...\n    *   **Effect:** Multiple missense mutations change several amino acids. While this is more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it does not guarantee a complete loss of function. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** Comparing to the intact gene (`...GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n    *   **Effect:** This is an in-frame deletion. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) from the protein and also contains a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`). Like a missense mutation, deleting a single amino acid might disrupt the protein, but it is not guaranteed to completely inactivate it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective way to eliminate the function of a gene is to prevent the synthesis of a full-length, functional protein. **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This will result in a severely truncated and non-functional protein, thus most probably eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein's synthesis. The goal is to find the mutation that most probably results in a non-functional protein. This is typically achieved by a \"knockout\" mutation that stops the protein from being made correctly.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the intact gene's initial sequence to understand its translation into amino acids. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons. The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the standard start codon that codes for the amino acid Methionine and signals the beginning of protein translation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine...\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is substituted for another. While this could potentially alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is one of the three **stop codons** (along with TGA and TAG). This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the machinery of the cell to stop protein synthesis prematurely. This results in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant has two changes compared to the intact gene. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this might affect protein function, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant also has two **missense mutations**. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the fifth codon `GGT` (Glycine) becomes `ACT` (Threonine). Again, this is less likely to completely eliminate the protein's function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene sequence. This nonsense mutation will halt protein synthesis, leading to a very short and non-functional protein product. This is the most direct and probable way to eliminate the function of the protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutants only cause amino acid substitutions (missense mutations), which may or may not inactivate the protein. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most desirable outcome for the stated goal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine which mutation will most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the gene's protein product. A non-functional protein cannot synthesize the compound.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** First, we'll establish the baseline by translating the beginning of the original gene sequence into its amino acid sequence. The gene starts with `ATG` (the start codon) and ends with `TGA` (a stop codon).\n2.  **Analyze Each Mutant:** We will examine each mutant sequence to identify the type of mutation and its effect on the resulting protein.\n    *   A **missense mutation** changes one amino acid, which might or might not disable the protein.\n    *   An **in-frame deletion/insertion** removes or adds an entire amino acid, which also might or might not disable the protein.\n    *   A **frameshift mutation** (caused by an insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three) changes the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   A **nonsense mutation** changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon, which terminates protein synthesis prematurely, resulting in a truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n3.  **Compare the Effects:** The most severe disruptions are frameshift and nonsense mutations, as they are most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein. We will identify which mutant has the most disruptive mutation.\n\nLet's execute the analysis with Python.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_mutations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes gene mutations to determine which is most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the DNA codon table for translation ('*' = STOP codon)\n    codon_table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M', 'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K', 'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L', 'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q', 'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V', 'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E', 'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S', 'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'*', 'TAG':'*', 'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'*', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n\n    def translate(seq):\n        protein = \"\"\n        for i in range(0, len(seq) - (len(seq) % 3), 3):\n            codon = seq[i:i+3]\n            amino_acid = codon_table.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown\n            if amino_acid == '*':\n                protein += '*'\n                break\n            protein += amino_acid\n        return protein\n\n    # Gene sequences\n    intact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    mutant_1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n    mutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n    mutant_3 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    mutant_4 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Gene Mutations:\\n\")\n\n    # Intact Gene\n    print(f\"Intact Gene:        ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\")\n    print(f\"Translated Protein: {translate(intact_gene)}\")\n    print(\"Analysis: This is the original, functional protein.\\n\")\n\n    # Mutant 1\n    print(f\"Mutant 1:           ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...\")\n    print(f\"Translated Protein: {translate(mutant_1)}\")\n    print(\"Analysis: This is a missense mutation (Leucine -> Tyrosine).

This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to disrupt the function of this protein, ideally by creating a \"knockout\" mutation that results in a non-functional or absent protein.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe provided sequence is the beginning of the coding region (first exon) of the gene.\nIntact gene: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n\nLet's break this sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides) to determine the original amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with `ATG`, which is the start codon.\n*   `ATG` - Methionine (Met) - Start codon\n*   `TTT` - Phenylalanine (Phe)\n*   `CTC` - Leucine (Leu)\n*   `GCT` - Alanine (Ala)\n*   `GGT` - Glycine (Gly)\n*   `ACT` - Threonine (Thr)\n*   ...and so on.\n\nThe goal is to find a mutation that causes the most significant disruption to the protein that will be translated from this sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant Individually**\n\n**Careful Point:** The most effective mutations for knocking out gene function are typically **nonsense mutations** (which create a premature stop codon) or **frameshift mutations** (insertions or deletions of nucleotides not in a multiple of three). These are generally more disruptive than **missense mutations** (which change one amino acid to another) or **silent mutations** (which don't change the amino acid at all).\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC ...` (Met-Phe-Leu...)\n        *   Mutant 1: `ATG TTC TAC ...` (Met-Phe-Tyr...)\n    *   Analysis: The codon `TTT` has changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a silent mutation. The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid. While this *could* affect protein function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC ...` (Met-Phe-Leu...)\n        *   Mutant 2: `ATG TTC TAA ...`\n    *   Analysis: The codon `TTT` has changed to `TTC` (a silent mutation, as in Mutant 1). The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Impact:** This mutation will cause the ribosome to stop translation after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A protein this severely truncated is almost certain to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...` (Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...)\n        *   Mutant 3: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ...` (Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly-Val...)\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the codon `ACT` (Threonine) has changed to `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, this changes the amino acid sequence, but it doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Mutant 4: `ATG TTT TAC GCT --- ACT TCT ...`\n    *   Analysis: There are two changes here. First, the codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), which is a **missense mutation**. Second, the codon `GGT` (Glycine) has been deleted entirely. Since a full codon (3 nucleotides) was deleted, this is an **in-frame deletion**. The reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved, but the final protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another one changed (Leu to Tyr). While this is a significant change, it is less likely to cause a complete knockout than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Mutations and Conclude**\n*   Mutant 1: One amino acid change. (Less likely to be a knockout)\n*   **Mutant 2: Introduces a premature STOP codon. Protein synthesis stops almost immediately. (Most likely to be a knockout)**\n*   Mutant 3: Two amino acid changes. (Less likely to be a knockout)\n*   Mutant 4: One amino acid change and one amino acid deletion. (Significant, but less certain to be a knockout than a premature stop codon).\n\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most drastic change, leading to a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to create a non-functional protein. This is typically achieved by a mutation that causes a major disruption in the protein's structure, such as a frameshift or a premature stop codon.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**1. Intact Gene:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT CTC GCT**...-3’\n*   Translation:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   Protein Start: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n**2. Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAC GCT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `TTT` -> `TTC` and `CTC` -> `TAC`.\n*   Translation:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Note: `TTT` and `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine, so this is a silent mutation).\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Note: `CTC` for Leucine is changed to `TAC` for Tyrosine. This is a missense mutation).\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   Protein Start: Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala...\n*   Effect: This is a missense mutation, which changes one amino acid. The resulting protein is altered, but it may or may not be functional. It is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than other types of mutations.\n\n**3. Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAA GCT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `TTT` -> `TTC` and `CTC` -> `TAA`.\n*   Translation:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `TAA` -> **STOP**\n*   Protein Start: Met-Phe-STOP\n*   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a stop codon, which signals the ribosome to terminate translation. This will result in a very short, truncated protein containing only two amino acids. This protein will almost certainly be non-functional.\n\n**4. Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `CTC` -> `TAC` (missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr) and an insertion of `GTC` after `GGT`.\n*   Effect: This mutation causes one amino acid change and an insertion of a single amino acid (Valine, from `GTC`). Because a full codon (3 bases) was inserted, the reading frame is not shifted. This is an in-frame insertion. The protein is altered but may still be functional.\n\n**5. Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `CTC` -> `TAC` (missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n*   Effect: This mutation causes one amino acid change and the deletion of one amino acid (Glycine, from `GGT`). Because a full codon was deleted, this is an in-frame deletion. The protein is altered but may still be functional.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene. This leads to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most effective way among the given options to \"knock out\" the gene's function and thus eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein product.

Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for the amino acid Phenylalanine, making this a **silent mutation** with no effect on the protein sequence.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. A missense mutation might alter or even eliminate protein function, but it is not guaranteed. The effect depends on the importance of that specific amino acid to the protein's structure and function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA...`\n    *   The second codon change (`TTT` to `TTC`) is a silent mutation, as in Mutant 1.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a very short, truncated protein (in this case, only two amino acids long). A truncated protein is almost always non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   This sequence appears to have multiple single-base changes compared to the intact gene. However, a closer look at the sequence `ATGTTT**T**ACG...` reveals an insertion of a single nucleotide (`T`) after the second codon.\n    *   An insertion of a number of bases not divisible by three causes a **frameshift mutation**. This alters the three-base-pair reading frame for all subsequent codons, leading to a completely different and usually non-functional amino acid sequence, which often ends in a premature stop codon. Like a nonsense mutation, a frameshift mutation is very likely to eliminate protein function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   This sequence is difficult to interpret as a single, simple mutational event like those typically caused by EMS. It appears to involve multiple substitutions or a combination of a substitution and a deletion. For instance, if we assume the `GGT` codon was deleted and the `CTC` codon was changed to `TAC`, this would be a complex mutation. An in-frame deletion (of 3 bases) would remove an amino acid, which may or may not eliminate function, while a missense mutation has an uncertain effect. Due to its complexity and ambiguity, it is a less likely candidate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and a frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are highly likely to result in a complete loss of protein function. However, the problem states that the mutants were generated using EMS. EMS is a chemical mutagen that primarily causes point mutations (substitutions), particularly G:C to A:T transitions, and is less likely to cause insertions or deletions.\n\n*   The change in **Mutant 2** (`CTC` to `TAA`) is a point mutation (a substitution).\n*   The change in **Mutant 3** is an insertion.\n\nGiven that EMS was used, a point mutation is a more probable event than an insertion. The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is a point mutation that is virtually guaranteed to eliminate the protein's function by creating a severely truncated product. Therefore, it is the most probable mutation to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the one that would most severely disrupt the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is typically achieved by a mutation that leads to a non-functional or truncated protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Mutations\n\nFirst, let's establish the reading frame from the intact gene sequence. The sequence begins with `ATG`, the start codon, so the codons are read in groups of three from the beginning.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   This translates to: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, the `TTT` codon is now `TTC`, and `CTC` is now `TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` to `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine (a silent mutation).\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it might also have little to no effect, especially if the amino acids have similar properties or are not in a critical region of the protein. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   Here, the `CTC` codon for Leucine has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   This mutation causes translation to stop prematurely, resulting in a severely shortened protein (only two amino acids long in this case). A truncated protein of this nature is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`…-3’\n    *   Comparing the codons to the intact gene:\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   `ACT` (Threonine) changes to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   This mutant contains at least two **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this changes amino acids but still produces a full-length protein. The functional impact is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`…-3’\n    *   Comparing the codons to the intact gene:\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   `GGT` (Glycine) changes to `GCT` (Alanine).\n    *   This mutant also contains two **missense mutations**. Like mutants 1 and 3, it produces a full-length protein with a few amino acid changes, making the loss of function less certain than a nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAmong the given options, a nonsense mutation is the most likely to cause a complete loss of function. Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This will halt protein synthesis and produce a tiny, non-functional peptide, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. While frameshift mutations are also highly effective at knocking out genes, Mutant 2 clearly and unambiguously represents a nonsense mutation, the most severe type among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the most effective strategy is to \"knock out\" the gene responsible for its synthesis. This means introducing a mutation that renders the protein produced by the gene non-functional. Let's analyze the effects of each mutation.\n\nThe intact gene's initial codons are:\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\nThis translates to the amino acid sequence:\nMet - Phe - Leu - Ala...\n\nNow let's examine the mutants:\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codons are `ATG` (Met), `TTC` (Phe), and `TAC` (Tyr).\n    *   This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid (Leucine) is replaced by another (Tyrosine). While this might alter the protein's function, it doesn't guarantee it will be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codons are `ATG` (Met), `TTC` (Phe), and `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to halt prematurely, resulting in a very short, truncated protein (only two amino acids long). A nonsense mutation that occurs so early in the gene sequence is highly likely to produce a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains multiple amino acid changes compared to the original.\n    *   This represents multiple **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, it results in a full-length protein with some altered amino acids. This might affect function, but it is less certain to eliminate it entirely compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Comparing this to the intact gene, a missense mutation has occurred (`CTC` to `TAC`), and the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   Since a full codon (three bases) was removed, the reading frame is not shifted. This is an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another substituted (Leucine to Tyrosine). This is less likely to completely abolish protein function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating the function of a protein is the one that prevents a full-length, functional version from being made. The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop signal at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is the most probable option to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the genetic mutations in each mutant line and determine which one is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional protein is most reliably produced by a mutation that severely disrupts the gene's reading frame or introduces a premature stop codon.\n\nLet's break down the DNA sequence into codons (three-base units) and translate them into amino acids for the intact gene and each mutant. The standard genetic code will be used for translation. The gene starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene Sequence:**\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp - Glu - His - Ile - Tyr - Cys - Arg...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes one amino acid.\n*   **Effect:** A single amino acid change might or might not inactivate the protein. Its function could be reduced, altered, or unaffected. It is not the most certain way to eliminate function.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. This is a silent mutation (Phe).\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAA`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. The translation will terminate after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This truncated protein will be non-functional. This is the most likely mutation to completely eliminate the synthesis of the target compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. Missense mutation (Leu -> Tyr).\n    *   Codon 6: `ACT` -> `GTC`. `ACT` codes for Threonine (Thr), while `GTC` codes for Valine (Val). This is another **missense mutation**.\n*   **Effect:** This mutant has two amino acid changes. While this increases the chance of disrupting the protein's function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon. The protein is still fully translated.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact: The mutant sequence is shorter.\n    *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` (Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...)\n    *   Mutant: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` (Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...)\n    *   The sequence `CTC GCT GGT` (coding for Leu-Ala-Gly) in the intact gene has been effectively changed to `TAC GCT` (coding for Tyr-Ala), and the reading frame continues from there. This represents a combination of a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of one codon (`GGT`).\n*   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (deletion of 3 bases) combined with a missense mutation. The protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another changed (Leu to Tyr), but the rest of the protein will be translated correctly. This might inactivate the protein, but like missense mutations, the outcome is not as certain as a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating a protein's function is the one that causes the most severe disruption. A nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a severely truncated and guaranteed non-functional protein. The other mutations (missense and in-frame deletion) result in a full-length or near-full-length protein with one or two amino acid changes, which may or may not be sufficient to eliminate its function. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable candidate to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the most effective mutation:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by a specific gene. To stop the compound's synthesis, we need to disrupt the gene so that it no longer produces a functional protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Gene:** The intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`, which is the universal start codon (Methionine). It ends with `...TGA-3’`, which is one of the three stop codons. The protein synthesis starts at `ATG` and continues until a stop codon is reached.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Types of Mutations:**\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. This *might* disrupt protein function, especially if the change occurs in a critical region, but it could also have little to no effect.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a premature stop codon. This truncates the protein, and if it occurs early in the sequence, it almost always results in a non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation (Insertion/Deletion):** The insertion or deletion of nucleotides (not in a multiple of three). This shifts the reading frame, changing every subsequent amino acid. This typically leads to a completely different and non-functional protein, often encountering a premature stop codon in the new frame.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Mutant Sequence:** We will break down each DNA sequence into three-letter codons and translate them into amino acids to see the effect of the mutation. The genetic code will be used for translation (`_` represents a stop codon).\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...`\n        *   This is our baseline for a functional protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Thr ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes a single amino acid. This might not be enough to completely inactivate the protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - STOP`\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA` (a stop codon). This is a **nonsense mutation**. Translation will stop after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This peptide will almost certainly be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val). These are two **missense mutations**. While two changes are more disruptive than one, it is still not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Thr - Ser ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence also contains two changes: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `GGT` (Gly) -> `ACT` (Thr). These are two **missense mutations**. Again, this is not as certain to eliminate function as a premature stop codon.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most effective way to ensure a gene is knocked out is to prevent the synthesis of a full-length protein. Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is the most drastic and definitive change among the options, making it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify the mutation that is most likely to create a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein is most reliably produced by a mutation that causes a major disruption, such as a premature stop to protein synthesis.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in three-base-pair units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene (Control)**\n*   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\n*   **Codons:** `ATG` (Methionine/Start), `TTT` (Phenylalanine), `CTC` (Leucine), `GCT` (Alanine), `GGT` (Glycine)\n*   **Protein Sequence:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...\nThis is the functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n**Analysis of Mutants**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n    *   **Effect:**\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation** with no effect on the protein.\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine): This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another.

The `TAA` codon is a stop codon, which signals the ribosome to terminate protein synthesis.\n    *   **Result:** Protein synthesis will stop after only two amino acids have been joined. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional. This mutation will almost certainly eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val).

This is an **in-frame deletion** because a full codon (3 bases) is removed, which deletes an amino acid without shifting the reading frame. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid and have another changed. This is a significant alteration but does not guarantee complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe because it introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene. This will halt protein synthesis, resulting in a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most reliable way to \"knock out\" the gene's function among the choices provided.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional protein is most reliably created by a mutation that causes a major disruption to the protein's structure, such as stopping its synthesis prematurely.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.

This is the functional protein.\n\n**2. Mutant 1 Analysis**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT`... -3’\n*   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). Note that the second codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`, but both code for Phenylalanine, so this is a silent mutation.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly...\n*   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. While this might affect the protein's function, it does not guarantee it will be non-functional. The protein is still produced at its full length.\n\n**3.

When the ribosome encounters this codon, it terminates translation. This results in a severely truncated protein containing only two amino acids. Such a short peptide is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n**4. Mutant 3 Analysis**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`... -3’\n*   **Change:** Two changes are present.

The protein is still produced at full length but with two amino acid substitutions. This is more likely to disrupt function than a single missense mutation, but it is still less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n**5. Mutant 4 Analysis**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`... -3’\n*   **Change:** Comparing to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), we see that the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...\n*   **Effect:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** (Leu -> Tyr) and an **in-frame deletion** (the Glycine codon `GGT` is removed). Because three bases (one full codon) were removed, the reading frame is not shifted. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another amino acid changed. This alters the protein, but like a missense mutation, it doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most drastic and reliable way to eliminate a protein's function among the given options is to introduce a premature stop codon, as seen in Mutant 2.

The `TAA` codon is a stop codon, which signals the cell to terminate protein synthesis prematurely. This results in a severely shortened and almost certainly non-functional protein. This type of mutation is highly likely to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... -3’`\n    *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). While multiple amino acid changes increase the chance of disrupting the protein, it is less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ... -3’`\n    *   This sequence also has two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `GGT` (Glycine) becomes `ACT` (Threonine). Similar to Mutant 3, this may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 is the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound because the introduction of a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) early in the gene sequence will halt protein production, leading to a truncated and non-functional protein.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the protein's structure and function. The most effective way to achieve this is by introducing a premature stop codon or a frameshift mutation early in the gene sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the genetic sequence of the intact gene and each mutant. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, with each codon corresponding to a specific amino acid or a stop signal. Translation starts at the `ATG` codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence and Protein:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine - Threonine...\n\nNow, let's examine the effect of each mutation:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this could alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein will be extremely short (only two amino acids long) and almost certainly non-functional. This is the most probable mutation to completely eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence shows multiple single-base substitutions compared to the original, resulting in several amino acid changes (e.g., Leucine to Tyrosine, Threonine to Valine). These are multiple **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this will alter the protein, but complete loss of function is less certain than with a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence also contains multiple **missense mutations** (e.g., Leucine to Tyrosine, Glycine to Threonine). Like the other missense mutations, the effect is not as predictably severe as a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the protein-coding sequence. This nonsense mutation will lead to a severely truncated and non-functional protein, making it the most likely candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
