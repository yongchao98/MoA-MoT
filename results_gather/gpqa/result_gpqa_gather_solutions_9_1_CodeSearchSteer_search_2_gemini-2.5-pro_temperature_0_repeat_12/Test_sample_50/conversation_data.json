The Method of Images**\n\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field outside the grounded conducting sphere is identical to the field produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the origin. For the potential to be zero on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`), the image charge `q'` must be:\n\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** Located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nSo, we have a simplified system of two point charges:\n*   The real charge `q` at distance `d` from the origin.\n*   The image charge `q' = -qR/d` at distance `b = R^2/d` from the origin.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force acting on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to assemble the system, which is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n`U = W_ext = -W_field = -∫_∞^d F_elec ⋅ dr`\n\nThe force on charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force from its image at that moment:\n*   Image charge at `x`: `q'(x) = -qR/x`\n*   Image position at `x`: `b(x) = R^2/x`\n*   Force `F_elec(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n    `F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the work done by the field:\n`W_field = ∫_∞^d F_elec(x) dx = ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nLet `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`W_field = -k * q^2 * R * ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (-k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]`\n`W_field = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [1 / (x^2 - R^2)]_∞^d`\n`W_field = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [1 / (d^2 - R^2) - 1/∞] = k * q^2 * R / (2(d^2 - R^2))`\n\nThe potential energy is `U = -W_field`.\n`U = -k * q^2 * R / (2(d^2 - R^2))`\n\n**Method B: Using Potential**\n\nThe potential energy of a system of charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) ∑ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\nIn our system, we have the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * [q * V_induced_at_q + Q_sphere * V_sphere]`\n\nSince the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0. So the second term is zero.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced_at_q`\n\n`V_induced_at_q` is the potential at the location of `q` (distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. This is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\nThe distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is:\n`distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n\nThe potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n`V_induced_at_q = k * q' / (distance) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe problem of calculating the potential energy of a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic electrostatics problem that can be solved using the method of image charges.\n\nHere's a step-by-step derivation of the potential energy:\n\n1.  **Method of Image Charges**: The electric field outside the grounded conducting sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image\" charge. This image charge is positioned such that the potential on the surface of the sphere remains zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and its Position**: For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   It is located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of the charge `q` is half of the interaction energy between the charge `q` and its image `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the energy is stored in the electric field, and simply calculating the interaction potential `q * V_image` would double-count the energy. The work done on the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`, where `V_image` is the potential at the location of `q` due to the image charge.\n\n4.  **Derivation of the Formula**:\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_image = k * (-R/d * q) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   The potential energy of the system is:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we will use the method of images, a powerful technique in electrostatics for problems involving charges and conductors.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). Since the sphere is a conductor, the charge `q` will induce an opposite charge on the surface of the sphere. The sphere being \"grounded\" means its potential is held at zero.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** To find the potential and field outside the sphere, we can replace the sphere with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original charge `q`, must create a potential of zero on the surface that was once the sphere (at radius `r=R`).\n\n3.  **Image Charge and Position:** For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by:\n    *   `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\n4.  **Calculating Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere. The potential energy `U` is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charge on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge (the source of the potential) is itself created by the presence of `q`.\n\n5.  **Potential from Image Charge:** The potential `V_induced` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`. The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n6.  **Substitution and Simplification:** Now, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    *   `V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Final Energy Calculation:** Finally, we calculate the potential energy `U`:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result matches option C. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\nThe following Python code will select and print the correct choice from the given options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_potential_energy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the correct formula for the potential energy of a charge\n    near a grounded conducting sphere and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system with a charge q\n    # at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R.\n\n    # Based on the method of images in electrostatics, the potential energy U is derived as:\n    # U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)\n    # where k is Coulomb's constant.\n\n    # Let's define the given options.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\",\n        \"B\": \"U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\",\n        \"C\": \"U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\",\n        \"D\": \"U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\"\n    }\n\n    # The derived correct formula corresponds to option C.\n    correct_choice_key = \"C\"\n    correct_choice_formula = options[correct_choice_key]\n\n    # Print the final answer.\n    print(f\"The correct option is: {correct_choice_key}\")\n    print(f\"The formula for the net potential energy is: {correct_choice_formula}\")\n\nsolve_potential_energy_problem()\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The correct option is: C\nThe formula for the net potential energy is: U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    *   We have a point charge `q`.\n    *   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n    *   The point charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere. We assume `d > R`, meaning the charge is outside the sphere.\n    *   We need to find the total potential energy `U` of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Method: The Method of Images**\n    *   This problem involves a charge and a conductor with a simple geometry (a sphere). Such problems are most easily solved using the **method of images**.\n    *   The method of images states that the electric field and potential *outside* the conducting sphere can be perfectly replicated by removing the sphere and placing a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the sphere.\n    *   The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition, which in this case is that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Location**\n    *   For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n        *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   Image charge location: `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   **Careful Point:** The image charge is located along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. Since `d > R`, it follows that `b < R`, so the image charge is correctly located *inside* the original sphere's volume. The negative sign of `q'` indicates that the force between the real charge and the sphere is attractive.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy**\n    *   The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n    *   A more direct way to calculate this energy is to consider the interaction energy. The potential energy `U` of a charge `q` in the presence of other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere) is given by:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   **Careful Point:** The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution on the sphere is itself created by the presence of `q`. As `q` is brought from infinity, the induced charge builds up, and the work done is half of what it would be if the induced charge were a fixed, pre-existing charge distribution.\n    *   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n    *   According to the method of images, this potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n\n5.  **Calculate `V_induced`**\n    *   The potential at distance `d` from the center due to the image charge `q'` at distance `b` from the center is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-qR/d] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`**\n    *   Now substitute the expression for `V_induced` into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Final Check**\n    *   The result is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   The energy is negative, which is correct for an attractive force.\n    *   The units are correct (`k*q^2/distance`).\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect\n        B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\n        C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\n        D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\n\nThe final answer is derived from a standard application of the method of images and the formula for potential energy in the presence of an induced charge distribution.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential. We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem can be simplified using the method of images. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced surface charges on the sphere, are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere. The real induced charges on the sphere's surface are replaced by this fictitious image charge for the purpose of calculation outside the sphere.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   For the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) to be zero, the image charge `q'` must be placed at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n    *   Through standard derivation (by ensuring the potential is zero at points on the sphere), the properties of the image charge are found to be:\n        *   Position of image charge: `b = R^2 / d`\n        *   Magnitude of image charge: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` is brought closer, the induced charge on the sphere (and thus the image charge) changes.\n\n    A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the final image charge `q'` as `U = k*q*q'/(d-b)`. This is incorrect because the image charge `q'` is not a fixed charge; its magnitude and position depend on the location of `q`.\n\n    The correct way to calculate the energy is using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the final position of the charge `q` created by all other charges in the system (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 accounts for the fact that the induced charges are themselves created by `q`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Potential at the location of q:**\n    *   The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` (a distance `d` from the center) due to the induced surface charge is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        *   `q' = -qR/d`\n        *   `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    *   `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U):**\n    *   Now use the correct energy formula: `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (has R²)\n    *   B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (missing 1/2, has d instead of R)\n    *   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect (wrong sign in denominator, has d instead of R)\n    *   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\n\nThe derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo solve this problem, we use the method of images. The grounded conducting sphere can be replaced by an \"image\" charge, which, together with the original charge `q`, reproduces the correct potential (zero) on the surface of the sphere.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the sphere can be replaced by an image charge `q'` at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`. The values for the image charge and its position are:\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n2.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the attractive force between the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere. This force is equivalent to the force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n        The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by its image:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\n        The image charge at that point is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`. The distance between them is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n        The work done is the integral of this force from infinity to `d`.\n        `U = W = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n        Performing this integration yields:\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using Potential `U = (1/2)qV`**\n        A more direct method is to use the formula for the energy of a charge in the presence of a conductor. The potential energy is half the product of the charge and the potential at its location created by the induced charges. The potential created by the induced charges is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n        The potential at the location of `q` (distance `d`) due to the image charge `q'` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n        The potential energy is then:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, which corresponds to option A.

The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. We need to find the total potential energy of this entire system (the charge `q` plus the sphere with its induced charges).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** This is a classic electrostatics problem that is best solved using the \"method of images.\" The principle is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" placed inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original charge `q`, must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   Let the image charge be `q'` located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n    *   For the potential to be zero at any point on the sphere's surface (a distance `R` from the center), the image charge must be:\n        *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   And its position must be: `b = R^2/d`\n    *   With this image charge `q'` at position `b`, the potential created by `q` and `q'` on the surface of the sphere is indeed zero. Therefore, for any point outside the sphere, the electric field and potential are correctly described by the combination of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy (U):**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to simply calculate the interaction energy between `q` and `q'`. The correct formula for the energy of a system of conductors and charges is `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n    *   In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the charge on the sphere.\n    *   The potential of the sphere is `V_sphere = 0` (it's grounded).\n    *   The potential at the location of the charge `q` is the sum of its own potential (which we don't count in the interaction energy) and the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere, let's call this `V_induced`.\n    *   The formula for the total energy simplifies to `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The term for the sphere is `(1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`, which is zero.\n\n5.  **Finding V_induced:**\n    *   The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` (distance `d` from the center) is, by the method of images, the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n    *   So, the potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        where `k = 1/(4πε₀)`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - R^2/d]`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation of Energy (U):**\n    *   Now, substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into our energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, and the system has lower energy than when the charge is at infinity (where U=0).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n\nWhen the charge `q` is brought near the sphere, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. These induced charges redistribute themselves in such a way that the net potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. Calculating the potential energy directly from this surface charge distribution (`sigma`) is complicated.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nA powerful technique to solve this type of problem is the \"method of images.\" We can replace the grounded sphere and its complex induced surface charge with a single, imaginary point charge (an \"image charge\") inside the sphere. This setup must replicate the boundary condition, which is V = 0 on the surface of the sphere.\n\nLet's find the magnitude and position of this image charge, which we'll call `q'`.\n\n*   **Position of Image Charge (`b`):** The image charge `q'` must lie on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the external charge `q`. Let its distance from the center be `b`.\n*   **Magnitude of Image Charge (`q'`):** For the potential to be zero everywhere on the sphere's surface (at radius `R`), the image charge and its position are found to be:\n    *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\nNow, the system of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` perfectly reproduces the electric field *outside* the sphere. The potential on the surface of the sphere due to these two charges is zero, satisfying the boundary condition.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As we bring `q` closer, it moves in the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere. The potential created by these induced charges at the location of `q` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe force on the charge `q` is the electrostatic force between `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n*   The force is `F = k * q * q' / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`.\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to `d`, which is the integral of the force.\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\nThis integration is possible but can be complex.\n\n**Method B: Using Potential (Simpler)**\n\nA more direct formula for the interaction energy `U` between a charge `q` and a grounded conductor is:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nWhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. As established, this is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n1.  **Calculate `V_induced` at the position of `q`:**\n    The potential at distance `d` from the center (the location of `q`) due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   distance = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n\n    Substituting these in:\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Potential Energy `U`:**\n    Now, we use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*(Note: The factor of 1/2 is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution is not independent; its existence and magnitude depend on the presence of `q`. We are calculating the energy to build the entire system, not just placing a charge in a pre-existing field.)*\n\n### 4.

The grounded sphere itself is at zero potential. The image charge is positioned and sized such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by:\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n3.  **Calculating the Force**: The force on the real charge `q` is the electrostatic force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere's surface. In the image method, this is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    The force is:\n    `F = k * q * q' / (d - b)^2`\n    Substituting the values for `q'` and `b`:\n    `F = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)^2`\n    `F = -k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`\n    This is the force on the charge `q` when it is at the specific distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**: The potential energy (U) of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the sphere's center. This work is the integral of the force along the path.\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n    Here, `x` is the variable distance from the center. The force as a function of `x` is `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n5.  **Solving the Integral**: We can solve this integral using a u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`.\n    The integral becomes:\n    `∫ (1/2) * du / u^2 = -1 / (2u)`\n    Substituting back `u = x^2 - R^2`:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [1/(d^2 - R^2) - 1/(∞^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Alternative Explanation (Factor of 1/2)**: The potential energy of a charge `q` in an external potential `V` is `U = qV`. However, in this case, the potential from the induced charge is not independent of `q`; it is created by `q`. The work done in building up the charge from 0 to `q` at position `d` introduces a factor of 1/2. The potential at `d` due to the image charge is `V_image = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`. The total potential energy is `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)] = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

The force acting on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to assemble the system, which is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n`U = W_ext = -W_field = -∫_∞^d F_elec ⋅ dr`\n\nThe force on charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force from its image at that moment:\n*   Image charge at `x`: `q'(x) = -qR/x`\n*   Image position at `x`: `b(x) = R^2/x`\n*   Force `F_elec(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n    `F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the work done by the field:\n`W_field = ∫_∞^d F_elec(x) dx = ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nLet `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`W_field = -k * q^2 * R * ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (-k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]`\n`W_field = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [1 / (x^2 - R^2)]_∞^d`\n`W_field = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [1 / (d^2 - R^2) - 1/∞] = k * q^2 * R / (2(d^2 - R^2))`\n\nThe potential energy is `U = -W_field`.\n`U = -k * q^2 * R / (2(d^2 - R^2))`\n\n**Method B: Using Potential**\n\nThe potential energy of a system of charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) ∑ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\nIn our system, we have the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * [q * V_induced_at_q + Q_sphere * V_sphere]`\n\nSince the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0.

Since the sphere is a conductor, the charge `q` will induce an opposite charge on the surface of the sphere. The sphere being \"grounded\" means its potential is held at zero.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** To find the potential and field outside the sphere, we can replace the sphere with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original charge `q`, must create a potential of zero on the surface that was once the sphere (at radius `r=R`).\n\n3.  **Image Charge and Position:** For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by:\n    *   `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\n4.  **Calculating Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere. The potential energy `U` is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charge on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge (the source of the potential) is itself created by the presence of `q`.\n\n5.  **Potential from Image Charge:** The potential `V_induced` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`. The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n6.  **Substitution and Simplification:** Now, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    *   `V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Final Energy Calculation:** Finally, we calculate the potential energy `U`:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result matches option C.

The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential. We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem can be simplified using the method of images. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced surface charges on the sphere, are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere.

As the charge `q` is brought closer, the induced charge on the sphere (and thus the image charge) changes.\n\n    A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the final image charge `q'` as `U = k*q*q'/(d-b)`. This is incorrect because the image charge `q'` is not a fixed charge; its magnitude and position depend on the location of `q`.\n\n    The correct way to calculate the energy is using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the final position of the charge `q` created by all other charges in the system (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).

This work is done against the attractive force between the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere. This force is equivalent to the force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n        The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by its image:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\n        The image charge at that point is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`.

The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and this image charge.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Image Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is defined as follows:\n\n*   **Magnitude of image charge (`q'`):** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position of image charge (`d'`):** It is located at a distance `d' = R^2 / d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nThis specific choice of `q'` and `d'` ensures that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero, satisfying the condition for a grounded sphere.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A simpler way to calculate this is to find the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and its image `q'`.\n\nHowever, a crucial point in the method of images is that the potential energy of the system is **one-half** of the interaction energy between the real charge and its image. The factor of 1/2 arises because the image charge is not a fixed, independent charge; it is an induced charge whose existence and magnitude depend on the real charge.\n\n1.  **Calculate the interaction energy (`U_int`) between `q` and `q'`:**\n    The interaction energy is given by Coulomb's potential energy formula:\n    `U_int = k * (q * q') / (distance between them)`\n\n    *   The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `d'`) is:\n        `distance = d - d' = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    *   Now, substitute the values into the interaction energy formula:\n        `U_int = k * q * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n\n    *   The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancel out:\n        `U_int = - k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the net potential energy of the system (`U`):**\n    The net potential energy of the system is half of the interaction energy.\n    `U = (1/2) * U_int`\n    `U = (1/2) * [- k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 3: Compare with Options\n\nLet's compare our result with the given choices:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur calculated potential energy, `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this V=0 condition. We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem is a classic example where the method of images is used. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the complex distribution of induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be perfectly replicated by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" placed inside the sphere. The potential on the surface of the sphere due to the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must sum to zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The real charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the origin.\n    *   Let the image charge be `q'` at a distance `b` from the origin, along the same line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n    *   The potential `V` at any point on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) must be zero.\n    *   `V_surface = V_q + V_q' = 0`\n    *   Through standard derivation (by ensuring the potential is zero on the surface), the image charge `q'` and its position `b` are found to be:\n        *   Image charge magnitude and sign: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Note that since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), we have `|q'| < |q|` and `b < R` (the image charge is inside the sphere).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy (U):**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` is brought in, it induces the charge distribution on the sphere.\n    The energy of a charge `q` in the presence of other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere) is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by all other charges. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge distribution is created by `q` itself.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Induced Potential (V_induced):**\n    The potential at the location of `q` (distance `d` from the center) due to the induced charges on the sphere is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    *   The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancel out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U):**\n    Now, use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    C) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\n    Our derived result matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the net potential energy of a charge `q` placed a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, we can use the method of images. This method simplifies the problem by replacing the complex charge distribution induced on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\".\n\nHere's a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the induced charge on the sphere's surface creates an electric field outside the sphere that is identical to the field of an image charge `q'`. This image charge is located at a distance `d'` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = - (R/d) * q`.\n    *   The position of the image charge is `d' = R^2 / d`.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere (which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge).\n\n    The force on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is due to the image charge `q' = -Rq/x` at a distance `x' = R^2/x`. The distance between them is `x - x'`.\n    The force is `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - x')^2 = k * q * (-Rq/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * R * q^2 * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to `d`:\n    `U = - ∫[∞ to d] F(x) dx = ∫[d to ∞] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[d to ∞] -k * R * q^2 * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n    To solve this integral, we can use a substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`.\n    `U = -k * R * q^2 * (1/2) ∫[d^2-R^2 to ∞] du / u^2`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * R * q^2 * [-1/u] from (d^2 - R^2) to ∞`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * R * q^2 * [0 - (-1 / (d^2 - R^2))]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    An alternative and simpler way to think about this is that the potential energy of the system is half the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The interaction energy is `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (d - d')`.\n\n    Let's calculate this:\n    *   `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n    *   `U_interaction = k * q * (-Rq/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   The net potential energy is `U = (1/2) * U_interaction = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo calculate the net potential energy of a system where a charge *q* is placed a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R*, we can use the method of images.\n\n1.  **The Method of Images**: This technique simplifies the problem by replacing the grounded sphere with an \"image charge\" (*q'*) inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original charge *q*, reproduces the zero potential on the surface of the sphere.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and its Position**:\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n    *   It is located at a distance `d' = R²/d` from the center of the sphere, on the line connecting the center and the charge *q*.\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to the distance *d*. A common mistake is to simply calculate the interaction energy between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'*. The correct potential energy of the system is half of the interaction energy between the real charge and its image charge. This factor of 1/2 accounts for the self-energy of the induced charge on the sphere's surface.\n\n4.  **Interaction Energy Calculation**:\n    *   The distance between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'* is `d - d' = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    *   The interaction energy (*U_interaction*) between *q* and *q'* is given by Coulomb's law:\n        `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (d - d')`\n        Substituting the values for *q'* and *(d - d')*:\n        `U_interaction = k * q * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n        `U_interaction = - (k * q² * R) / (d² - R²)`\n\n5.  **Net Potential Energy of the System**:\n    *   As established, the net potential energy (*U*) is half of this interaction energy:\n        `U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n        `U = (1/2) * [- (k * q² * R) / (d² - R²)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe problem of calculating the potential energy of a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic application of the method of images in electrostatics.\n\nHere's a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Method of Images**: The electric field and potential outside the grounded sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with a single \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The grounded sphere itself is at zero potential. The image charge is positioned and sized such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by:\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n3.  **Calculating the Force**: The force on the real charge `q` is the electrostatic force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere's surface. In the image method, this is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    The force is:\n    `F = k * q * q' / (d - b)^2`\n    Substituting the values for `q'` and `b`:\n    `F = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)^2`\n    `F = -k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`\n    This is the force on the charge `q` when it is at the specific distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**: The potential energy (U) of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the sphere's center. This work is the integral of the force along the path.\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n    Here, `x` is the variable distance from the center. The force as a function of `x` is `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n5.  **Solving the Integral**: We can solve this integral using a u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`.\n    The integral becomes:\n    `∫ (1/2) * du / u^2 = -1 / (2u)`\n    Substituting back `u = x^2 - R^2`:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [1/(d^2 - R^2) - 1/(∞^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Alternative Explanation (Factor of 1/2)**: The potential energy of a charge `q` in an external potential `V` is `U = qV`. However, in this case, the potential from the induced charge is not independent of `q`; it is created by `q`. The work done in building up the charge from 0 to `q` at position `d` introduces a factor of 1/2. The potential at `d` due to the image charge is `V_image = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`. The total potential energy is `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)] = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
