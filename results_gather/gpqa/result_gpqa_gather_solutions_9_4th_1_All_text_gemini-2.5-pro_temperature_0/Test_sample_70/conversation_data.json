The core reasoning, however, is sound and consistent across all analyses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Laws:** The solution requires combining two fundamental principles:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, $a$). This is because the incoming energy flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance ($1/a^2$), and temperature is proportional to the fourth root of the energy flux.\n        $T_{eq} \\propto (1/a^2)^{1/4} \\implies T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$).\n        $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n2.  **Derive the Relationship between Temperature and Period:** The goal is to find a direct relationship between temperature and period. We can do this by substituting one law into the other.\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law, we can express the distance in terms of the period: $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n    *   Substitute this into the equilibrium temperature relationship: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$.\n    *   Using the rule of exponents, $(x^m)^n = x^{m \\times n}$, we simplify the expression: $T_{eq} \\propto P^{(2/3) \\times (-1/2)} \\implies T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n    *   This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Formulate and Calculate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$).\n    *   Using the relationship from Step 2: $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{P_4^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_4}{P_2})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$.\n    *   From the given period ratios (1:2:2.5:3.5:5), we have $P_2 = 2$ and $P_4 = 3.5$.\n    *   Substitute these values into the formula: $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3} = (\\frac{4}{7})^{1/3}$.\n    *   Performing the calculation: $(4/7)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately **0.83**.

These conditions allow for the cancellation of other variables in the full equilibrium temperature equation.\n*   **Exponent Arithmetic:** The core of the derivation is the correct multiplication of exponents to combine the two physical laws, resulting in the final power of -1/3 for the period.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** It is critical to note that the temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ is related to the *inverse* period ratio $P_2/P_4$. A common mistake would be to calculate $(P_4/P_2)^{1/3}$.\n*   **Intermediate vs. Final Value:** The ratio of the periods, $P_2/P_4$, is approximately 0.57. This value is listed as option B and is a potential trap. One must remember to take the cube root of this value to get the final temperature ratio.\n*   **Contextual Information:** The details about the TTV discovery method and orbital resonance are scientifically interesting context but are not required for the mathematical calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the mathematical derivation, and the final numerical result.

All candidate answers agree on the method, which involves combining the equilibrium temperature formula with Kepler's Third Law. The only discrepancy is the final letter choice, which is due to shuffled options. I will perform the calculation myself and match it to the specific list of options provided in the user's question.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Identify Physical Laws:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is proportional to the inverse square root of the orbital distance ($a$), so $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$. Kepler's Third Law states that the orbital period squared ($P^2$) is proportional to the orbital distance cubed ($a^3$), which means $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n2.  **Combine Laws:** By substituting the expression for distance from Kepler's Law into the temperature relation, we find that temperature is proportional to the inverse cube root of the period: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2} = P^{-1/3}$.\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** The ratio of the temperature of Planet 4 to Planet 2 is therefore $T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2} = (P_4/P_2)^{-1/3} = (P_2/P_4)^{1/3}$.\n4.  **Calculate:** Use the given period values for Planet 2 ($P_2 = 2$) and Planet 4 ($P_4 = 3.5$) to compute the final numerical ratio.\n5.  **Select the Answer:** Compare the calculated result to the given multiple-choice options in the main question to determine the correct choice.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Key Assumptions:** The calculation relies on the problem stating the planets orbit the **same star** and have the **same albedo**. This allows for the cancellation of other factors in the equilibrium temperature formula.\n*   **Exponent Arithmetic:** The derivation hinges on correctly combining the exponents from the two physical laws to arrive at the final relationship $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** It is crucial to correctly formulate the final ratio. The temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ is equal to the period ratio $(P_2/P_4)^{1/3}$, with the indices inverted. A common mistake is to use $P_4/P_2$.\n*   **Intermediate vs. Final Answer:** The ratio of the periods, $P_2 / P_4$, is approximately 0.57.

Kepler's Third Law states that the orbital period squared ($P^2$) is proportional to the orbital distance cubed ($a^3$), which means $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n2.  **Combine Laws:** By substituting the expression for distance from Kepler's Law into the temperature relation, we find that temperature is proportional to the inverse cube root of the period: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2} = P^{-1/3}$.\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** The ratio of the temperature of Planet 4 to Planet 2 is therefore $T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2} = (P_4/P_2)^{-1/3} = (P_2/P_4)^{1/3}$.\n4.  **Calculate:** Use the given period values for Planet 2 ($P_2 = 2$) and Planet 4 ($P_4 = 3.5$) to compute the final numerical ratio.\n5.  **Select the Answer:** Compare the calculated result to the given multiple-choice options in the main question to determine the correct choice.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Key Assumptions:** The calculation relies on the problem stating the planets orbit the **same star** and have the **same albedo**. This allows for the cancellation of other factors in the equilibrium temperature formula.\n*   **Exponent Arithmetic:** The derivation hinges on correctly combining the exponents from the two physical laws to arrive at the final relationship $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** It is crucial to correctly formulate the final ratio. The temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ is equal to the period ratio $(P_2/P_4)^{1/3}$, with the indices inverted. A common mistake is to use $P_4/P_2$.\n*   **Intermediate vs. Final Answer:** The ratio of the periods, $P_2 / P_4$, is approximately 0.57. This value is listed as an option and could be a potential trap.

This is achieved by combining the two principles.\n    *   From Kepler's Law, we can express the semi-major axis `a` in terms of the period `P`:\n        $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n    *   Now, substitute this expression for `a` into the equilibrium temperature relationship:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n    *   Using the rule of exponents $(x^m)^n = x^{m \\times n}$, we multiply the exponents:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto P^{(2/3) \\times (-1/2)} = P^{-1/3}$\n    *   This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Specific Ratio:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$).\n    *   Using the relationship from the previous step:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{P_4^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_4}{P_2})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   The relative period for Planet_2 is $P_2 = 2$.\n    *   The relative period for Planet_4 is $P_4 = 3.5$.\n    *   The ratio of their periods is $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5} = \\frac{4}{7}$.\n    *   Now, we calculate the final temperature ratio:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = (\\frac{4}{7})^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio, rounded to two decimal places, is **0.83**. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) ~0.57\n    *   B) ~0.75\n    *   C) ~0.83\n    *   D) ~0.69\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Key Assumptions:** The entire calculation relies on the problem stating the planets orbit the **same star** and have the **same albedo**. These conditions allow all other factors in the full equilibrium temperature equation to cancel out.\n*   **Exponent Arithmetic:** The derivation hinges on correctly multiplying the exponents: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$. An error here would fundamentally change the result.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** It is crucial to note that the temperature ratio ($T_4/T_2$) is related to the *inverse* period ratio ($P_2/P_4$) raised to a positive power. A common mistake is to use ($P_4/P_2$).\n*   **Intermediate vs. Final Value:** The intermediate calculation of the period ratio is $P_2/P_4 \\approx 0.57$. It is important not to confuse this with the final answer. This value is listed as option A, representing a potential trap for those who forget the final step.\n*   **Contextual Information:** The details about the TTV discovery method and orbital resonance confirm that the system behaves according to standard orbital mechanics, but they are not directly used in the calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
