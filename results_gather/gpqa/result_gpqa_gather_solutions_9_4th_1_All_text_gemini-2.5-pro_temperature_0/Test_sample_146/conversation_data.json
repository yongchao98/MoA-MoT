The discrepancies in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) stem from the fact that the options were presented in a different order to each agent. The core calculation, however, is consistent and robust across all analyses.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Governing Principles:** The problem involves a particle-antiparticle annihilation, a process governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the process involves the conversion of mass to energy and results in high-speed particles, the framework of special relativity must be used.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The phrase \"slowly moving\" indicates that the initial kinetic energy of the particles is negligible compared to their rest energy. We can therefore analyze the annihilation as occurring \"at rest\" in the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. A particle and its antiparticle have identical mass.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is a known physical constant, approximately 938.3 MeV.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Determine Final State Energy Distribution:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All have the same given rest energy, $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Since the initial momentum of the system is zero, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. Due to this symmetry, the initial energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles.\n    *   The energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is therefore one-quarter of the total initial energy.\n    *   $E_A = \\frac{E_{initial}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity of Particle A:**\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by the formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the equation $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can rearrange this to solve for the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$.\n    *   $\\beta \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n    *   Comparing this result to the options provided in the original question:\n        A) 0.77c\n        B) 0.86c\n        C) 0.96c\n        D) 0.91c\n    *   The calculated value of 0.77c directly matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **\"Slowly Moving\" Approximation:** This is a critical simplification that allows us to set the initial kinetic energy to zero and use only the rest energies for the initial state.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The kinetic energy of the final particles ($469.15 - 300 = 169.15$ MeV) is a significant fraction of their rest energy (300 MeV), confirming that relativistic formulas are essential.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum and Symmetry:** This principle is the justification for distributing the total energy equally among the four identical final particles.\n*   **Option Scrambling:** The analysis of the candidate answers shows that the calculation of the value 0.77c is highly reliable. The main source of confusion was the inconsistent ordering of the multiple-choice options. The final decision must be based on matching the correct calculation to the options as presented in the original question.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn analysis of the 15 candidate answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the calculation method, and the final numerical result. Every single analysis correctly determines the velocity of particle A to be approximately 0.77c. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) across the different answers are due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent.

All have the same given rest energy, $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Since the initial momentum of the system is zero, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. Due to this symmetry, the initial energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles.\n    *   The energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is therefore one-quarter of the total initial energy.\n    *   $E_A = \\frac{E_{initial}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity of Particle A:**\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by the formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the equation $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.
