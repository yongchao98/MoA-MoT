A standard E2 elimination to form a double bond at a bridgehead carbon is forbidden by Bredt's rule. The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) strongly suggest a skeletal rearrangement rather than a simple substitution or elimination.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Analyzing the Spectroscopic Data.** The provided data is definitive. The IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O). The ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is characteristic of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂). The total proton count of 14 implies a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Conclusion:** The only reaction that opens the adamantane cage and produces a bicyclic product consistent with all the spectral data is a **Grob fragmentation**. The resulting structure is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Recognizing Reagent Selectivity.** This reaction is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. It is a highly chemoselective method for reducing ketones to alcohols and, crucially, does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Understanding Ozonolysis.** This is a standard **reductive ozonolysis**. This reaction cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone (=O) at position C7. The alcohol group at C3 remains unchanged.\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Careful Point 5: Identifying the Correct Proton.** The most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). The electronegative oxygen atom pulls electron density away, shifting this proton's signal significantly downfield (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm), more so than protons alpha to the ketone.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Recognizing Molecular Symmetry.** The final product, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7. This symmetry is essential for determining the coupling pattern.\n*   **Careful Point 7: Analyzing the Coupling Environment.**\n    *   The carbinol proton (H-C3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry, H-C3 is coupled to two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        1.  A pair of equivalent axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        2.  A pair of equivalent equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   The coupling constant to the axial-like pair (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-like pair (J_B).\n*   **Careful Point 8: Applying the n+1 Rule for Complex Splitting.** Since H-C3 is coupled to two different sets of equivalent protons, the n+1 rule is applied sequentially. Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**. Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2) into another **triplet**. The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical reasoning leads to the conclusion that the splitting pattern is a \"triplet of triplets\". Matching this with the provided options:\nA) triplet of triplets\nB) doublet of triplets\nC) pentet\nD) triplet\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem, highlighting the careful points required to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Interpreting the Reaction Conditions.** The starting material is a rigid, tricyclic cage. A standard elimination reaction to form a double bond at a bridgehead carbon is forbidden by Bredt's rule. The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) are known to induce skeletal rearrangements.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Analyzing the Spectroscopic Data.** This is the most critical part of deducing the first product.\n    *   The IR absorbance at **1720 cm⁻¹** is a clear indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR signal at **4.79 ppm (2H)** is definitive for vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n    *   The total proton count of 14 confirms the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** To accommodate a ketone, a double bond, and a C₁₀H₁₄O formula, the tricyclic adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic (two-ring) system. The only chemically plausible reaction that produces a product consistent with all the spectral data is a **Grob fragmentation**. The resulting structure is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Recognizing Reagent Selectivity.** This reaction is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. It is a highly selective method for reducing ketones to alcohols and, crucially, does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group.

The electronegative oxygen atom pulls electron density away from this proton, shifting its signal significantly downfield.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Recognizing Molecular Symmetry.** The final product, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7. This symmetry is essential for determining proton equivalence.\n*   **Careful Point 7: Analyzing the Coupling Environment.**\n    *   The carbinol proton (H-C3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Because of the plane of symmetry, H-C3 is coupled to two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        1.  A pair of equivalent axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        2.  A pair of equivalent equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   The coupling constant to the axial-like pair (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-like pair (J_B).\n*   **Conclusion on the Coupling Pattern:** According to the n+1 rule for complex splitting, the signal is split sequentially.

A standard elimination reaction to form a double bond at a bridgehead carbon is forbidden by Bredt's rule. The harsh conditions (strong base, high heat) are known to induce skeletal rearrangements.\n    *   **Careful Point - Spectroscopic Data:** The provided data is key to solving the structure.\n        *   The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ confirms the formation of a ketone (C=O).\n        *   The ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is a definitive indicator of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n        *   The total proton count of 14 (from C₁₀H₁₄O) means the adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic system to accommodate both a ketone and a double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The reaction is a Grob fragmentation. The structure that uniquely fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. All candidate answers that performed a detailed analysis correctly identified this structure.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n    *   **Careful Point - Reagent Selectivity:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to an alcohol. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**. This step was also correctly identified by all candidates.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n    *   **Careful Point - Ozonolysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) at C7 is converted into a ketone (=O). The alcohol at C3 remains unchanged.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**. This conclusion was also unanimous among the candidates.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n    *   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n    *   **Careful Point - Identifying the Proton:** In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the carbinol proton (H-C3), the hydrogen attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. The electronegativity of the oxygen atom shifts this proton significantly downfield.\n    *   **Careful Point - Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. This makes the two sides of the molecule equivalent and is crucial for determining the coupling pattern.\n    *   **Careful Point - Analyzing the Coupling Environment:**\n        *   The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂) groups, so there are four neighboring protons in total.\n        *   Due to the plane of symmetry, these four neighbors can be divided into two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n            1.  A set of two equivalent *axial-type* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n            2.  A set of two equivalent *equatorial-type* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   Since the coupling constant between H-C3 and the axial-type protons (J_ax) is different from the coupling constant with the equatorial-type protons (J_eq), the signal is split sequentially.\n    *   **Conclusion on Splitting Pattern:** Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) gives a triplet (n+1=3). Each line of this triplet is then split again by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2), resulting in another triplet. The final, observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical analysis from all valid candidate answers consistently leads to the final product **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.

The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ confirms the formation of a ketone (C=O). The ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is a definitive indicator of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂). The total proton count of 14 (implying a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O) means the adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic system to accommodate both a ketone and a double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The reaction is a Grob fragmentation, a known rearrangement for this system under these harsh conditions. The structure that uniquely fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to an alcohol. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) at C7 is converted into a ketone (=O). The alcohol at C3 remains unchanged.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n    *   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. In Product 3, this is the carbinol proton (H-C3), the hydrogen attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. The electronegativity of the oxygen atom shifts this proton significantly downfield.\n    *   **Analyze the Coupling Environment:**\n        *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. This makes the two sides of the molecule (the C1/C2/C9 side and the C5/C4/C8 side) equivalent.\n        *   **Neighbors:** The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂) groups, so there are four neighboring protons in total.\n        *   **Equivalence:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the four neighboring protons are not all equivalent to each other. They can be divided into two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n            1.  A set of two equivalent *axial-type* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n            2.  A set of two equivalent *equatorial-type* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Splitting Pattern:** Since the coupling constant between H-C3 and the axial-type protons (J_ax) is different from the coupling constant with the equatorial-type protons (J_eq), the signal is split sequentially. Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) gives a triplet (n+1=3). Each line of this triplet is then split again by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2), resulting in another triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical transformations consistently lead to bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. The analysis of its ¹H NMR spectrum shows that the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton (H-C3) is coupled to two different pairs of equivalent protons.

A pair of equivalent axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        2.  A pair of equivalent equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   The coupling constant to the axial-like pair (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-like pair (J_B).\n*   **Conclusion on the Coupling Pattern:** According to the n+1 rule, coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**.

A standard elimination reaction to form a double bond at a bridgehead carbon is forbidden by Bredt's rule. The harsh conditions (strong base, high heat) are known to induce skeletal rearrangements.\n    *   **Careful Point - Spectroscopic Data:** The provided data is key to solving the structure.\n        *   The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ confirms the formation of a ketone (C=O).\n        *   The ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is a definitive indicator of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n        *   The total proton count of 14 (from C₁₀H₁₄O) means the adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic system to accommodate both a ketone and a double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The reaction is a Grob fragmentation. The structure that uniquely fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. All candidate answers that performed a detailed analysis correctly identified this structure.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n    *   **Careful Point - Reagent Selectivity:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to an alcohol. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**. This step was also correctly identified by all candidates.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n    *   **Careful Point - Ozonolysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) at C7 is converted into a ketone (=O). The alcohol at C3 remains unchanged.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**. This conclusion was also unanimous among the candidates.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n    *   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n    *   **Careful Point - Identifying the Proton:** In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the carbinol proton (H-C3), the hydrogen attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. The electronegativity of the oxygen atom shifts this proton significantly downfield.\n    *   **Careful Point - Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. This makes the two sides of the molecule equivalent and is crucial for determining the coupling pattern.\n    *   **Careful Point - Analyzing the Coupling Environment:**\n        *   The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂) groups, so there are four neighboring protons in total.\n        *   Due to the plane of symmetry, these four neighbors can be divided into two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n            1.  A set of two equivalent *axial-type* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n            2.  A set of two equivalent *equatorial-type* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   Since the coupling constant between H-C3 and the axial-type protons (J_ax) is different from the coupling constant with the equatorial-type protons (J_eq), the signal is split sequentially.\n    *   **Conclusion on Splitting Pattern:** Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) gives a triplet (n+1=3). Each line of this triplet is then split again by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2), resulting in another triplet. The final, observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical analysis from all valid candidate answers consistently leads to the final product **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.

The electronegative oxygen atom pulls electron density away from this proton, shifting its signal significantly downfield.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Recognizing Molecular Symmetry.** The final product, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7.

A standard E2 elimination to form a double bond at a bridgehead carbon is forbidden by Bredt's rule. The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) are known to induce skeletal rearrangements.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Spectroscopic Data Interpretation):**\n    *   The IR absorbance at **1720 cm⁻¹** is a definitive indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR signal at **4.79 ppm (2H)** is the most crucial piece of data. This chemical shift is characteristic of vinylic protons, and the integration of 2H strongly suggests an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n    *   The total proton count is 14, meaning the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** To accommodate a ketone, a double bond, and a C₁₀H₁₄O formula, the tricyclic adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic (two-ring) system. The only reaction that explains this transformation and matches the spectral data is a **Grob fragmentation**. The resulting structure is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Reagent Selectivity):** This is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and, importantly, does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Reaction Type):** This is a standard **reductive ozonolysis**. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The dimethylsulfide serves as a mild reducing agent in the workup to convert the intermediate ozonide into carbonyl compounds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The exocyclic double bond (=CH₂) at position C7 is cleaved to form a ketone (=O). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected. The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Careful Point 5 (Identifying the Correct Proton):** In the final product, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, **H-C3**). The strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom shifts its signal significantly downfield, more so than any other proton on the carbon framework.\n*   **Careful Point 6 (Recognizing Molecular Symmetry):** The final product, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through atoms C3 and C7. This symmetry is essential for correctly determining the coupling pattern.\n*   **Careful Point 7 (Analyzing the Coupling Environment):**\n    *   The carbinol proton (H-C3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Because of the plane of symmetry, H-C3 is coupled to two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        1.  A pair of equivalent *axial-type* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        2.  A pair of equivalent *equatorial-type* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   The coupling constant to the axial-type pair (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-type pair (J_B).\n*   **Conclusion on the Coupling Pattern:** According to the n+1 rule, coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**. Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2) into another **triplet**. The resulting observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**. A pentet would only arise if all four neighboring protons were magnetically equivalent (i.e., had the same coupling constant to H-C3), which is not the case here.\n\n### **Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe chemical reasoning leads to the conclusion that the splitting pattern is a \"triplet of triplets\". Matching this with the provided options:\nA) triplet\nB) doublet of triplets\nC) pentet\nD) triplet of triplets\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n    *   **Analysis of Data:** The provided spectroscopic data is crucial. The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ confirms the formation of a ketone (C=O). The ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is a definitive indicator of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂). The total proton count of 14 (implying a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O) means the adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic system to accommodate both a ketone and a double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The reaction is a Grob fragmentation, a known rearrangement for this system under these harsh conditions. The structure that uniquely fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to an alcohol. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) at C7 is converted into a ketone (=O). The alcohol at C3 remains unchanged.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n    *   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. In Product 3, this is the carbinol proton (H-C3), the hydrogen attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. The electronegativity of the oxygen atom shifts this proton significantly downfield.\n    *   **Analyze the Coupling Environment:**\n        *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. This makes the two sides of the molecule (the C1/C2/C9 side and the C5/C4/C8 side) equivalent.\n        *   **Neighbors:** The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂) groups, so there are four neighboring protons in total.\n        *   **Equivalence:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the four neighboring protons are not all equivalent to each other. They can be divided into two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n            1.  A set of two equivalent *axial-type* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n            2.  A set of two equivalent *equatorial-type* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Splitting Pattern:** Since the coupling constant between H-C3 and the axial-type protons (J_ax) is different from the coupling constant with the equatorial-type protons (J_eq), the signal is split sequentially. Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) gives a triplet (n+1=3). Each line of this triplet is then split again by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2), resulting in another triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical transformations consistently lead to bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. The analysis of its ¹H NMR spectrum shows that the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton (H-C3) is coupled to two different pairs of equivalent protons. This gives rise to a \"triplet of triplets\" splitting pattern.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the provided options:\nA) pentet\nB) triplet of triplets\nC) doublet of triplets\nD) triplet\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the careful points required to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Interpreting the Reaction Conditions.** The starting material is a rigid, tricyclic cage.

The alcohol group at C3 remains unchanged.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThis final step requires a careful analysis of the structure of Product 3 to determine the coupling pattern.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Identifying the Correct Proton.** The question asks for the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. This is the proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, **H-C3**). The electronegative oxygen atom pulls electron density away from this proton, shifting its signal significantly downfield.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Recognizing Molecular Symmetry.** The final product, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through atoms C3 and C7. This symmetry is essential for correctly determining the coupling pattern.\n*   **Careful Point 7: Analyzing the Coupling Environment.**\n    *   The carbinol proton (H-C3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Because of the plane of symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an identical coupling environment to the two protons on C4.\n    *   This means H-C3 is coupled to two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        1.  A pair of equivalent *axial-like* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        2.  A pair of equivalent *equatorial-like* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   The coupling constant to the axial-like pair (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-like pair (J_B).\n*   **Conclusion on the Coupling Pattern:** According to the n+1 rule, the signal is split sequentially. Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**. Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2) into another **triplet**. The resulting observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\nA) pentet\nB) triplet\nC) triplet of triplets\nD) doublet of triplets\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
