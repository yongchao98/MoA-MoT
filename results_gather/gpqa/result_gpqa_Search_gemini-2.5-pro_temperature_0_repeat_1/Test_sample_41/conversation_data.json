    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula is:\n    T_eq ∝ ( (1-A) / a² )^(1/4)\n    where 'A' is the albedo and 'a' is the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n\n    Since the albedo 'A' is the same for all three planets, this term cancels out when we take ratios. The relationship simplifies to:\n    T_eq ∝ (1 / a²)^(1/4) = 1 / a^(1/2) = 1 / √a\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance:**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Combine the Relationships:**\n    Now, we can substitute the expression for 'a' from Kepler's Law into the temperature relationship:\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / (P^(2/3))^(1/2)\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n    This means the orbital period (P) is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature (T_eq):\n    P ∝ 1 / T_eq³ or P ∝ T_eq⁻³\n\n4.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio between Planet1 and Planet3:**\n    We are given the temperature ratios between adjacent planets:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n    To find the temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet3, we multiply these two ratios:\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = T_eq1 / T_eq3\n    1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n    So, T_eq1 / T_eq3 = 3.22\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orbital Period Ratio:**\n    Using the relationship P ∝ T_eq⁻³, we can find the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1:\n    P3 / P1 = (T_eq3 / T_eq1)³\n\n    Since we calculated T_eq1 / T_eq3 = 3.22, we have T_eq3 / T_eq1 = 1 / 3.22.\n    Alternatively, and more simply, we can write:\n    P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n    P3 / P1 = (3.22)³\n    P3 / P1 ≈ 33.386\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information about the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method is not needed for this calculation.\n\nComparing our result to the options provided:\nA) ~ 4.4\nB) ~ 3.2\nC) ~ 10.4\nD) ~ 33.4\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
