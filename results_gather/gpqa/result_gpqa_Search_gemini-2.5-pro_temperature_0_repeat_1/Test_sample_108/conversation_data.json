    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the permitted and non-permitted partial waves based on the given conservation laws and statistical rules.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State: 1S0\n\nThe initial state of the two-nucleon (NN) system is given by the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`.\nFor the **1S0** state:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_initial = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` corresponds to an orbital angular momentum `L_initial = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` gives the total angular momentum `J_initial = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is determined by `P_initial = (P_nucleon1) * (P_nucleon2) * (-1)^L_initial`. Since nucleons have an intrinsic parity of +1, this becomes `P_initial = (+1) * (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe decay process is `1S0 -> (NN)_final + X`.\n\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc.). The parity contribution from its motion is `(-1)^l_X`. Therefore, the total parity of particle X in the final state is `P_X_total = P(X) * (-1)^l_X = (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(l_X + 1)`.\n\n*   **Final NN State:** Its quantum numbers are `S_final`, `L_final`, and `J_final`. Its parity is `P_NN_final = (-1)^L_final`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved.\n    `P_initial = P_NN_final * P_X_total`\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_final * (-1)^(l_X + 1)`\n    This equation holds true only if the exponent `L_final + l_X + 1` is an even number. This is equivalent to requiring that **`L_final + l_X` must be an odd number**.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial total angular momentum is `J_initial = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_final`) and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`).\n    `J_initial = J_final + l_X` (vector addition)\n    For `J_initial` to be 0, the magnitudes of the final angular momenta must be equal: **`J_final = l_X`**.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The problem states that for the final NN state, where `T(NN) = 0`, the following condition must be met:\n    `T(NN) = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`\n    `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This means that `S_final + L_final + 1` must be an even number, which implies that **`S_final + L_final` must be an odd number**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Proposed Transition\n\nWe will now test each option against the three derived rules:\n1.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_final + L_final` must be odd.\n2.  **Parity Rule:** `L_final + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Angular Momentum Rule:** `J_final = l_X`.\n\n---\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (3S1): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 0`, `J_final = 1`.\n*   Particle X (p-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Rule:** `L_final + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum Rule:** `J_final = 1` and `l_X = 1`. They are equal. **OK.**\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n---\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (3D3): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 2`, `J_final = 3`.\n*   Particle X (f-wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Rule:** `L_final + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum Rule:** `J_final = 3` and `l_X = 3`. They are equal. **OK.**\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n---\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (3P0): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 1`, `J_final = 0`.\n*   Particle X (s-wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). **This violates the Pauli statistics requirement.**\n2.  **Parity Rule:** `L_final + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum Rule:** `J_final = 0` and `l_X = 0`. They are equal. **OK.**\n*Conclusion: This transition is not permitted because it fails the Pauli statistics rule.*\n\n---\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (7D1): `2S+1=7` -> `S_final = 3`, `L_final = 2`, `J_final = 1`.\n*   Particle X (p-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_final + L_final = 3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Rule:** `L_final + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (Odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum Rule:** `J_final = 1` and `l_X = 1`. They are equal. **OK.**\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\nThe only transition that is not permitted is C, as it violates the Pauli statistics condition for the final two-nucleon state.\n\n<<<C>>>"
