    "Based on electrochemical principles and data, the correct combination of terms to complete the statement is weaker and slower.\n\nThermodynamically, the oxidizing strength of a substance is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). For oxygen, the reduction reactions and their standard potentials are:\n*   In acidic solution: O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O, with E° = +1.23 V.\n*   In basic solution: O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻, with E° = +0.40 V.\n\nA substance with a higher (more positive) standard reduction potential is a stronger oxidizing agent. Since the standard reduction potential of oxygen in a basic solution (+0.40 V) is lower than in an acidic solution (+1.23 V), oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\nKinetically, the rate of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is known to be sluggish. However, when comparing the reaction in acidic versus alkaline (basic) media, studies show that the kinetics are more favorable in alkaline solutions. The sluggish kinetics in acidic environments is a major challenge for technologies like proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. In contrast, alkaline media can promote faster electron transfer for the oxygen reduction reaction. Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThus, the completed statement is: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
