    "Based on the provided analytical data, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Â¹H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, which have similar chemical shifts and integrate to a total of one proton. Since the protons are in different chemical environments but are otherwise part of the same molecular structure, this indicates the presence of two different stereoisomers. Enantiomers are indistinguishable in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment and would show only one peak. Diastereomers, however, are chemically distinct and are expected to have different NMR spectra, including different chemical shifts for corresponding protons.\n\n*   **LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) analysis shows two separable peaks of equal intensity. This demonstrates that there are two distinct compounds that can be separated based on their different physical properties, which is characteristic of diastereomers. Enantiomers would co-elute (appear as a single peak) on a standard, non-chiral LC column. The mass spectrometry (MS) data confirms that both peaks have the same mass, and this mass is consistent with the expected molecule. This rules out impurities like precursors or side-products with different molecular formulas (such as a 'double coupling' product).\n\n*   **Context of Peptide Synthesis:** In peptide synthesis, it is common for epimerization (the change in configuration at a single stereocenter) to occur as a side reaction. An epimer is a specific type of diastereomer. Another possibility is the formation of stable atropisomers, which are diastereomers that result from restricted rotation around a single bond (like an amide bond in a peptide). Both scenarios would result in a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers, which perfectly matches the observation of two peaks with equal integrals/intensities in the NMR and LC-MS, respectively.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Option A (Enantiomers)** is incorrect because enantiomers are not distinguishable by standard NMR or LC.\n*   **Option C (Double coupling)** is incorrect because it would result in a product with a higher mass.\n*   **Option D (Precursor contamination)** is incorrect because a precursor would have a different mass.\n*   **Option B (Diastereoisomers)** is the only explanation that fits all the data: two species that are chemically distinct (giving two NMR peaks and two LC peaks) but have the same molecular mass.\n\n<<<B>>>"
