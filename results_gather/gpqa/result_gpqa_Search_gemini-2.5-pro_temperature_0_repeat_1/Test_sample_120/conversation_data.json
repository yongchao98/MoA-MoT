    "The reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method for carbon-carbon bond formation. This reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism. The key principles governing the outcome are regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n**Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates are strong nucleophiles that attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6. C1 is substituted with a methyl group, while C6 is not. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from Me2CuLi will attack the less hindered C6.\n\n**Stereoselectivity:** The reaction occurs with an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked by the nucleophile. This is a characteristic feature of an SN2 reaction. The initial configuration at C6 is (S). The backside attack by the methyl nucleophile will invert this center to an (R) configuration in the product.\n\n**Reaction Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The methyl anion (Me‚Åª) from Me2CuLi attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, which is C6.\n2.  **Ring Opening:** The attack causes the C6-O bond to break. This relieves the ring strain of the epoxide.\n3.  **Protonation:** A subsequent workup step (not explicitly shown but implied in such reactions) protonates the resulting alkoxide at C1 to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n4.  **Product Formation:**\n    *   The original cyclohexane ring structure is maintained.\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 retain their positions and stereochemistry.\n    *   A new methyl group is added to C6.\n    *   A hydroxyl group is formed at C1.\n\n**Determining the Product Structure and Stereochemistry:**\n\n*   **Nomenclature:** The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is designated as C1.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The product will have methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5, making it a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options B and D.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **C1:** The configuration at the original C1 is retained, so it remains (R).\n    *   **C2 (originally C6):** The configuration inverts from (S) to (R).\n    *   **C4 (originally C4):** The configuration is retained as (R).\n    *   **C5 (originally C3):** The configuration is retained as (R).\n\nTherefore, the final product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>"
