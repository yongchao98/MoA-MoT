    "All of the provided statements concern the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2. After a thorough review of the scientific literature, the incorrect statement has been identified.\n\n**A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.** This statement makes a very specific claim about a linear correlation and the number of conformations. While the conformational plasticity of the pseudoknot is known to be important for regulating frameshifting efficiency, the precise nature of this correlation is a complex area of research.\n\n**B) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.** This statement is partially correct. Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting does create the pp1ab polyprotein by shifting the reading frame back by one nucleotide, and the pseudoknot structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are indeed very similar [2, 7, 17]. However, this event occurs at the junction of ORF1a and ORF1b, which is located roughly 13,500 nucleotides from the 5' end of the ~30,000 nucleotide genome, not \"near to 5' end of the genome\" [7].\n\n**C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.** This statement is supported by research. Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein can induce apoptosis by activating caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic pathway, without altering the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, which is central to the intrinsic pathway [9]. While some findings suggest this may also lead to a downstream activation of the intrinsic pathway, the initial mechanism described is accurate [14].\n\n**D) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.** This statement contains a significant error. The nsp14/nsp10 complex is indeed a heterodimer where nsp10 activates the N-terminal exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain of nsp14, which performs a proofreading function [5, 7]. However, its function is to *degrade* or *digest* RNA, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), to remove misincorporated nucleotides [1, 6, 8]. It does not prevent the breakdown of dsRNA; rather, it actively participates in it.\n\nThe incorrect statement is D because the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex is a nuclease that degrades dsRNA, it does not prevent its breakdown.\n\n<<<D>>>"
