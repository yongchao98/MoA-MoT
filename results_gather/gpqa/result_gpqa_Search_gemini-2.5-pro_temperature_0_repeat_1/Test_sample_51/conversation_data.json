    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two different energy levels changes, we can use the Boltzmann equation, which is appropriate here given the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) in the stellar photosphere.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy levels (E1 and E2):\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nHere, `g₁` and `g₂` are the statistical weights of the levels, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\nWe need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it does. This can be expressed as the ratio of the ratios at the two different temperatures:\n\nFactor = [ (N₂ / N₁)nospots ] / [ (N₂ / N₁)spots ]\n\nThe temperatures are given as:\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nThe statistical weights (g₁ and g₂) cancel out in the final factor calculation. The expression simplifies to:\n\nFactor = exp[ (E₂ - E₁) / k * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy difference (E₂ - E₁) from the given transition wavelength (λ = 1448 Å):\n\nΔE = E₂ - E₁ = h * c / λ\n\nUsing the values for Planck's constant (h), the speed of light (c), and the given wavelength (1448 Å = 1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m), we can find the energy difference.\n\nNext, we plug this energy difference, the Boltzmann constant (k), and the two temperatures into the factor equation.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n1.  Calculate the energy difference ΔE corresponding to λ = 1448 Å.\n2.  Calculate the term ΔE/k.\n3.  Calculate the difference in the inverse of the temperatures: (1/5500 K - 1/6000 K).\n4.  Multiply the results from steps 2 and 3 to get the exponent.\n5.  Calculate the final factor by taking the exponential of the result from step 4.\n\nFollowing these steps:\n*   ΔE/k ≈ 99443 K\n*   (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 1/66000 K⁻¹\n*   Exponent = 99443 / 66000 ≈ 1.5067\n*   Factor = exp(1.5067) ≈ 4.51\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
