    "To determine how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance (r), we first need to understand the relationship between distance and parallax, and then apply the given variation of star numbers with parallax.\n\n### Relationship between Distance and Parallax\n\nStellar parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a nearby star against the background of more distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. The distance to a star (r) is inversely proportional to its parallax. This relationship is often expressed with a simple formula when using the appropriate units:\n\n*   r = 1 / plx\n\nWhere 'r' is the distance in parsecs and 'plx' is the parallax angle in arcseconds. From this, we can also express parallax in terms of distance:\n\n*   plx = 1 / r\n\n### Relating Star Counts in Parallax and Distance\n\nThe problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵. This is best interpreted as the number of stars per unit of parallax, which we can write as a differential relationship:\n\n*   dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n\nHere, dN is the number of stars in a small parallax interval d(plx). We want to find how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance, which is dN/dr. To find this, we can use the chain rule of calculus:\n\n*   dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance:\n\n*   d(plx)/dr = d(1/r)/dr = -1/r²\n\nNow, we can substitute this and the given relationship for dN/d(plx) into the chain rule equation. We also replace 'plx' with '1/r' to express the final relationship in terms of distance 'r':\n\n*   dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (-1/r²)\n*   dN/dr ∝ (1/(1/r)⁵) * (-1/r²)\n*   dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)\n*   dN/dr ∝ -r³\n\nThe negative sign indicates the direction of the change, but the magnitude of how the number of stars per unit distance changes is proportional to r³.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) as approximately r³.\n\n<<<D>>>"
