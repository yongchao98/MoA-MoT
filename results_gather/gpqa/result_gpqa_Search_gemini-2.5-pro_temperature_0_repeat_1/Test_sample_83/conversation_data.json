    "When solving higher-dimensional heat equations with high-order finite difference approximations, the resulting system of ordinary differential equations is often solved using the matrix exponential function. For parallel processing, this exponential function is approximated by a rational function, which can then be decomposed.\n\nThe key to converting the sequential algorithm into a parallel one lies in the **linear partial fraction expansion of the fractional approximation**. This decomposition allows the problem to be broken down into a series of smaller, independent linear systems that can be solved concurrently on different processors. This approach is a common strategy for parallelizing the solution of the heat equation.\n\nWhile stability analysis is crucial for ensuring the numerical method is sound, and the presence of nonlocal boundary conditions adds complexity to the problem, neither is the primary enabler of parallelism in this context. Similarly, the nature of the roots of the fractional approximation (whether they are real or complex) influences the properties of the approximation but the parallelization itself hinges on the ability to perform a partial fraction decomposition.\n\n<<<A>>>"
