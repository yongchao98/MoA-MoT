    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-component of orbital angular momentum for two electrons, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, and obtaining the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both.\n\nThe state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>$.\nHere:\n*   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n*   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n*   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   $m = -1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nA measurement of the individual z-components of the angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, corresponds to projecting the coupled state onto the uncoupled basis, which is represented by $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $L_{z}$ are given by $m_l \\hbar$. We are looking for the outcome where the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the final state where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nA fundamental principle in the coupling of angular momenta is the conservation of the z-component. The total magnetic quantum number, $m$, must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$.\n\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nIn the given initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n\nFor the desired measurement outcome, we have:\n*   $m_{l1} = -1$\n*   $m_{l2} = -1$\n\nThe sum of these individual quantum numbers is:\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$\n\nSince the required sum ($m = -2$) for the measurement outcome does not match the z-component of the system's initial state ($m = -1$), this outcome is not possible. The expansion of the coupled state $|l=2, m=-1>$ into the uncoupled basis states can only contain terms for which $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$. The coefficient for the state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1>$, known as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, is zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$ simultaneously is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
