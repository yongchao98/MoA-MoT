    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\nFirst, the structure of the starting material, Compound X, is determined from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   The broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n*   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\nThis data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals indicate a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded and appear downfield. The two protons at 7.2 ppm are adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Region Analysis:**\n    *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** A methine (CH) proton, likely attached to the benzene ring (benzylic position) and coupled to several other protons.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A methylene (CH₂) group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl (CH₃) group coupled to a single proton (the methine at 2.9 ppm).\n    *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** A methyl (CH₃) group coupled to a methylene group (the one at 1.7 ppm).\n\nAssembling the alkyl fragments reveals a sec-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃] attached to the benzene ring. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction and Final Product\n\nCompound X, identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacts with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids to their corresponding alkanes. The reaction involves the reduction of the carboxyl group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\nThe 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced, converting the carboxylic acid group into a methyl group, while the rest of the molecule (the benzene ring and the sec-butyl group) remains unchanged.\n\nThe final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is the starting material.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene is the correct product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene has an incorrect alkyl isomer.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid is an entirely different structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
