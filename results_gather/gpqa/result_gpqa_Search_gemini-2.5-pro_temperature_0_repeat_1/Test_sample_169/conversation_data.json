    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, <S_y>, we use the formula:\n\n<S_y> = <ψ|S_y|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>\n\nWhere:\n*   **|ψ>** is the spin state, given as the column vector `[3i, 4]`.\n*   **<ψ|** is the bra vector, which is the conjugate transpose of |ψ>.\n*   **S_y** is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the state vector |ψ> and the bra vector <ψ|**:\n    The state vector (ket) is given as |ψ> = `[3i, 4]`.\n    The corresponding bra vector is the conjugate transpose. First, we take the complex conjugate of each element to get `[-3i, 4]`. Then, we transpose it, which results in the row vector <ψ| = `[-3i, 4]`.\n\n2.  **Define the spin operator S_y**:\n    The spin operator S_y is defined as (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix σ_y.\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n3.  **Calculate the normalization factor <ψ|ψ>**:\n    This is the inner product of the state with itself.\n    <ψ|ψ> = `[-3i, 4]` * `[3i, 4]`\n    <ψ|ψ> = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)\n    <ψ|ψ> = -9i² + 16\n    Since i² = -1:\n    <ψ|ψ> = 9 + 16 = 25\n\n4.  **Calculate the term S_y|ψ>**:\n    S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]` * `[3i, 4]`\n    S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * `[(0 * 3i) + (-i * 4), (i * 3i) + (0 * 4)]`\n    S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * `[-4i, 3i²]`\n    S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * `[-4i, -3]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the full numerator <ψ|S_y|ψ>**:\n    <ψ|S_y|ψ> = `[-3i, 4]` * ( (ħ/2) * `[-4i, -3]` )\n    <ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * `[(-3i * -4i) + (4 * -3)]`\n    <ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * `[12i² - 12]`\n    <ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * `[-12 - 12]`\n    <ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * (-24)\n    <ψ|S_y|ψ> = -12ħ\n\n6.  **Calculate the final expectation value <S_y>**:\n    <S_y> = <ψ|S_y|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>\n    <S_y> = -12ħ / 25\n    <S_y> = -12*hbar/25\n\nThis result matches a solved problem with the same spin state.\n\n<<<B>>>"
