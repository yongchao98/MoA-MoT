    "To determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density:** In 4-dimensional spacetime, the action, S = ∫d⁴x L, is a dimensionless quantity. The spacetime volume element d⁴x has a mass dimension of [d⁴x] = M⁻⁴. Therefore, the Lagrangian density L must have a mass dimension of [L] = M⁴ to ensure the action is dimensionless.\n\n2.  **Mass Dimension of the Fermion Field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion field in the Lagrangian is L_kinetic = iψ̄γ^μ∂_μψ. This term must have a mass dimension of 4. The derivative ∂_μ has a mass dimension of [∂_μ] = M¹. The fields ψ and ψ̄ have the same mass dimension. Therefore, we have:\n    [L_kinetic] = [ψ][ψ̄][∂_μ] = M⁴\n    [ψ]² * M¹ = M⁴\n    [ψ]² = M³\n    [ψ] = M^(3/2)\n    So, the mass dimension of the fermion field ψ (and ψ̄) is 3/2.\n\n3.  **Mass Dimension of the Field Strength Tensor (F^(μν)):** The kinetic term for a gauge field in the Lagrangian is L_gauge = -1/4 F_(μν)F^(μν). This term must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n    [L_gauge] = [F^(μν)]² = M⁴\n    [F^(μν)] = M²\n    So, the mass dimension of the field strength tensor F^(μν) is 2.\n\n4.  **Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant (κ):** Now we analyze the given interaction Lagrangian, L_int = κψ̄σ_(μν)ψF^(μν). This term must also have a mass dimension of 4. The term σ_(μν) = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν] is composed of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. We can now determine the mass dimension of κ:\n    [L_int] = [κ][ψ̄][σ_(μν)][ψ][F^(μν)] = M⁴\n    [κ] * M^(3/2) * M⁰ * M^(3/2) * M² = M⁴\n    [κ] * M³ * M² = M⁴\n    [κ] * M⁵ = M⁴\n    [κ] = M⁻¹\n    The mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n5.  **Renormalizability of the Theory:** The renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n    *   If the mass dimension of the coupling constant is positive, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n    *   If the mass dimension is zero, the theory is renormalizable.\n    *   If the mass dimension is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nCombining our findings, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n<<<B>>>"
