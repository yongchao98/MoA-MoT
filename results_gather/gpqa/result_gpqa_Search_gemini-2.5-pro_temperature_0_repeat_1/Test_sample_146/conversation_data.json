    "To determine the velocity of particle A, we apply the principle of conservation of energy. The annihilation process begins with a proton and a slowly moving antiproton, and it results in four particles of type A.\n\n**1. Initial Energy (E_initial)**\n\nThe initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. Since the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" its kinetic energy is considered negligible. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV. An antiproton has the same rest mass.\n\n*   E_initial = (Rest energy of proton) + (Rest energy of antiproton)\n*   E_initial = m_p * c^2 + m_p̄ * c^2\n*   E_initial ≈ 938.27 MeV + 938.27 MeV = 1876.54 MeV\n\n**2. Final Energy (E_final)**\n\nThe final state consists of four particles (2A⁺ and 2A⁻), each with a rest mass energy of 300 MeV. Since the initial momentum of the system is nearly zero, the four resulting particles must move apart with significant kinetic energy to conserve momentum. By symmetry, it's assumed they will all have the same total energy (E_A).\n\nThe total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic energy equation:\n*   E_A = γ * m_A * c^2\nwhere γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\nThe total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n*   E_final = 4 * E_A = 4 * γ * m_A * c^2\n*   E_final = 4 * γ * (300 MeV) = 1200 * γ MeV\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy**\n\nBy equating the initial and final energies:\n*   E_initial = E_final\n*   1876.54 MeV = 1200 * γ MeV\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nNow, we solve for the Lorentz factor, γ:\n*   γ = 1876.54 / 1200\n*   γ ≈ 1.5638\n\nNext, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity (v):\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (v/c)²)\n*   γ² = 1 / (1 - (v/c)²)\n*   1 - (v/c)² = 1 / γ²\n*   (v/c)² = 1 - (1 / γ²)\n*   (v/c)² = 1 - (1 / 1.5638²)\n*   (v/c)² = 1 - (1 / 2.4455)\n*   (v/c)² = 1 - 0.4089\n*   (v/c)² = 0.5911\n*   v/c = √0.5911\n*   v/c ≈ 0.7688\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<D>>>"
