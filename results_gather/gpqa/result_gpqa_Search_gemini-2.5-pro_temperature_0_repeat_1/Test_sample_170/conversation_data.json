    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric properties of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\nThe substances are:\n1)  **Toluene** (C₆H₅-CH₃)\n2)  **Ethyl benzoate** (C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅)\n3)  **Chlorobenzene** (C₆H₅-Cl)\n4)  **Nitrobenzene** (C₆H₅-NO₂)\n5)  **Ethylbenzene** (C₆H₅-C₂H₅)\n6)  **Benzoic acid** (C₆H₅-COOH)\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their directing effects for electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer. The groups in this category are:\n    *   -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4)\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6)\n    *   -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2)\n\n    Among these, the nitro group (-NO₂) is the strongest deactivating group, followed by the carboxyl group (-COOH), and then the ester group (-COOC₂H₅). A stronger deactivating effect leads to higher meta-selectivity and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three substances is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by steric hindrance. The groups in this category are:\n    *   -CH₃ (Toluene, 1)\n    *   -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5)\n    *   -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3)\n\n    1.  **-CH₃ (Toluene) vs. -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming electrophile. As a result, ethylbenzene produces a higher percentage of the para-isomer compared to toluene. So, the order is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n    2.  **-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director due to its resonance effect. Halogens typically give a high yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitution reactions, often higher than alkylbenzenes, because the ortho positions are significantly deactivated by the strong inductive effect. For example, in nitration, chlorobenzene yields about 70% of the para-isomer, whereas toluene yields only about 37%. A similar high selectivity for the para position is expected for bromination.\n\n    Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n**Combining the two groups:**\n\nThe meta-directing substances will have the lowest para-isomer yields, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances.\n\nCombining the established orders:\n(4 < 6 < 2) and (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
