    "To determine the mean decay distance of the X meson, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Calculate the proper lifetime (τ) of the particle.**\n\nThe proper lifetime (τ) is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. It is related to the decay width (Γ) by the formula derived from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nGiven:\n*   Decay width, Γ_X = 320 MeV\n*   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s\n\nCalculation:\nτ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV\nτ ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n**2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) of the particle.**\n\nThe Lorentz factor describes the time dilation and length contraction for an object moving at relativistic speeds. It is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m*c²).\n\nGiven:\n*   Production energy, E_X = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV/c² = 1200 MeV/c²\n\nCalculation:\nγ = E_X / (m_X * c²) = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.667\n\n**3. Calculate the particle's velocity (β) as a fraction of the speed of light.**\n\nThe velocity (β = v/c) is related to the Lorentz factor by the equation:\nβ = √(1 - 1/γ²)\n\nCalculation:\nβ = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) ≈ 0.9887\n\n**4. Calculate the mean decay distance (L).**\n\nThe mean decay distance in the laboratory frame is the distance the particle travels, on average, before it decays. This distance is affected by time dilation, so we use the lifetime in the lab frame (γτ). The formula is:\nL = γ * β * c * τ\n\nGiven:\n*   Speed of light, c ≈ 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s\n\nCalculation:\nL = (20/3) * √(391/400) * (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nL ≈ 6.667 * 0.9887 * (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nL ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nB) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nC) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nD) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
