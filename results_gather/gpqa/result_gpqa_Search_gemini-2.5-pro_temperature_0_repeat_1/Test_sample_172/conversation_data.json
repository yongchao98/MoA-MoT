    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n**1. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) and the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp). A common form of this principle is:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n*   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is Planck's constant (h) divided by 2π (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\nGiven that Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\n\nΔp ≥ ħ / (2 * Δx)\nΔp ≥ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp ≥ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n\nSince the electron is traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s), we must use the relativistic formula for energy:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n\nwhere:\n*   E is the total energy.\n*   p is the momentum.\n*   m₀ is the rest mass of the electron (approximately 9.11 x 10⁻³¹ kg).\n*   c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\n\nTo find the relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp), we can differentiate the energy-momentum equation. Differentiating both sides with respect to momentum (p) gives:\n\n2E (dE/dp) = 2pc²\ndE = (pc²/E) dp\n\nFor small uncertainties, we can approximate this as:\n\nΔE ≈ (pc²/E) Δp\n\nFrom the definitions of relativistic energy and momentum, we know that E = γm₀c² and p = γm₀v, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Substituting these into the equation for ΔE:\n\nΔE ≈ ( (γm₀v)c² / (γm₀c²) ) Δp\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\n**3. Calculate the Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE):**\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of the electron's speed (v) and the minimum uncertainty in its momentum (Δp) to find the minimum uncertainty in its energy (ΔE):\n\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis value is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<A>>>"
