    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in condensed ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from the positions ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\nIn this specific molecule, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Pathway 1: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. The subsequent addition of the amide nucleophile (NH₂⁻) to this benzyne can occur at two positions:\n    *   **Attack at C1:** This leads to the formation of 2-deuterioaniline (o-deuterioaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** This leads to the formation of 3-deuterioaniline (m-deuterioaniline).\n\n2.  **Pathway 2: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is generally slower than proton abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect. This elimination also results in the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium label is removed from the molecule. The addition of the amide nucleophile to this benzyne intermediate (at either C1 or C2) yields a single product:\n    *   **Aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\nCombining the outcomes of both pathways, three distinct organic products are possible:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
