    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the major products of the two rearrangements:\n\n### **Reaction A: (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene + (1. BuLi, 2. H+) → A**\n\nThis reaction is a Wittig rearrangement of an ether. The starting material is benzyl prenyl ether, Ph-CH₂-O-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂.\n\n1.  **Deprotonation:** Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. In this molecule, the benzylic protons (on the -CH₂- group attached to the phenyl ring) are the most acidic due to the resonance stabilization of the resulting carbanion by the benzene ring.\n2.  **Rearrangement:** The resulting carbanion can undergo two competing rearrangements: the-Wittig rearrangement and the-Wittig rearrangement.\n    *   The **-Wittig rearrangement** is a concerted, pericyclic reaction that is generally favored at low temperatures (below -60 °C). It would lead to the formation of 2,2-dimethyl-1-phenylbut-3-en-1-ol. This product is not listed in the options.\n    *   The **-Wittig rearrangement** is a non-concerted process that proceeds through a radical-pair intermediate. It becomes more competitive at higher temperatures but can also be favored if the radical intermediates are particularly stable. In this case, the fragmentation would lead to a stable benzyl radical and a stable tertiary allylic (prenyl) radical. Recombination of these radicals yields the product.\n3.  **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The product of the-rearrangement is **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**. This compound is present in options B and C.\n    *   Given that the kinetically favored product is not an option, it is logical to conclude that under the conditions of the reaction, the thermodynamically influenced rearrangement product is the major one formed.\n\nTherefore, product **A** is **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 3,4,5,7,8,9-hexamethyl-1,11-dimethylene-2,6,10,11,11a,11b-hexahydro-1H-benzo[cd]indeno[7,1-gh]azulene + Heat → B**\n\nThis reaction is described as a Cope rearrangement, which is a thermal-sigmatropic rearrangement of a 1,5-diene.\n\n1.  **Nature of the Reaction:** A Cope rearrangement is an isomerization reaction. This means that the molecular formula and the degree of unsaturation (the number of rings and π-bonds) of the product are identical to those of the starting material. No atoms are gained or lost.\n2.  **Analysis of Starting Material and Products:**\n    *   The name of the starting material includes the term \"**hexahydro**,\" indicating its level of saturation.\n    *   The name of the product in option B is a \"**tetrahydro**\" derivative, which means it has two fewer hydrogen atoms than a \"hexahydro\" compound. This would imply an oxidation reaction, not a simple thermal rearrangement.\n    *   The name of the product in option C is a \"**hexahydro**\" derivative. This is consistent with an isomerization reaction like the Cope rearrangement, where the molecular formula remains unchanged.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Without needing to decipher the complex structures, we can deduce the correct product based on the principle that a Cope rearrangement is an isomerization. Since the starting material is a \"hexahydro\" compound, the product must also be a \"hexahydro\" compound.\n\nTherefore, product **B** is **2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro-1H-benzoazuleno[1,8,7,6-cdef]fluorene**.\n\n### **Final Selection**\n\n*   Product A is **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**.\n*   Product B is **2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro-1H-benzoazuleno[1,8,7,6-cdef]fluorene**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
