    "The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\nThe analysis of the provided NMR data leads to the unambiguous identification of the reaction product.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Product's NMR Spectra:**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H), which are characteristic of two isolated methyl groups. The pattern of two doublets at δ 7.71 (2H) and δ 7.08 (2H) is a classic indicator of a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets at δ 7.68 (1H) and δ 6.75 (1H) suggest two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond that are coupled to each other (vinylic protons).\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The signal at δ 197.7 is indicative of a ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O). The signals at δ 21.3 and δ 28.4 correspond to the two methyl carbons. The remaining six signals in the range of δ 126.9 to δ 144.1 account for the six carbons of the benzene ring and the two carbons of the C=C double bond.\n\n2.  **Deduction of the Product's Structure:**\n    *   Combining these observations, the product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with a *para*-substituted tolyl group. The structure is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    *   Let's assign the signals to this structure:\n        *   The methyl group on the benzene ring corresponds to the singlet at δ 2.31 and the carbon signal at δ 21.3.\n        *   The methyl group of the ketone corresponds to the singlet at δ 2.28 and the carbon signal at δ 28.4.\n        *   The *para*-substituted ring gives rise to the two 2H doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR.\n        *   The vinylic protons (-CH=CH-) adjacent to the carbonyl group appear as two doublets.\n        *   The ketone carbonyl carbon is the signal at δ 197.7.\n    *   The molecular formula of this product is C11H12O, which matches that of the starting Compound X.\n\n3.  **Identification of Compound X:**\n    *   The reaction is an isomerization, where Compound X is converted into 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This means Compound X must have the same atoms, just arranged differently.\n    *   The product contains a 4-methylphenyl group (a *p*-tolyl group). Therefore, the starting material must also contain this structural unit.\n    *   Let's examine the given options:\n        *   **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** Contains a 4-methylphenyl group. Its formula is C11H12O.\n        *   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** Contains a phenyl group (C6H5-), not a 4-methylphenyl group. Its formula is C10H10O.\n        *   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** Contains a phenyl group.\n        *   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** Contains a phenyl group.\n    *   Only option A has the required 4-methylphenyl group and the correct molecular formula.\n\n4.  **Reaction Confirmation:**\n    *   The reaction described is a base-catalyzed rearrangement of an epoxide. Specifically, the use of DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) at elevated temperatures (403 K is 130 °C) is known to catalyze the Meinwald rearrangement of terminal epoxides, including vinyl epoxides, into methyl ketones. This reaction transforms an epoxide like 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane into the corresponding α,β-unsaturated ketone, 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The reaction conditions and the structural transformation are chemically sound.\n\nBased on the conclusive evidence from the product's structure, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<A>>>"
