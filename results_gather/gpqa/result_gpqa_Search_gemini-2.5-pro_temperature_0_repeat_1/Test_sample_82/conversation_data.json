    "The initial calculations were correct. The provided Ka for acetic acid (1.85x10⁻⁵) is a commonly accepted value, though slight variations exist (1.76x10⁻⁵, 1.8x10⁻⁵). The pKa is therefore around 4.73-4.76. The steps for calculating the pH at different points in a weak acid-strong base titration are standard and confirmed by multiple sources.\n\n1.  **Dilution:** The initial 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted by half, resulting in a 0.025 M solution.\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:** This point is in the buffer region. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])) is used.\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] to acid [HA] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26\n3.  **pH at Equivalence Point:** At this point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n    *   First, determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n        *   Moles acid = 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n        *   Volume NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n    *   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n        *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n        *   [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n    *   Calculate Kb for acetate from the Ka of acetic acid (Kw = Ka * Kb).\n        *   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Calculate the [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis of acetate: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n        *   Kb = [OH⁻]² / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        *   [OH⁻] = √(Kb * [CH₃COO⁻]) = √((5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   Calculate pOH and then pH.\n        *   pOH = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
