    "The problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, denoted as ∫∇⋅f dV, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nThe vector field f(r) is characterized by:\n*   **Magnitude**: The magnitude of the field is given by f(r) = 1/r², where r is the radial distance from the origin.\n*   **Direction**: The field is directed radially outwards.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, this vector field can be expressed as f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, where r̂ is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nTo solve this, we can employ the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the outward flux of the vector field through the closed surface S that encloses the volume V. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n∫ (∇⋅f) dV = ∮ (f ⋅ dS)\n\nHere, dS is the differential surface area vector on the sphere's surface. For a sphere of radius R, dS = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ r̂.\n\nThe flux integral is calculated as follows:\n∮ (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[from 0 to 2π] ∫[from 0 to π] ( (1/R²) r̂ ) ⋅ ( R² sin(θ) dθ dφ r̂ )\n\nSince r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1, the expression simplifies to:\n= ∫[from 0 to 2π] dφ ∫[from 0 to π] sin(θ) dθ\n\nEvaluating the integrals:\n*   The integral of dφ from 0 to 2π is 2π.\n*   The integral of sin(θ) from 0 to π is [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nMultiplying these results gives the total flux:\nFlux = 2π * 2 = 4π.\n\nIt is important to note that a direct calculation of the divergence of f(r) in spherical coordinates for r ≠ 0 yields zero. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a purely radial field F_r is ∇⋅f = (1/r²) ∂(r² F_r)/∂r. For f(r) = 1/r², this becomes ∇⋅f = (1/r²) ∂(r² * 1/r²)/∂r = (1/r²) ∂(1)/∂r = 0.\n\nHowever, the vector field has a singularity at the origin (r=0), where its value is undefined. This singularity acts as a source, and its contribution is captured by the Divergence Theorem when applied to the entire volume including the origin. The flux through any closed surface enclosing the origin is constant and equal to 4π.\n\nTherefore, the volume integral of the divergence of the field within the sphere of radius R is 4π.\n\n<<<C>>>"
