    "To determine the flux ratio, we must first understand which solar neutrino sources contribute to each energy band and how they are affected by the hypothetical shutdown of the pp-III branch.\n\n### Solar Neutrino Sources and Energy Bands\n\nThe primary nuclear fusion process in the Sun is the proton-proton (pp) chain, which has several branches, along with the less dominant CNO (Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen) cycle. Each reaction produces neutrinos with a characteristic energy spectrum.\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):** Neutrinos in this energy range come from the continuous spectra of a few sources. The main contributors are Boron-8 (⁸B) decay and neutrinos from the CNO cycle (specifically from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays).\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band also receives contributions from the continuous spectra of ⁸B and the CNO cycle. However, it is overwhelmingly dominated by a very strong, discrete energy line at 861 keV from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (⁷Be). A much weaker ⁷Be line exists at a lower energy, but the 861 keV line is the most prominent in this context.\n\n### The Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch\n\nThe pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain is a sequence of reactions that results in the production of Boron-8. The subsequent beta decay of ⁸B is the source of the high-energy ⁸B neutrinos.\n\n*   **Reaction Stopped:** pp-III branch.\n*   **Neutrino Source Eliminated:** Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos.\n\nCrucially, the ⁷Be neutrinos are produced in the pp-II branch, not the pp-III branch. Therefore, under the hypothetical scenario, the production of ⁷Be neutrinos continues unaffected.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nWith the pp-III branch stopped, we can re-evaluate the neutrino flux in each band:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The contribution from ⁸B neutrinos disappears. The only remaining flux is the relatively small contribution from CNO cycle neutrinos.\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** The contribution from ⁸B neutrinos also disappears from this band. However, the extremely strong flux from the 861 keV ⁷Be neutrino line remains, as it belongs to the unaffected pp-II branch. This band also retains a small contribution from CNO neutrinos.\n\nThe flux in Band 2 is now dominated by the ⁷Be neutrino line, which is orders of magnitude greater than the remaining CNO flux. The flux of ⁷Be neutrinos is on the order of 10⁹ particles·cm⁻²·s⁻¹, whereas the total fluxes for the relevant CNO neutrinos are on the order of 10⁸ particles·cm⁻²·s⁻¹, and this flux is spread over a wide energy range.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is approximately:\n\nFlux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) ≈ (small CNO flux) / (large ⁷Be flux + small CNO flux)\n\nThis simplifies to a small number divided by a very large number. The flux from the ⁷Be line is roughly 100 times greater than the integrated CNO flux in a 100 keV band.\n\nThe resulting ratio is approximately 1/100, or 0.01.\n\n<<<C>>>"
