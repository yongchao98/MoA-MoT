    "To determine the time elapsed for the astronaut, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nFirst, we need the distance from Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, located at a distance of about 163,000 light-years. Some estimates place it closer to 160,000 light-years. For this calculation, we will use the value of approximately 160,000 light-years, as it aligns best with the provided options.\n\n**1. Time from Earth's Perspective:**\nFirst, we calculate the travel time from the perspective of an observer on Earth.\n*   **Distance (d):** 160,000 light-years\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c (where c is the speed of light)\n\nThe time (t) is distance divided by speed:\nt = d / v = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c) ≈ 160,000.02 years\n\nFrom Earth's frame of reference, the journey takes approximately 160,000 years.\n\n**2. Time from the Astronaut's Perspective (Time Dilation):**\nDue to the effects of time dilation, time passes slower for the astronaut traveling at relativistic speeds. The time experienced by the astronaut (t') is the Earth-based time (t) multiplied by the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\nt' = t * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nLet's calculate the term √(1 - v²/c²):\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   (v/c)² = 0.99999987² ≈ 0.99999974\n*   1 - (v/c)² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026\n*   √(0.00000026) ≈ 0.0005099\n\nNow, we can find the time experienced by the astronaut:\nt' ≈ 160,000.02 years * 0.0005099 ≈ 81.58 years\n\nThe journey will take approximately 81.6 years from the astronaut's point of view.\n\n**3. Astronaut's Age and Survival:**\nThe astronaut's age upon arrival would be their initial age plus the travel time:\nFinal Age = 22 years + 81.6 years = 103.6 years\n\nSince the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey. This eliminates option A.\n\nComparing our calculated travel time of ~81.6 years with the given options, the closest answer is 81 years.\n\n<<<B>>>"
