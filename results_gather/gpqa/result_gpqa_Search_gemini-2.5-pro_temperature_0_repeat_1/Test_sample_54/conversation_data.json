    "The provided 1H NMR data can be used to determine the structure of the unknown organic compound by analyzing each signal.\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal corresponds to three equivalent protons, characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (C=O) group, such as in an acetate.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet indicates that there are no adjacent protons to couple with. This confirms the presence of an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃) in the molecule. All four possible compounds contain an acetate group, so this signal confirms part of the structure but does not differentiate between the options.\n\n2.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This downfield shift is characteristic of a vinylic proton (a proton attached to a carbon-carbon double bond).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** The magnitude of the coupling constant is crucial for determining the stereochemistry of the double bond. A J-value of 12-18 Hz is characteristic of a *trans* relationship between two vinylic protons. Cis coupling constants are typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz. This large coupling constant strongly indicates a *trans* configuration, which eliminates the *cis* isomers: Cis-propenyl acetate and Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal also represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic proton region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets indicates that this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The doublet (d) arises from coupling to the single vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm. The quartet (q) arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent protons (an adjacent methyl group, according to the n+1 rule).\n\n4.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet indicates this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This matches the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm, which is split into a quartet by these three protons.\n\n### Assembling the Structure:\n\n*   The data points to a structure with an acetate group, a *trans* double bond, and a methyl group attached to the double bond.\n*   Let's evaluate the remaining options: **Trans-propenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**.\n\n*   **Trans-propenyl acetate (CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃):**\n    *   Acetate methyl group: Yes, gives the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n    *   Vinylic protons in a *trans* arrangement: Yes. One proton is coupled to the other vinylic proton (doublet). The other vinylic proton is coupled to the first vinylic proton and the adjacent methyl group (doublet of quartets). This perfectly matches the signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm.\n    *   Methyl group on the double bond: Yes, this would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent vinylic proton, matching the signal at 1.6 ppm.\n\n*   **Trans-butenyl acetate:** There are several isomers, but none fit the data. For example:\n    *   *Trans-1-butenyl acetate (CH₃CH₂-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃):* This would show signals for an ethyl group (a quartet and a triplet), which are not present.\n    *   *Trans-2-butenyl acetate (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-C(=O)-CH₃):* This would have a methylene (CH₂) group signal and different splitting patterns for the vinylic protons. The proton count also does not match (3H+1H+1H+2H+3H = 10H total, whereas the data shows 1H+1H+3H+3H = 8H).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe 1H NMR data is fully consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The key identifier is the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), which confirms the *trans* stereochemistry, and the splitting patterns (dq and d) which confirm the connectivity of the propenyl group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
