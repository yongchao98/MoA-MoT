    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reaction:** This chiral ketone is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. The ketone group at the third carbon position is reduced to a hydroxyl group. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products:** Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged, the reaction produces two different products. The new stereocenter at C3 can have either an (R) or (S) configuration. This results in the formation of two diastereomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n### Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** This diketone is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBHâ‚„), which reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at the C2 and C4 positions.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the achiral starting material results in three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n### Combined Products Analysis\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. In total, there are five different stereoisomeric compounds:\n\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound from Reaction II)\n\n### HPLC Analysis\n\nThe combined product mixture is analyzed using two different HPLC techniques.\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, like polarity. It does not distinguish between enantiomers.\n\n*   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers, which have different physical properties and will therefore be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different physical properties, eluting as a **separate, single peak**.\n\nThus, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram is 2 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### Chiral HPLC\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will be separated from each other, giving **two peaks**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is also a unique stereoisomer and will be separated from the others, resulting in **one peak**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram is 2 + 2 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
