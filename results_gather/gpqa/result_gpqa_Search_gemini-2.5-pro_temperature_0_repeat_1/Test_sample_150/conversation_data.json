    "To calculate the probability that the measurement of an observable will yield a specific value, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics. The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator corresponding to the observable. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the State Vector and the Observable Operator:**\n    *   The state of the system, `|ψ⟩`, is given by the column matrix:\n        ```\n        [-1]\n        [ 2]\n        [ 1]\n        ```\n    *   The observable, `P`, is represented by the matrix:\n        ```\n        [0,   1/√2,  0  ]\n        [1/√2, 0,   1/√2]\n        [0,   1/√2,  0  ]\n        ```\n\n2.  **Find the Eigenvalues of the Operator P:**\n    To find the possible outcomes of the measurement, we must calculate the eigenvalues (λ) of the operator P by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n    ```\n    det | -λ     1/√2    0      |\n        | 1/√2   -λ      1/√2   | = 0\n        | 0      1/√2    -λ     |\n    ```\n    This simplifies to `-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0`, which gives `-λ³ + λ = 0`, or `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`. The solutions, and therefore the eigenvalues, are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1. This confirms that a measurement result of 0 is possible.\n\n3.  **Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue λ = 0:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` that corresponds to the eigenvalue 0 by solving the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`.\n    ```\n    [0,   1/√2,  0  ] [x]   [0]\n    [1/√2, 0,   1/√2] [y] = [0]\n    [0,   1/√2,  0  ] [z]   [0]\n    ```\n    From the first and third rows, we get `(1/√2)y = 0`, which means `y = 0`.\n    From the second row, we get `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, which simplifies to `x = -z`.\n    Thus, any eigenvector for λ=0 is a multiple of `[1, 0, -1]`.\n\n4.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    To use the eigenvector in the probability calculation, it must be normalized. The norm of `[1, 0, -1]` is `√(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector, `|û₀⟩`, is `(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 is given by the formula `Prob(0) = |⟨û₀|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`.\n    *   First, we calculate the inner product `⟨û₀|ψ⟩`:\n        `⟨û₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1] · [-1, 2, 1] = (1/√2)((1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1)) = (1/√2)(-1 - 1) = -2/√2 = -√2`.\n    *   Next, we square its magnitude: `|⟨û₀|ψ⟩|² = (-√2)² = 2`.\n    *   Then, we find the squared norm of the state vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:\n        `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    *   Finally, the probability is the ratio of these two values:\n        `Prob(0) = 2 / 6 = 1/3`.\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
