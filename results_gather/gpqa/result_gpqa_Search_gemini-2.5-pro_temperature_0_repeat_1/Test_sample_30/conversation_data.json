    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n### Step-by-step Reaction Analysis\n\n**1. Toluene treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid (Product 1)**\n\nThis is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) on toluene is an ortho, para-director. The reaction of toluene with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid typically yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. For the subsequent reactions to proceed logically, we will consider the major isomer formed, which is often the para-isomer due to less steric hindrance, or recognize that either isomer could be used. Let's assume Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene**.\n\n**2. Product 1 treated with MnO2 and H2SO4 (Product 2)**\n\nThis step involves the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene. While strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 are commonly used to convert the methyl group of toluene to a carboxylic acid, a mixture of manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) can be used to oxidize toluene and its derivatives. Depending on the conditions, this can yield either the aldehyde or the carboxylic acid. The reaction of toluene with MnO2 and aqueous H2SO4 can produce benzaldehyde. This is a more plausible intermediate for the next step. Therefore, the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene is oxidized to an aldehyde group.\n\n*   **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde.**\n\n**3. Product 2 treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (Product 3)**\n\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The base (sodium hydroxide) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde, which lacks α-hydrogens. The resulting aldol adduct readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated system.\n\n*   The final product, **Product 3**, is **4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n### Molecular Symmetry of Product 3\n\nNow, we must determine the molecular symmetry group for 4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a p-nitrophenyl group connected to a butenone chain (-CH=CH-C(=O)CH3). Due to the extensive system of pi-conjugation involving the benzene ring, the carbon-carbon double bond, and the carbonyl group, the most stable conformation of the molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** Present in all molecules.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Since the molecule is planar in its most stable conformation, the plane containing all the heavy atoms (and the hydrogens of the ring and double bond) is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Axis of Rotation (Cn):** There are no rotational axes (other than the trivial C1). A C2 axis along the bond connecting the phenyl ring to the butenone chain is not possible because rotating by 180° would not leave the molecule unchanged (the keto and methyl groups of the butenone moiety are not symmetric).\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n\nA molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nBased on the analysis of the reaction sequence and the symmetry elements of the final product, the molecular symmetry group is Cs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
