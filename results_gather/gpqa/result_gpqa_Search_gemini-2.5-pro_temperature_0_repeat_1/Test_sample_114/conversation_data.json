    "The search results confirm the fundamental principles I used.\n1.  **Conservation of Energy and Momentum:** This is the core principle for solving this problem.\n2.  **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The formula E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)² is correct. For a photon, with m₀=0, this simplifies to E = pc.\n3.  **Relativistic Energy and Momentum:** The energy E = γm₀c² and momentum p = √(E² - (m₀c²)²)/c = √(γ² - 1)m₀c are correct.\n4.  **Annihilation Process:** The collision of an electron and positron can produce two photons. If the initial net momentum is not zero, the photons will not be emitted at exactly 180 degrees to each other.\n\nThe steps I've outlined are consistent with the physics described in the search results. The calculation involves applying these conservation laws to the specific initial conditions (Lorentz factors of 4 and 2). The logic seems sound, and the mathematical derivation is straightforward. I am confident in my initial calculation.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Initial Energy (E_i):**\n    *   E_electron = 4 * m_e * c²\n    *   E_positron = 2 * m_e * c²\n    *   E_i = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²\n\n2.  **Final Energy (E_f):**\n    *   E_f = E_photon1 + E_photon2\n    *   Given E_photon1 = E_photon2 = E_ph\n    *   E_f = 2 * E_ph\n    *   From energy conservation (E_i = E_f): 6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_ph  => E_ph = 3 * m_e * c²\n\n3.  **Initial Momentum (P_i):**\n    *   p = sqrt(γ² - 1) * m_e * c\n    *   p_electron = sqrt(4² - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(15) * m_e * c (moving right, +)\n    *   p_positron = sqrt(2² - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(3) * m_e * c (moving left, -)\n    *   P_i_x = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c\n    *   P_i_y = 0\n\n4.  **Final Momentum (P_f):**\n    *   For a photon, p = E/c.\n    *   p_ph = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c\n    *   Let the angle of each photon with the x-axis be θ and -θ.\n    *   P_f_x = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n    *   P_f_y = p_ph * sin(θ) + p_ph * sin(-θ) = 0\n\n5.  **Conservation of Momentum (P_i = P_f):**\n    *   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n    *   cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n6.  **Angle between photons (2θ):**\n    *   θ = arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)\n    *   Angle = 2θ = 2 * arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)\n    *   Angle ≈ 2 * arccos((3.873 - 1.732) / 6) = 2 * arccos(0.3568) ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThe calculation confirms that the answer is approximately 138 degrees.\n\nFinal check of the question and options.\nQuestion: What is the angle between the directions of the photons?\nOptions: A) 96, B) 74, C) 138, D) 172\nMy calculated answer is ~138 degrees, which matches option C.\n\nThe problem is solved. I will now output the final answer.\nThe problem requires the application of the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to the annihilation of an electron and a positron with given initial Lorentz factors.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total initial energy of the system. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\n*   Energy of the electron (E_e): With a Lorentz factor (γ_e) of 4 and rest mass (m_e), the energy is E_e = 4 * m_e * c².\n*   Energy of the positron (E_p): With a Lorentz factor (γ_p) of 2 and the same rest mass (m_e), the energy is E_p = 2 * m_e * c².\n*   Total initial energy (E_initial): E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4 * m_e * c² + 2 * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c².\n\nThis initial energy is completely converted into the energy of the two resulting photons. The problem states that the photons have the same energy (E_γ).\n\n*   Total final energy (E_final): E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ.\n\nBy the law of conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final.\n6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_γ\nTherefore, the energy of each photon is E_γ = 3 * m_e * c².\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nNext, we calculate the initial momentum of the system. The momentum (p) of a relativistic particle can be found using the energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². This gives pc = √(E² - (mc²)²) or p = √(γ² - 1)mc.\n\n*   Momentum of the electron (p_e): It moves from the left (positive direction) with γ_e = 4.\n    p_e = √(4² - 1) * m_e * c = √15 * m_e * c.\n*   Momentum of the positron (p_p): It moves from the right (negative direction) with γ_p = 2.\n    p_p = -√(2² - 1) * m_e * c = -√3 * m_e * c.\n*   Total initial momentum (P_initial): The total momentum is along the horizontal axis (x-axis).\n    P_initial_x = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3) * m_e * c.\n    The initial momentum in the vertical direction (y-axis) is zero.\n\nNow, we consider the final momentum of the two photons. For a photon, the momentum is p_γ = E_γ / c.\n*   Momentum of each photon: p_γ = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c.\n\nThe photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions. Due to the initial momentum being zero in the vertical direction, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. This means they are emitted at equal and opposite angles (θ and -θ) with respect to the horizontal axis.\n\n*   Total final momentum (P_final):\n    *   The horizontal component is P_final_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ).\n    *   The vertical component is P_final_y = p_γ * sin(θ) + p_γ * sin(-θ) = 0.\n\nBy the law of conservation of momentum, P_initial_x = P_final_x.\n(√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ)\n(√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n\nWe can solve for cos(θ):\ncos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\nUsing the approximate values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\ncos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\nθ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees.\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\nAngle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°.\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
