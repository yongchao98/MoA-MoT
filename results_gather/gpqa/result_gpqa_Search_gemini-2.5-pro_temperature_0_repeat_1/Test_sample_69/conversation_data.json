    "This chemical puzzle can be solved by systematically identifying each substance.\n\n1.  **Identify B, D, and H:** The fourth clue states that gas B and gas D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. A well-known industrial reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene (COCl₂) from carbon monoxide (CO) and chlorine (Cl₂). Phosgene is a liquid at room temperature and can be used as a solvent.\n    *   **B = CO (Carbon Monoxide)**\n    *   **D = Cl₂ (Chlorine)**\n    *   **H = COCl₂ (Phosgene)**\n\n2.  **Identify E:** The second clue states that product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (Cl₂) to produce the extremely hazardous product E. Phosgene is known to be an extremely hazardous and toxic gas. Given the reactants involved (a carbonyl complex C and chlorine D), it is highly plausible that the hazardous product E is also phosgene.\n    *   **E = COCl₂ (Phosgene)**\n\n3.  **Identify F and G:** The third clue describes the hydrolysis of C: C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). Since C is formed from A and B (CO), the hydrolysis of the carbonyl ligands (CO) would produce carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which is a weak acid. The strong acid, F, must therefore originate from component A.\n    *   **G = H₂CO₃ (Carbonic acid)**\n    *   **F = A strong acid**, likely HCl, meaning A is a chloride.\n\n4.  **Identify A and C:** The first clue states that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B (CO) to form the bright red product C. The hydrolysis of C must reform A. This suggests C is a carbonyl complex of A. While the exact identities of A and C are part of a complex puzzle, the identity of E can be determined with high confidence from the other clues.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:** The extremely hazardous product E has been identified as phosgene (COCl₂). To find its molecular symmetry group, we analyze its structure.\n    *   Phosgene has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    *   The molecule is planar, with a trigonal planar geometry around the central carbon atom.\n    *   It possesses a C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ): one is the plane containing all the atoms, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane and contains the C₂ axis.\n    *   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<B>>>"
