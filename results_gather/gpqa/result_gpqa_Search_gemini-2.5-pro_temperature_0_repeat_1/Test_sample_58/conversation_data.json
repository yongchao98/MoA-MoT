    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each substance:**\n\n*   **CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n*   **HCl (strong acid):**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n*   **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, it completely dissociates to produce two OH⁻ ions per formula unit: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻.\n    Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂).\n\n*   Initial moles of H⁺ (strong) = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH⁻ (strong) = 0.180 mol\n\nThe H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant in this step.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after reacting with HCl = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n\nThe CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant in this second neutralization.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ in excess after reacting with CH₃COOH = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\nAfter all reactions are complete, the solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻ ions, which will determine the pH.\n\n**3. Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n\nFirst, find the total volume of the mixed solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\nNow, calculate the final molarity of the excess OH⁻ ions.\n*   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n*   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**4. Calculate the pOH and then the pH:**\n\n*   **pOH = -log[OH⁻]**\n    pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n*   **pH = 14 - pOH**\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
