    "To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images. In this method, the grounded conducting sphere is replaced by an \"image charge\" that, along with the original charge `q`, reproduces the correct potential (zero) on the surface of the sphere.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`), an image charge, `q'`, is placed along the same line at a distance `d'` from the center, inside the sphere.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge is `d' = R²/d`.\n\n2.  **Interaction Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This energy is equivalent to the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. However, a crucial point in the method of images for calculating energy is that the potential energy of the system is half the interaction energy of the charge and its image. This is because the induced charge on the sphere is not a fixed entity but is created by the presence of the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity.\n\n3.  **Calculation**: The potential energy of interaction between the charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is given by Coulomb's potential energy formula:\n    `U_interaction = k * (q * q') / (distance between them)`\n\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) is `d - d' = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    *   Substituting the values of `q'` and the distance into the interaction energy formula:\n        `U_interaction = k * (q * [-qR/d]) / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n        `U_interaction = -k * (q²R/d) * [d / (d² - R²)]`\n        `U_interaction = -k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n4.  **Net Potential Energy**: As stated earlier, the net potential energy of the system is half of this interaction energy:\n    `U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
