    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy required for the diatomic molecule to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest possible energy state and then determine the momentum of a photon with that energy.\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Fundamental State (Initial State):** The lowest energy state for a molecule in the rotation-vibration model corresponds to the lowest vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. Therefore, the initial state is (v=0, J=0), where 'v' is the vibrational quantum number and 'J' is the rotational quantum number.\n*   **Next Lowest Energy State (Final State):** The transition is governed by quantum mechanical selection rules. For a rovibrational transition in a diatomic molecule, the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Starting from the initial state (v=0, J=0), the only allowed transition to a higher energy level is to the state (v=1, J=1). This corresponds to Δv = +1 and ΔJ = +1. This type of transition is known as the R-branch.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of a state in the rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\nE(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B·J(J+1)\nwhere:\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   ω is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   B is the rotational constant\n*   v and J are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, respectively\n\nThe energy of the transition (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial state energies:\n*   **Initial Energy (E_i):** E(0, 0) = (0 + 1/2)ħω + B·0(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **Final Energy (E_f):** E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B·1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   **Energy Difference (ΔE):** ΔE = E_f - E_i = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + 2B\n\nThe rotational constant B is defined as B = ħ² / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia is I = μR², with μ being the reduced mass of the molecule.\n\n### 3. Perform the Calculations\n\n**Given Values:**\n*   Mass of atom X (Mx): 20 amu\n*   Mass of atom Y (My): 2 amu\n*   Bond length (R): 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Angular frequency (ω): 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   1 amu = 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n*   Speed of light (c): 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n**Step-by-step Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Calculate the reduced mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\n    μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n2.  **Calculate the moment of inertia (I):**\n    I = μR² = (3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n3.  **Calculate the term 2B:**\n    2B = ħ² / I = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n    2B ≈ 9.208 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n4.  **Calculate the vibrational energy term (ħω):**\n    ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s)\n    ħω ≈ 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n5.  **Calculate the total transition energy (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = ħω + 2B = (4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.208 x 10⁻²³ J)\n    ΔE ≈ 4.2184 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    *(Note: The rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy.)*\n\n### 4. Calculate the Photon Momentum (p)\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum by the equation E = pc. Therefore, the momentum of the absorbed photon is:\np = ΔE / c\np = (4.2184 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.407 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value is very close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
