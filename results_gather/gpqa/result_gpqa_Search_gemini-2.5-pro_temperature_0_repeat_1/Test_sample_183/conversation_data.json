    "This is a multi-step synthesis problem that requires a careful analysis of the directing effects of various substituents on a benzene ring. The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the target molecule:\n*   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** is at position 1.\n*   A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** is at position 2.\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** is at position 3.\n\nThe key substituent relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe final step is almost certainly the formation of the ether from a phenol (a Williamson ether synthesis), meaning step (ix) `NaOH/EtBr` is the last step, and the precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The challenge is to synthesize this specific phenol isomer in high yield.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed reaction sequences:\n\n**Analysis of Option A:** This sequence starts by making p-tert-butylnitrobenzene, which is the major product of nitrating tert-butylbenzene. Subsequent steps lead to the formation of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol. Etherification of this compound would yield 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, which is an isomer of the desired product, but not the correct one. This pathway does not lead to the target molecule.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:** This sequence begins with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii), the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline, is problematic as the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards alkylation. This makes the proposed sequence inefficient and unlikely to proceed in high yield.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:** This sequence has an illogical order of reactions. For instance, it attempts diazotization (iv) before the formation of an amine (viii). This sequence is not chemically viable.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:** This sequence employs a more sophisticated strategy using a blocking group, which is often necessary for high-yield synthesis of specific isomers. Let's analyze the key steps:\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** This is the sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but strongly favors substitution at the sterically unhindered *para* position. This step forms **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**, effectively \"blocking\" the para position. This is a crucial step for controlling the position of the next substituent.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is the nitration of 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. The tert-butyl group directs *ortho* and the sulfonic acid group directs *meta*. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the tert-butyl group (position 2). This forces the formation of **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield. This intermediate correctly establishes the required *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups.\n4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **4-(tert-butyl)-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **The subsequent steps (vi, vii, viii)** in the option as written are confusing and likely contain a typographical error. However, the initial sequence (i-v) has successfully constructed a complex intermediate with the correct relative positioning of the key groups, which can then be converted to the desired phenol. A plausible continuation would involve replacing the diazonium salt with a hydroxyl group (hydrolysis, step vii) and then removing the sulfonic acid blocking group (desulfonation, step viii) to yield the required phenol precursor, which is then etherified (step ix).\n\nDespite the likely typo in the later steps, the initial strategy of using a sulfonic acid blocking group (steps i, ii, iii) is the most logical and effective way to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern in high yield. The other options lead to incorrect isomers or follow illogical pathways. Therefore, sequence B represents the most chemically sound approach.\n\n<<<B>>>"
