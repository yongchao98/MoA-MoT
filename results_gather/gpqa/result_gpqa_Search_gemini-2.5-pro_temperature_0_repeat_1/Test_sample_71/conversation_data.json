    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a norbornadiene derivative. Norbornadienes are excellent dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions due to their strained double bonds.\n*   **Reactant 2 & Reagent:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide (NaI). This combination of reagents is likely intended to generate a reactive diene in situ. While the name is somewhat unusual, it is structurally similar to other precursors that form *o*-xylylene (also known as *o*-quinodimethane), a highly reactive diene used in Diels-Alder reactions. We will assume the reaction generates a standard *o*-xylylene (C₈H₈).\n*   **Reaction:** A [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition occurs between the *o*-xylylene (the diene) and one of the double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative (the dienophile). This forms a complex polycyclic adduct, **Product 1**. The use of two equivalents of the diene precursor is likely to ensure the reaction proceeds to completion.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** Strong acid is used to cleave the tert-butyl ether. The 7-(tert-butoxy) group is hydrolyzed to a 7-hydroxy group (-OH), releasing isobutylene. **Product 2** is the alcohol corresponding to Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents:** SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild oxidation that converts the secondary alcohol at the C7 position into a ketone (C=O). **Product 3** is therefore a 7-keto derivative of the polycyclic adduct.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Condition:** Heating at 150°C.\n*   **Reaction:** This step involves a thermal fragmentation. The adduct formed in Step 1 can be viewed as a Diels-Alder product in two different ways:\n    1.  (*o*-xylylene) + (norbornadiene derivative)\n    2.  (cyclopentadiene derivative) + (1,4-dihydronaphthalene)\n*   Heating the 7-keto adduct (**Product 3**) initiates a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. While the reverse of the initial reaction is possible, the fragmentation via the second pathway is favored, especially because it leads to stable molecules.\n*   The fragmentation of Product 3 yields two molecules: cyclopentadienone (the 5-membered ring with the ketone) and **1,4-dihydronaphthalene**. The question asks for the final product, which is implied to be the stable organic molecule, **Product 4**.\n*   Therefore, **Product 4 is 1,4-dihydronaphthalene**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final step is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in 1,4-dihydronaphthalene.\n\nThe structure of 1,4-dihydronaphthalene consists of a benzene ring fused to a cyclohexene ring.\n\nLet's analyze its symmetry. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C double bond and the aromatic ring, as well as a C₂ rotational axis. This symmetry makes certain groups of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent.\n\nWe can identify four distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **Benzylic/Allylic Hydrogens:** The four hydrogens on the two CH₂ groups (at positions 1 and 4) are all chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.\n2.  **Olefinic (Vinylic) Hydrogens:** The two hydrogens on the C=C double bond (at positions 2 and 3) are equivalent to each other.\n3.  **Aromatic Hydrogens (ortho):** The two hydrogens on the aromatic ring directly attached to the fused ring system (at positions 5 and 8) are equivalent.\n4.  **Aromatic Hydrogens (meta):** The two hydrogens on the aromatic ring further from the fused ring system (at positions 6 and 7) are equivalent.\n\nCounting these distinct sets, we find there are **4** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-dihydronaphthalene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
