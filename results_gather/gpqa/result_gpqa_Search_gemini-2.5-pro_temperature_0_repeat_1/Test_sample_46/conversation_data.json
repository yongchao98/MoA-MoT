    "The provided data allows for a clear identification of the compound. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are highly characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is typical for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with an α,β-unsaturated ester, where the carbonyl is conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH2-). Together, the triplet and quartet strongly suggest an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) present as an ethoxy moiety.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to quadripole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2 group). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n**4. Structure Determination:**\nAssembling the identified fragments:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPlacing these groups in a para arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data and the molecular formula (C9H11NO2).\n\n**5. Evaluation of Other Options:**\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H band in the IR. It would also have a signal for a formyl proton (-CHO) in the NMR, which is absent.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this isomer, the methylene group of the ethyl fragment would be adjacent to the carbonyl, not the ester oxygen, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the data conclusively identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
