    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n\nThis reaction is the acid-catalyzed α-bromination of a ketone. One of the α-hydrogens on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n\nWhen an α-halo ketone is treated with a base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. In this specific case, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming product 3.**\n\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol.\n\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde):**\n\nTo count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to look at the symmetry of the molecule. Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the carbon of the ring it is attached to (C1).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is unique. (1 type)\n2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring directly bonded to the aldehyde group is also in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The two carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5) are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic—one is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. Therefore, they are chemically distinct from each other. This gives two more types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** The next two carbons in the ring (C3 and C4) are also equivalent to each other because of the symmetry plane. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This accounts for another two types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nTotaling these up: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
