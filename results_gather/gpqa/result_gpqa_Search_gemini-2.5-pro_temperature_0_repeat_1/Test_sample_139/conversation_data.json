    "Based on a step-by-step analysis of the provided chemical clues, the unknown substances have been identified:\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)\n*   **Liquid Y:** Heavy Water (D₂O)\n*   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D₂)\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)\n*   **Substance B:** Heavy Water (D₂O)\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X, which is LiAlD₄.\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Determine the lightest and heaviest elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n3.  **Find the relevant isotopes and their masses:**\n    *   The problem specifies that Substance X contains a heavier isotope. In LiAlD₄, hydrogen is present as its heavier stable isotope, Deuterium (²H or D). There are four atoms of Deuterium. The atomic mass of a single Deuterium atom is approximately 2.014 Da.\n    *   Aluminum's only stable isotope is Aluminum-27 (²⁷Al). There is one atom of Aluminum in the molecule. The atomic mass of an Aluminum-27 atom is approximately 26.982 Da.\n4.  **Calculate the cumulative masses:** The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium):** 4 × 2.014 Da = 8.056 Da\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** 1 × 26.982 Da = 26.982 Da\n    *   **Total cumulative mass:** 8.056 Da + 26.982 Da = 35.038 Da\n\nThe calculated value of 35.038 is closest to the integer 35.\n\n<<<A>>>"
