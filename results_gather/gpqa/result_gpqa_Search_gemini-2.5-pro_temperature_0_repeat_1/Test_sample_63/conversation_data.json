    "The initial analysis appears to be correct. The search results confirm the decomposition products and reactions that were hypothesized.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) Decomposition:** The thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrite produces nitrogen gas (N₂) and water (H₂O). The reaction is: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) Decomposition:** The decomposition of ammonium nitrate is more complex and depends on the temperature. At temperatures around 200-250°C, the primary products are nitrous oxide (N₂O) and water (H₂O). However, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, it can decompose to produce nitrogen (N₂), oxygen (O₂), and water (H₂O). The problem specifies that O₂ was produced and passed over hot copper, and a final inert gas (deduced as N₂) remained. This indicates that the decomposition path producing O₂ and N₂ occurred: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O.\n\nThe step-by-step chemical analysis based on the products formed is sound.\n\n1.  **Water (H₂O):** The mass increase of 3.60 g in the tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂ corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Oxygen (O₂):** The mass increase of 0.80 g in the tube with red-hot copper is due to the formation of CuO from O₂.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n3.  **Gas C (N₂):** The remaining 2.24 liters of gas at STP is the inert component.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. This gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n4.  **Salts Identification:** The products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) strongly suggest the decomposition of ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen. The two salts that fit this description and the stoichiometry are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n5.  **Stoichiometric Verification:**\n    *   Let 'n' be the number of moles for each salt (equimolar mixture).\n    *   Reaction A: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n    *   Reaction B: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃: (n/2) moles of O₂, n moles of N₂, and 2n moles of H₂O are produced.\n    *   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂: n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O are produced.\n    *   Total moles of O₂ = n/2 = 0.025 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = n + n = 2n = 0.1 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n = 0.2 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The calculated moles (n=0.05) are consistent for all products.\n\n6.  **Mass Verification:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = 0.05 mol * (80.04 g/mol + 64.04 g/mol) = 0.05 * 144.08 = 7.204 g. This matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Salt A is NH₄NO₃, which has 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Salt B is NH₄NO₂, which has 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   The total number of atoms in both salts is 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe result is consistent and verified.\n\n<<<A>>>"
