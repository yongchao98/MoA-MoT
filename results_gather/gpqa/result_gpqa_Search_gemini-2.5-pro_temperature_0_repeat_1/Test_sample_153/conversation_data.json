    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified white solid is determined to be **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectral Data**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound with the chlorine-35 isotope.\n    *   The peak at **m/z = 158** with an intensity of approximately one-third (32%) of the molecular ion peak is the characteristic M+2 isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of the chlorine-37 isotope).\n    *   This data is consistent with the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad peak observed from **3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at **11.0 ppm** with an integration of 1H is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its significant downfield shift is due to deshielding.\n    *   The two signals in the aromatic region, a doublet at **8.02 ppm (2H)** and another doublet at **7.72 ppm (2H)**, strongly suggest a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. This substitution pattern creates chemical equivalence for the two protons on each side of the ring, resulting in two distinct sets of protons that split each other into doublets.\n\n### **Evaluation of Potential Structures**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure would not produce a simple two-doublet pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum due to its *ortho* substitution, which would result in four unique aromatic proton signals.\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This compound lacks a carboxylic acid, which contradicts both the IR and ¹H NMR data.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule does not have a carboxylic acid O-H group, which is inconsistent with the broad peak in the IR spectrum and the proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure perfectly matches all the provided data. It contains a chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid functional group, and a *para*-substituted aromatic ring, which accounts for all the features observed in the MS, IR, and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n<<<D>>>"
