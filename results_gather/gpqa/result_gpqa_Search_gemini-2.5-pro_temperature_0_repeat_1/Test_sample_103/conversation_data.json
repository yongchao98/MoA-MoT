    "The search results confirm my reasoning.\n\n1.  **Formula Confirmation**: The radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is indeed given by a formula that is proportional to `(m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))`. This confirms the relationship `K ∝ (m_p * sin(i)) / P^(1/3)` when the star's mass is constant.\n\n2.  **Mass Interpretation**: The search results strongly support the interpretation that for planets detected via the radial velocity method, the \"mass\" commonly referred to is the *minimum mass* (`m_p * sin(i)`). This is because the orbital inclination `i` is generally unknown. Therefore, the problem's statement that the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\" should be interpreted as `m_p1 * sin(i1) ≈ m_p2 * sin(i2)`.\n\nWith these confirmations, the initial derivation is sound.\n\n**Final check of the calculation:**\n- K2 / K1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n- K2 / K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n- 1.4 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n- (1.4)^3 = P1 / P2\n- 2.744 = P1 / P2\n- P2 / P1 = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe result matches option A.\n\nThe problem is self-contained and the solution is derived from fundamental principles of the radial velocity method. The key is the correct interpretation of the term \"mass\" in this context.\n\nFinal answer is A.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the final response structure:\n1.  Start by explaining the relationship between the observed wavelength shift and the star's radial velocity.\n2.  State the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n3.  Explain that for the radial velocity method, the measured mass is the minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`.\n4.  Set up the ratio of the two systems (K2/K1).\n5.  Substitute the known values and the simplifying assumptions (same stellar mass, same minimum planet mass).\n6.  Solve for the ratio of the periods (P2/P1).\n7.  State the final answer.Based on the principles of the radial velocity method for exoplanet detection, the ratio of the orbital periods can be determined from the information provided.\n\nThe periodic shift in a star's spectral lines is a direct result of the star's radial velocity, which is the component of its velocity along our line of sight. This \"wobble\" is caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\nwhere:\n*   P is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n*   Mₛ is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\nA crucial point in the radial velocity method is that it cannot determine the planet's true mass (mₚ) and the orbital inclination (i) separately. It can only determine the product `mₚ sin(i)`, which is known as the planet's \"minimum mass\". Therefore, the statement that both planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\" implies that their minimum masses are similar:\nmₚ₁ sin(i₁) ≈ mₚ₂ sin(i₂)\n\nWe can now find the ratio of the orbital periods by setting up a ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\nK₂ / K₁ = [ (2πG / P₂)^(1/3) * (mₚ₂ sin(i₂) / Mₛ₂^(2/3)) ] / [ (2πG / P₁)^(1/3) * (mₚ₁ sin(i₁) / Mₛ₁^(2/3)) ]\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the stars have the same masses (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂), and as we've established, the planets have similar minimum masses (mₚ₁ sin(i₁) ≈ mₚ₂ sin(i₂)). With these conditions, the terms for mass and the constants cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\nK₂ / K₁ = (1 / P₂)^(1/3) / (1 / P₁)^(1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can substitute the known value of K₂ / K₁ and solve for the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁):\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo solve for the period ratio, we cube both sides of the equation:\n(1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nFinally, we find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1:\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>"
