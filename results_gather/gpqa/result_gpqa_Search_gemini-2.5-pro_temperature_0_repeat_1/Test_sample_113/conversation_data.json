    "For the first reaction, the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is a cyanohydrin formation. This reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (from NaCN) to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This creates a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate, which is then protonated to yield the final cyanohydrin product. A proton source is required for this second step. A strong acid, represented as H3O+, is a suitable reagent for this protonation.\n\nFor the second reaction, the conversion of a nitrile (2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile) to a carboxylic acid (2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid) is a hydrolysis reaction. This transformation can be achieved under either acidic or basic conditions. When performed under acidic conditions, the nitrile is typically heated with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid, in the presence of water. The strong acid catalyzes the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid group. While a weak acid like acetic acid (CH3COOH) could be used, a strong acid like HCl is generally more effective for ensuring the complete conversion to the carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the suitable reagents are:\n*   **A = H3O+** for the cyanohydrin formation.\n*   **B = HCl** for the hydrolysis of the nitrile.\n\n<<<B>>>"
