    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Define the initial state and operators**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n|ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\nThe operator for the observable P is:\nP = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nThe operator for the observable Q is:\nQ = `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n**2. Normalize the initial state**\n\nFirst, we need to find the squared norm of the initial state vector `|ψ⟩`:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = `[-1, 2, 1]` * `[[-1], [2], [1]]` = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\n\nThe normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is `(1/√6) * |ψ⟩`.\n\n**3. First Measurement: P = 0**\n\nWe need to find the probability of measuring the observable P and obtaining the value 0. This requires finding the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvalues of P:** The eigenvalues `p` are found by solving `det(P - pI) = 0`.\n    `det([[ -p, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -p, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -p]]) = -p(p² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-p/√2) = -p³ + p/2 + p/2 = -p³ + p = p(1 - p²) = 0`\n    The eigenvalues are p = 0, p = 1, and p = -1.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for p = 0:** We solve the equation `(P - 0I)|p=0⟩ = 0`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [[x], [y], [z]] = [[0], [0], [0]]`\n    This gives us `y/√2 = 0` (so `y=0`) and `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` (so `x = -z`).\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[[1], [0], [-1]]`.\n    The normalized eigenvector `|p=0⟩` is `(1/√2) * [[1], [0], [-1]]`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P = 0:** The probability is given by `|⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n    `⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) * ( (1/√6) * [[-1], [2], [1]] )`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n    The probability `Prob(P=0)` is `| -1/√3 |² = 1/3`.\n\n**4. State collapse after the first measurement**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector:\n|ψ'⟩ = |p=0⟩ = `(1/√2) * [[1], [0], [-1]]`\n\n**5. Second Measurement: Q = -1**\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. We need to find the probability of obtaining the value -1.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for Q = -1:** The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue q = -1 is:\n    |q=-1⟩ = `[[0], [0], [1]]`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q = -1:** The probability is given by `|⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩|²`.\n    `⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] * ( (1/√2) * [[1], [0], [-1]] )`\n    `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`\n    The probability `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)` is `| -1/√2 |² = 1/2`.\n\n**6. Calculate the total probability**\n\nThe probability of the sequence of events (getting P=0 and then Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n\nTotal Probability = `Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\nTotal Probability = `(1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
