    "This problem can be solved using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and the law of radioactive decay.\n\nThe fraction of particles, N/N₀, that survive after a time *t* is given by the exponential decay formula:\n\nN/N₀ = e<sup>-(t/τ)</sup>\n\nwhere:\n*   N is the number of particles remaining.\n*   N₀ is the initial number of particles.\n*   t is the time elapsed in the laboratory frame.\n*   τ is the lifetime of the particles in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe lifetime of the particles is affected by time dilation, as they are moving at relativistic speeds. The lifetime in the lab frame (τ) is related to their proper lifetime (τ₀, their lifetime in their own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nτ = γ * τ₀\n\nThe time *t* it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall is the radius of the detector (R) divided by the particle's velocity (v). Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity is approximately the speed of light (c).\n\nt ≈ R/c\n\nCombining these equations, the survival fraction is:\n\nN/N₀ = e<sup>-((R/c)/(γ*τ₀))</sup>\n\nWe can now apply this to the two scenarios given in the problem.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n\n*   Survival fraction = 1/3\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁) = 20\n\n1/3 = e<sup>-((R/c)/(20*τ₀))</sup>\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = - (R/c) / (20 * τ₀)\n-ln(3) = - (R/c) / (20 * τ₀)\n(R/c) / τ₀ = 20 * ln(3)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\n*   Survival fraction = 2/3\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂).\n\n2/3 = e<sup>-((R/c)/(γ₂*τ₀))</sup>\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = - (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)\n-ln(3/2) = - (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)\nln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)\n\nNow we have two expressions for the constant term (R/c)/τ₀, so we can set them equal to each other:\n\nγ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)\n\nSolving for γ₂:\n\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931)\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
