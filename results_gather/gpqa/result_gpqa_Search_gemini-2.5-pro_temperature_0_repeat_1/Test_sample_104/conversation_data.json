    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Scenario\n\nWe have a star with two distinct hemispheres:\n*   **Hemisphere 1 (Unspotted):** Has a uniform temperature, T_star = 6000 K.\n*   **Hemisphere 2 (Spotted):** Is partially covered by cooler, dark spots.\n    *   The temperature of the spots is T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n    *   The spots cover 20% of this hemisphere's surface (filling factor, f = 0.2). The remaining 80% is at the star's normal temperature of 6000 K.\n\nAs the star rotates, we observe it from a fixed direction. The maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces us, and the minimum brightness occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces us. The \"amplitude\" of this variation is the relative difference in brightness between these two states.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Flux from Each Hemisphere\n\nThe flux (energy per unit area) emitted by a surface is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.\n\n*   **Flux from the unspotted hemisphere (F_max):**\n    The entire visible disk has a temperature of 6000 K. The total flux is proportional to the area of the disk (A) times the flux per unit area.\n    F_max ∝ A * σ * (6000 K)⁴\n\n*   **Flux from the spotted hemisphere (F_min):**\n    When this hemisphere faces us, 20% of the visible disk is at 5000 K and 80% is at 6000 K.\n    F_min ∝ [ (0.8 * A) * σ * (6000 K)⁴ ] + [ (0.2 * A) * σ * (5000 K)⁴ ]\n\n### 3. Calculate the Amplitude of the Light Curve Variation\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in flux from maximum to minimum.\n\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nLet's substitute the expressions from Step 2 (we can cancel out the common terms A and σ):\n\nAmplitude = [ (6000)⁴ - (0.8 * 6000⁴ + 0.2 * 5000⁴) ] / (6000)⁴\nAmplitude = [ (1 - 0.8) * 6000⁴ - 0.2 * 5000⁴ ] / 6000⁴\nAmplitude = [ 0.2 * 6000⁴ - 0.2 * 5000⁴ ] / 6000⁴\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [ 1 - (5000⁴ / 6000⁴) ]\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\n\nNow, we calculate the value:\n(5/6)⁴ ≈ (0.8333)⁴ ≈ 0.4823\nAmplitude ≈ 0.2 * (1 - 0.4823)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.2 * 0.5177\n**Amplitude ≈ 0.1035**\n\nSo, the star's brightness drops by about 10.35% due to the spotted hemisphere.\n\n### 4. Relate the Amplitude to an Exoplanet Transit\n\nWe need to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness drop on an unspotted star. When an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The depth of this transit (the relative drop in brightness) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's disk area.\n\nTransit Depth = (Area of Planet) / (Area of Star)\nTransit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\nTransit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n### 5. Solve for the Relative Planet Radius\n\nWe set the transit depth equal to the amplitude calculated from the starspots.\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.1035\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star) by taking the square root:\n\nR_pl / R_star ≈ √0.1035\n**R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3217**\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
