    "The self-metathesis of a terminal alkene like 3-methylpent-1-ene, when treated with a Grubbs catalyst, results in the formation of ethene and a new internal alkene. The starting material is a racemic mixture, which means it contains equal amounts of two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\nThe reaction can occur in three different ways:\n1.  Two molecules of (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene react with each other.\n2.  Two molecules of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene react with each other.\n3.  One molecule of (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene reacts with one molecule of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\nIn each case, the product (excluding ethene) is 4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene. However, the stereochemistry of this product depends on the stereochemistry of the reactants. The newly formed double bond can also have two different configurations, E (trans) or Z (cis).\n\nLet's analyze the products from each reaction:\n\n*   **Reaction of (S) + (S):** This reaction produces (S,S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene. Since the new double bond can be either E or Z, two stereoisomers are formed: (E)-(4S,5S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene and (Z)-(4S,5S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\n*   **Reaction of (R) + (R):** This reaction produces (R,R)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene. Again, two stereoisomers are possible due to the E/Z isomerism of the double bond: (E)-(4R,5R)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene and (Z)-(4R,5R)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene. The (E)-(R,R) product is the enantiomer (non-superimposable mirror image) of the (E)-(S,S) product. Similarly, the (Z)-(R,R) product is the enantiomer of the (Z)-(S,S) product.\n\n*   **Reaction of (R) + (S):** This cross-metathesis reaction produces (R,S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene. This combination results in meso compounds, which are achiral despite having chiral centers. Two diastereomeric meso compounds are formed, corresponding to the E and Z configurations of the double bond: (E)-(4R,5S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene and (Z)-(4R,5S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\nIn total, we have:\n1.  (E)-(S,S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene\n2.  (Z)-(S,S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene\n3.  (E)-(R,R)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene\n4.  (Z)-(R,R)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene\n5.  (E)-(R,S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n6.  (Z)-(R,S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n\nAll six of these molecules are distinct stereoisomers. Therefore, there are 6 possible products, excluding ethene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
