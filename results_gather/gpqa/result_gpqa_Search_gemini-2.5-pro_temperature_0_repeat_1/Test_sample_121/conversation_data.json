    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n### **Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    Acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine. This reaction is an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, where the α-hydrogen is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Reactant:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH)\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Reactant:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Reactant:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   The hydrogens on the carbon between the nitrile (-CN) and the ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) are acidic. NaH, a strong base, deprotonates this carbon twice due to being in excess.\n    *   The resulting dianion undergoes a double alkylation with 1,5-dibromopentane. The first alkylation is intermolecular, and the second is an intramolecular cyclization, forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, which requires considering diastereotopicity, even in achiral molecules.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is:\n*   A cyclohexane ring.\n*   A cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃) are attached to carbon-1 (C1) of the ring.\n\nAt room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair flipping. This rapid interconversion creates an averaged structure with a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, and the two substituents on C1.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-CH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. They will appear as one signal (a triplet). **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH₂-) are equivalent to each other (enantiotopic) and will appear as one signal (a quartet). **(1 signal)**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5. C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two geminal protons on C2 are diastereotopic because replacing them one at a time with another group would create diastereomers. The same applies to C6. Due to the plane of symmetry, the two signals from the C2 protons are equivalent to the two signals from the C6 protons. Thus, the four protons on C2 and C6 give rise to **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The four protons on C3 and C5 also give rise to **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two geminal protons on C4 are also diastereotopic. This is because one is *cis* to the substituents on C1 and the other is *trans* within the ring's three-dimensional structure, even with rapid flipping. This results in **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding up all the distinct proton environments:\n*   Ethyl group: 2 signals\n*   Cyclohexane ring: 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 6 signals\n\nTotal = 2 + 6 = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
