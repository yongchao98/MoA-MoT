    "The less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY) compared to Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) are primarily due to the process of X-chromosome inactivation. In mammals with more than one X chromosome, a mechanism exists to equalize the expression of X-linked genes with that of XY males. This process, which occurs early in embryonic (post-zygotic) development, transcriptionally silences most of the genes on all but one X chromosome.\n\nIn individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome, one of the two X chromosomes is largely inactivated, forming a condensed structure known as a Barr body. This inactivation is achieved through epigenetic modifications, including the methylation of chromatin by enzymes such as histone methyltransferases. This mechanism compensates for the extra chromosome by silencing the majority of its genes, thus mitigating the effects of the gene dosage imbalance.\n\nHowever, not all genes on the extra X chromosome are inactivated; about 15% escape this silencing process, and their expression contributes to the specific features of Klinefelter's syndrome.\n\nIn contrast, there is no equivalent large-scale inactivation mechanism for an entire autosome like chromosome 21. Therefore, individuals with Down's syndrome have three active copies of chromosome 21, leading to a more significant and widespread overexpression of genes, which results in the more severe and distinct phenotypic consequences associated with the syndrome.\n\n<<<D>>>"
