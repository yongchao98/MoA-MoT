    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence and Identification of Products\n\n1.  **Product 1 Formation:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with strong base (KOH) at high temperature. The analytical data provided for Product 1 is contradictory: an IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a ketone, while a ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests vinylic protons (an alkene). This contradiction suggests either an error in the problem statement or a very unusual structure. However, the subsequent reaction steps provide clues to backtrack the structures.\n\n2.  **Product 2 Formation:** Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of ketones to alcohols.\n\n3.  **Product 3 Formation:** Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ followed by DMS). Ozonolysis is a reaction that cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This is a critical piece of information, as it implies that **Product 2 must be an alkene**.\n\nLet's work backward from this key fact.\n\n*   If **Product 2** is an alkene, it must have been formed from **Product 1**. The reaction of a ketone (suggested by the IR of Product 1) with aluminum isopropoxide (MPV reduction) yields an alcohol. This alcohol would then need to be dehydrated to form the alkene (Product 2). This two-step process (reduction then dehydration) can sometimes occur in one pot under heating. Dehydration of adamantan-2-ol (formed from the reduction of adamantan-2-one) is known to cause a rearrangement to form a more stable, less strained alkene. The most plausible C₁₀H₁₄ alkene formed is **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0'3,8']dec-4-ene).\n*   This implies that **Product 1** is likely **adamantan-2-one**. The formation of adamantan-2-one from 1,3-dibromoadamantane under these conditions is a known, albeit complex, transformation involving hydrolysis and rearrangement. We will proceed by assuming the IR data (1720 cm⁻¹) is correct and the provided NMR data for Product 1 is erroneous or misleading.\n\nSo, the most plausible reaction sequence is:\n*   **Product 1:** Adamantan-2-one\n*   **Product 2:** Protoadamantene (formed via reduction of Product 1 to adamantan-2-ol, followed by rearrangement and dehydration)\n*   **Product 3:** The product of the ozonolysis of protoadamantene.\n\n### Step 2: Determining the Structure of Product 3\n\nOzonolysis of protoadamantene (a C₁₀H₁₄ alkene) with a reductive workup (DMS) will cleave the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. The reaction results in a C₁₀H₁₄O₂ dicarbonyl compound. The specific product formed from the cleavage of the double bond in the protoadamantane ring system is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carbaldehyde-7-one**.\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core, which typically adopts a dual chair conformation. It has a ketone group at the C7 position and an aldehyde group at the C3 position.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C3, C7, and the two carbonyl groups.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\nWe need to identify the most deshielded hydrogen atom on the carbon skeleton of Product 3 and determine its coupling pattern.\n\n1.  **Most Deshielded Proton:** In this structure, there are several types of protons. The aldehyde proton (-CHO) would be the most deshielded overall (typically 9-10 ppm). However, among the protons attached to the bicyclic ring, the one most affected by the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups will be the most deshielded. The proton at the C3 position (H3), being on the same carbon as the aldehyde group (alpha to the carbonyl), is the most deshielded proton on the ring framework.\n\n2.  **Coupling Pattern of H3:** To determine the splitting pattern of H3, we must look at its neighboring protons.\n    *   H3 is located on a carbon (C3) that is bonded to C2 and C4.\n    *   Each of these carbons (C2 and C4) has two protons: an axial one and an equatorial one (H2ax, H2eq, H4ax, H4eq).\n    *   Therefore, H3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the rigid chair-like conformation of the ring, the coupling constants between H3 and its axial and equatorial neighbors will be different.\n        *   The coupling to the two axial protons (H2ax and H4ax) will have a large coupling constant (J_ax). Due to symmetry, J(H3-H2ax) ≈ J(H3-H4ax).\n        *   The coupling to the two equatorial protons (H2eq and H4eq) will have a small coupling constant (J_eq). Due to symmetry, J(H3-H2eq) ≈ J(H3-H4eq).\n    *   A proton coupled to two equivalent protons gives a triplet.\n    *   Since H3 is coupled to two axial protons with one coupling constant (J_ax) and two equatorial protons with another coupling constant (J_eq), its signal will be split into a triplet by the axial protons, and each line of that triplet will be further split into another triplet by the equatorial protons.\n\nThis splitting pattern is described as a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n<<<B>>>"
