    "To determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation reaction of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5x10¹⁰\n\nThe problem asks for the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. This means we need to consider the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\nNow, we can set up an equilibrium table to find the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates from the complex.\n\n| Species | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n2x10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nSince the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant is very small. This implies that the dissociation of the complex is minimal, and therefore 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can thus approximate (0.02 - x) as 0.02 to simplify the calculation.\n\n2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\nx ≈ √(4x10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions at equilibrium is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M. This value is indeed much smaller than 0.02, confirming that our approximation was valid.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1.0x10⁻² M\nB) 2.0x10⁻² M\nC) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nD) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
