    "To solve this problem, we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to the decay of the stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν).\n\nThe decay process is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\n**Given:**\n*   The π⁺ is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The rest mass of the neutrino (m_ν) is considered to be zero.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles, the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν), must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum 'p'.\n\n|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest energy.\n    E_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n\n    The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic equation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc²\n    *   For the neutrino (ν), with zero rest mass: E_ν = |p_ν|c = pc. The neutrino's total energy is its kinetic energy (KE_ν).\n\n*   **Applying Conservation:**\n    m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n    m_πc² = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² ) + pc\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nWe can solve for the momentum (p) first. Rearranging the energy conservation equation:\nm_πc² - pc = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )\n\nSquaring both sides:\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nThe (pc)² terms cancel out. Solving for pc:\npc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\npc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\npc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n**4. Finding the Kinetic Energies:**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    As the neutrino is considered massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n    KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    The total energy of the muon can be found from the initial energy conservation equation:\n    E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν\n    E_μ = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV\n\n    The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy.\n    KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\n    KE_μ = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n    KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.\n\n<<<A>>>"
