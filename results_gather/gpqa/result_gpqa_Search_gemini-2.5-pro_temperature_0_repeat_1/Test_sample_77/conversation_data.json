    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe scalar potential V and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time t are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$. This is the time at which the electromagnetic field must have been generated to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time t, traveling at the speed of light c.\n\nThe correct formulas are derived from Maxwell's equations and are given as follows:\n\nThe scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe vector potential is:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nIn these expressions, all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The vector $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$, and $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at that same retarded time.\n\nIt is also a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential V by the velocity of the charge $\\vec{v}$ and the speed of light c:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n\nComparing these standard forms with the given options, option D correctly represents both the scalar and vector potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>"
