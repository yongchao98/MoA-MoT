    "The relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its orbital characteristics is crucial for solving this problem. The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates back into space. This temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance (a) from the star.\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion, the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), which for a circular orbit is its distance from the star (P² ∝ a³). This means that the distance 'a' is proportional to the orbital period 'P' raised to the power of 2/3 (a ∝ P^(2/3)).\n\nBy combining these two principles, we can establish a direct relationship between the equilibrium temperature and the orbital period. Since the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the distance (T_eq ∝ 1/√a), and the distance is proportional to the orbital period to the power of 2/3, it follows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period (T_eq ∝ 1/P^(1/3)).\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can set up the following proportion:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\nGiven the ratio of the orbital periods is 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5, we can assign the corresponding values to the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n*   P_2 = 2 (in relative units)\n*   P_4 = 3.5 (in relative units)\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\nRatio = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nRatio = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\nRatio ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the cube root of approximately 0.5714 gives a value of about 0.83.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet\\_4 and Planet\\_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
