    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a syn-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. When the starting alkene is (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene), this syn-addition results in a trans-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the product is a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The epoxide ring is then opened by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an Sₙ2-like reaction where water acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the oxygen atom (anti-addition).\n    *   The anti-addition of water to the racemic mixture of trans-epoxides results in a single, achiral meso-compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This compound has a plane of symmetry and is therefore not optically active.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The syn-addition of mCPBA to (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) produces a cis-epoxide. This specific cis-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, is a meso-compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this meso-epoxide also proceeds via anti-addition of water.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the meso-epoxide yields (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon yields (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   These two products are enantiomers of each other. Since the attack at either carbon is equally probable, a racemic mixture of the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols is formed.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nAfter combining the products from both reactions, the final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso-compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-compound is a diastereomer to both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are enantiomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** Standard HPLC columns use an achiral stationary phase. Such columns can separate compounds with different physical properties, like diastereomers. However, they cannot distinguish between enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   The meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair because they are diastereomers.\n    *   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** Chiral HPLC columns use a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers. The chiral environment of the column causes the two enantiomers to interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   The column will separate the meso-compound from the enantiomers (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   The column will also separate the (4R,5R) enantiomer from the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, the chemist will observe **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct observation is 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
