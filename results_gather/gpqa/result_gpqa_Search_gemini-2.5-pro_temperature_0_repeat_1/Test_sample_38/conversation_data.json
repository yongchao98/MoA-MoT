    "To determine the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition of the wave function. The probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\nThe probability density, which gives the probability of finding the particle at a specific position, is the square of the modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|².\n\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe modulus squared of this complex wave function is the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts:\n|ψ(x)|² = (Re(ψ))² + (Im(ψ))²\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / √(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nWe are told that the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. This means we must normalize the wave function over this interval. The integral of the probability density over this interval must be equal to 1.\n\n∫¹³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integral:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\n= a² [ln(1 + x)] + [0.25x]\n\nNext, we evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n[a² ln(1 + 3) + 0.25(3)] - [a² ln(1 + 1) + 0.25(1)] = 1\n[a² ln(4) + 0.75] - [a² ln(2) + 0.25] = 1\n\nNow, we simplify and solve for \"a\":\na² (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.75 - 0.25 = 1\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\na² ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\na² ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2, ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\na ≈ √0.7215\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
