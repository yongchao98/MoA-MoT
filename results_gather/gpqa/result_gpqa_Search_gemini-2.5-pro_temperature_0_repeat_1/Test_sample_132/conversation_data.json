    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the components**\nThe solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O). In water, these salts dissociate into their respective ions:\n*   KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate)\n*   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate) + 2H₂O\n\nThe H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions form a buffer system, which is governed by the second dissociation constant (Ka₂) of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄).\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of each salt**\nFirst, we determine the number of moles for each salt from their given masses and molar masses.\n*   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the initial concentrations**\nNext, we find the initial molar concentrations of the H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions in the 200.00 cm³ (0.20000 L) solution.\n*   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**4. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]**\nThe buffer system is based on the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, which involves H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n*   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   Equilibrium constant: Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n\nWe can rearrange the Ka₂ expression to solve for the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**5. Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is produced in the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid.\n*   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   Equilibrium constant: Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\nWe rearrange the Ka₃ expression to solve for the orthophosphate concentration [PO₄³⁻]:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<D>>>"
