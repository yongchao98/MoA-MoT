    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes a planet with the same characteristics as Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as about 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition, a significant increase in mass leads to greater gravitational compression of its materials. This internal compression results in a higher overall density. Therefore, a planet that is 5 times more massive than Earth, but made of the same \"stuff,\" will be denser than Earth.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with less mass will experience weaker gravitational compression. As a result, a planet with half the mass of Earth but the same composition will be less dense than Earth.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) will have a density significantly greater than 5.5 g/cm³ due to increased gravitational compression.\n*   Planet (d) will have a density less than 5.5 g/cm³.\n\nBased on this analysis, the planet described in option (c) will have the highest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
