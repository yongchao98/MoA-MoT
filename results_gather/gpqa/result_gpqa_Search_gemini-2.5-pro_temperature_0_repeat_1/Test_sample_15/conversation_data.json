    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is typically due to the presence of one or more chiral centers. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a double bond, and the atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name of this compound specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer using the (3aR,7aS) designation. This indicates the presence of chiral centers and that we are considering a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule possesses two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such a compound is called a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers and is thus optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This stereoisomer of dimethylsuccinic acid is a chiral molecule. It is the enantiomer of the (2S,3S) form and does not have an internal plane of symmetry. As a specific enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups (a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon pathways within the ring), making it a chiral center. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer and therefore optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this molecule, all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** To determine if this molecule is chiral, we look for chiral centers. The structure is (CH₃)₂CHCH₂C(=O)C₅H₉. The carbon atom in the `CH` group is bonded to two identical methyl (CH₃) groups, so it is not a chiral center. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule, and it lacks any other elements of chirality, making it optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
