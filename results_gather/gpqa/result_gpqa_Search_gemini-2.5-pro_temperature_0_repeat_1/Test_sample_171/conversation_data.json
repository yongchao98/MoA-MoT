    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars.\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. Let N₂ and N₁ be the number of atoms in a higher energy level (excited state) and a lower energy level (ground state), respectively. The equation is:\n\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    where:\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the respective energy levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Stars**: We can write the Boltzmann equation for the specific energy level of iron in each star. Let the ratio of the population in the excited state to the ground state be R.\n\n    *   For star 1, with effective temperature T₁:\n        R₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\n    *   For star 2, with effective temperature T₂:\n        R₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information**: The problem states that the iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited as in star 2. This means the ratio of the populations in the excited state for star 1 is double that of star 2.\n\n    R₁ = 2 * R₂\n\n    Substituting the expressions from the Boltzmann equation:\n\n    (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Equation**: The term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) is the same for both stars and cancels out.\n\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n    Now, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\n    Using the properties of logarithms (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(eˣ) = x):\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\n5.  **Isolating the Temperature Terms**: Rearrange the equation to group the temperature terms on one side.\n\n    ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term ΔE / k:\n\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions within the parenthesis:\n\n    (ΔE / k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)] = ln(2)\n\n6.  **Substituting the Given Values**: The problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is also approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is:\n\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    Substituting this value back into our equation:\n\n    1 * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)] = ln(2)\n\n    This simplifies to:\n\n    ln(2) = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
