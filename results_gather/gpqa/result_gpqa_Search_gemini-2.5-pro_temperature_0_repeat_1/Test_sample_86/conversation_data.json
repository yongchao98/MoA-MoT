    "To solve this problem, we must first deduce the structure of the compound from the given information and then match it to the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n### **1. Structural Analysis**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached (a C6H4- group).\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n*   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** The second substituent must contain the remaining two carbon atoms and a carbonyl group.\n\nBased on these facts, the only possible structure for the second substituent is an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH3. This gives the molecule the general structure of a haloacetophenone. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\nThe protons in this molecule are:\n*   Four aromatic protons on the C6H4 ring.\n*   Three methyl protons on the -COCH3 group.\n\n### **2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data**\n\nNow, let's analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone and compare it with the given options.\n\n*   **Methyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl group and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they should appear as a singlet (s) integrating to 3H. The typical chemical shift for such protons is around 2.0-2.7 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (-C6H4-):** There are four protons on the di-substituted ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n    *   A **para** substitution (1,4-disubstitution) would result in a symmetrical molecule. This typically gives two distinct signals, each a doublet (d), and each integrating to 2H.\n    *   Ortho or meta substitution would result in more complex, asymmetric patterns.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    This option lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm). The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not characteristic of aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, in the aromatic region is a classic indicator of a para-substituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for an aromatic ring substituted with an electron-withdrawing acetyl group and a halogen. For example, the reported spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows doublets at 7.91 and 7.45 ppm, and 4-bromoacetophenone shows signals at 7.83-7.84 and 7.61-7.63 ppm.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet integrating to 3H, which perfectly matches the methyl protons of an acetyl group. The chemical shift is also in the expected range.\n    *   This option is an excellent match for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    The signals and integrations (especially 1.3 ppm for 2H as a singlet) do not correspond to the proposed structure. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would correspond to a (p-halophenyl)acetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO), which also fits the initial description (8 carbons, carbonyl, etc.). However, the question asks for the correct data for the *prepared* compound. While structurally plausible, the data in option B for a haloacetophenone is a more common and direct interpretation. The data in option B perfectly aligns with the well-documented spectra of compounds like 4-chloroacetophenone.\n\nGiven the clear fit and commonality of the structure, option B is the most appropriate answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
