    "To solve this problem, we need the formula that relates the total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary to its orbital period and the radial velocity amplitudes of its component stars.\n\nFor a binary system where both stars' radial velocities can be measured (a double-lined spectroscopic binary), the individual masses (M₁ and M₂) are related to the period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K₁ and K₂) by the following equations, derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\nM₁ sin³(i) = (P / 2πG) * (K₁ + K₂)² * K₂\nM₂ sin³(i) = (P / 2πG) * (K₁ + K₂)² * K₁\n\nHere, 'i' is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight, and 'G' is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe total mass of the system (M_total = M₁ + M₂) is therefore:\n(M₁ + M₂) sin³(i) = (P / 2πG) * (K₁ + K₂)² * (K₁ + K₂)\nM_total * sin³(i) = (P / 2πG) * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. For an eclipsing binary system, the inclination 'i' is very close to 90 degrees, which means sin(i) is approximately 1. Therefore, we can simplify the formula to:\n\nM_total ≈ (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2πG)\n\nWe can now calculate the ratio of the mass of system 1 (M_total_1) to the mass of system 2 (M_total_2).\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total_1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total_2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio of the masses:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P₁ * (K_total_1)³) / (2πG) ] / [ (P₂ * (K_total_2)³) / (2πG) ]\n\nThe constant term (2πG) cancels out, leaving:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P₁ * (K_total_1)³) / (P₂ * (K_total_2)³)\n\nPlugging in the values (we can use years for the period and km/s for velocity as the units will cancel out in the ratio):\n\nRatio = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)\nRatio = (2 * 3375) / (15625)\nRatio = 6750 / 15625\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
