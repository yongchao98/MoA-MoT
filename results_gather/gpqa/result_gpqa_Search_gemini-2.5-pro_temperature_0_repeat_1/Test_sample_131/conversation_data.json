    "To solve this problem, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the potential compounds and then determine which 1:1 mixture from the options matches the experimental data.\n\n### Analysis of Individual Compounds\n\nAll four compounds share the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, the two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent, and all four methyl groups are equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** One singlet (2H). A spectral database shows this signal around 6.89 ppm.\n    *   **Aliphatic signal:** One singlet (12H). A spectral database shows this signal around 2.18 ppm.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. The two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** One singlet (2H). A spectral database shows this signal around 6.88 ppm.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** Two singlets (6H each, for a 1:1 ratio). A spectral database shows these at approximately 2.17 ppm and 2.24 ppm.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry. It has two distinct aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) and three distinct sets of methyl groups (C1/C3 are equivalent, C2 is unique, C5 is unique).\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, for a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. The four aromatic protons are equivalent. The two ethyl groups are equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** One quartet (4H, -CH2-) and one triplet (6H, -CH3-). This does not match the \"singlets\" described in the aliphatic region.\n\n### Analysis of the Mixture\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n**A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n*   This mixture would produce at least three aromatic signals and would have a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region, which is inconsistent with the data.\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H (or **1:1**) integration ratio. This matches the experimental data.\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two 6H singlets. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the experimental data.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   This mixture would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   This mixture would also produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This is inconsistent with the data.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only pair that matches the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
