    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. When seen with a broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   Another strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbon atoms of an alkene.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a common fragment. This value corresponds to the mass of a carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺). It can also correspond to an ethoxy fragment ([CH₂CH₃O]⁺), but the FTIR data strongly supports the carboxylic acid.\n\n### Evaluating the Molecular Formulas using Degrees of Unsaturation\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule containing at least two key features: a carboxylic acid (which includes one C=O double bond) and an alkene (a C=C double bond). Each double bond or ring in a molecule corresponds to one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nThe formula for calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each option:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    *   This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which could account for a C=O and a C=C bond. However, it only has one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    *   This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accommodates one C=O bond and one C=C bond. It also contains two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid. This formula fits all the spectral evidence.\n\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    *   This formula has only one degree of unsaturation, meaning it can have either one double bond (C=O or C=C) or one ring, but not both a C=O and a C=C bond. This contradicts the spectral data.\n\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    *   Similar to C₆H₁₂O₂, this formula has only one degree of unsaturation and is therefore inconsistent with the evidence for both an alkene and a carbonyl group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe spectroscopic data collectively indicates the presence of both a carboxylic acid and an alkene functional group. The only molecular formula that contains the necessary two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and has the required two degrees of unsaturation to account for both a C=O and a C=C double bond is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>"
