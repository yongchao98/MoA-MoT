    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Transit Geometry and Impact Parameter**\n    The impact parameter, *b*, is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at the point of closest approach, normalized by the star's radius (*R*<sub>s</sub>). It is given by the formula:\n    *b* = (*a* \\* cos(*i*)) / *R*<sub>s</sub>\n    where *a* is the semi-major axis of the orbit and *i* is the orbital inclination.\n\n2.  **Use the Information from the First Planet**\n    We are given that for the first planet, the impact parameter *b*<sub>1</sub> is 0.2.\n    *b*<sub>1</sub> = (*a*<sub>1</sub> \\* cos(*i*<sub>1</sub>)) / *R*<sub>s</sub> = 0.2\n    Since both planets share the same orbital plane, their inclination *i* is the same. This allows us to establish a relationship for the system's geometry:\n    *a*<sub>1</sub> \\* cos(*i*) = 0.2 \\* *R*<sub>s</sub>\n    This can be rearranged to find an expression for cos(*i*):\n    cos(*i*) = (0.2 \\* *R*<sub>s</sub>) / *a*<sub>1</sub>\n\n3.  **Establish the Condition for the Second Planet's Transit**\n    For the second planet to exhibit a transit, its center must pass in front of the star's disk. This means its impact parameter, *b*<sub>2</sub>, must be less than or equal to 1.\n    *b*<sub>2</sub> = (*a*<sub>2</sub> \\* cos(*i*)) / *R*<sub>s</sub> ≤ 1\n    This inequality defines the condition for the maximum possible semi-major axis (*a*<sub>2</sub>) for which a transit can occur.\n    *a*<sub>2</sub> \\* cos(*i*) ≤ *R*<sub>s</sub>\n\n    *(Note: A transit can technically occur as long as any part of the planet crosses the star, meaning b ≤ 1 + R<sub>p</sub>/R<sub>s</sub>. However, in the context of multiple-choice problems, it is common to use the simplification b ≤ 1, where the planet's center must cross the stellar disk. As we will see, this simplification leads directly to one of the answers.)*\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations**\n    Now, substitute the expression for cos(*i*) from step 2 into the inequality from step 3:\n    *a*<sub>2</sub> \\* [ (0.2 \\* *R*<sub>s</sub>) / *a*<sub>1</sub> ] ≤ *R*<sub>s</sub>\n    The stellar radius *R*<sub>s</sub> cancels out:\n    0.2 \\* (*a*<sub>2</sub> / *a*<sub>1</sub>) ≤ 1\n    Solving for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    *a*<sub>2</sub> / *a*<sub>1</sub> ≤ 1 / 0.2\n    *a*<sub>2</sub> / *a*<sub>1</sub> ≤ 5\n\n5.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (*P*) of a planet to its semi-major axis (*a*). For two planets orbiting the same star, the relationship is:\n    (*P*<sub>2</sub> / *P*<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = (*a*<sub>2</sub> / *a*<sub>1</sub>)<sup>3</sup>\n    We can express the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of the orbital periods:\n    *a*<sub>2</sub> / *a*<sub>1</sub> = (*P*<sub>2</sub> / *P*<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2/3</sup>\n\n6.  **Solve for the Maximum Period of the Second Planet**\n    Substitute the expression from Kepler's Third Law (step 5) into the inequality from step 4:\n    (*P*<sub>2</sub> / *P*<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2/3</sup> ≤ 5\n    Now, solve for *P*<sub>2</sub>:\n    *P*<sub>2</sub> / *P*<sub>1</sub> ≤ 5<sup>3/2</sup>\n    *P*<sub>2</sub> ≤ *P*<sub>1</sub> \\* 5<sup>3/2</sup>\n    We know *P*<sub>1</sub> = 3 days. Let's calculate 5<sup>3/2</sup>:\n    5<sup>3/2</sup> = 5 \\* √5 ≈ 5 \\* 2.236 ≈ 11.18\n    Finally, calculate the maximum period for the second planet:\n    *P*<sub>2</sub> ≤ 3 days \\* 11.18\n    *P*<sub>2</sub> ≤ 33.54 days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days. This corresponds to option D. The radii of the planets were not needed for this calculation, assuming the standard transit condition *b* ≤ 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
