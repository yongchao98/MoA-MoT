    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we must calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. The system consists of a central charge and 12 charges on the surface of a sphere. The total energy is the sum of two components: the interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere, and the interaction energy among the 12 charges on the sphere themselves.\n\n1.  **Energy of Interaction between Central Charge and Sphere Charges:**\n    Each of the 12 particles on the sphere is at a fixed distance, R = 2 m, from the central particle. The potential energy between the central charge (q) and one charge on the sphere (also q) is given by Coulomb's law. Since there are 12 such particles, this component of the energy (U_cs) is:\n    `U_cs = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n    where:\n    *   `k` is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C².\n    *   `q` is the charge of each particle, which is `2e`.\n    *   `e` is the elementary charge, 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.\n    *   `R` is the radius of the sphere, 2 m.\n\n2.  **Energy of Interaction among Sphere Charges:**\n    To achieve the minimum energy for the entire system, the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual potential energy. This is a well-known problem in physics called the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the particles are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\n    The potential energy of this icosahedral arrangement (U_ss) can be expressed as:\n    `U_ss = E_12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n    The coefficient `E_12` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of all inverse distances between the pairs of charges in the icosahedral arrangement, scaled by the radius. For N=12, the value of this coefficient is well-established to be approximately `E_12 ≈ 49.16533`.\n\n3.  **Total Minimum Energy:**\n    The total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two energy components.\n    `U_total = U_cs + U_ss = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + (E_12 * k * q^2 / R)`\n    `U_total = (12 + E_12) * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\nNow, we can substitute the values to find the numerical answer:\n*   `q = 2 * (1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) = 3.204353268 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   `q² ≈ 1.02678798 × 10⁻³⁷ C²`\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n*   `E_12 ≈ 49.16533`\n\n`U_total = (12 + 49.16533) * ( (8.98755 × 10⁹ * 1.02678798 × 10⁻³⁷) / 2 )`\n`U_total = 61.16533 * ( (9.22843 × 10⁻²⁸) / 2 )`\n`U_total = 61.16533 * (4.614215 × 10⁻²⁸ J)`\n`U_total ≈ 2.82203 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nRounding to three decimals as presented in the options, the minimum energy is 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J.\n\n<<<B>>>"
