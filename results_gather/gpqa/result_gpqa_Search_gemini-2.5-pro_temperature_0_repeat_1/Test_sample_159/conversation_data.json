    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture:** The problem describes an N-sided polygonal aperture where all apothems have the same length, 'a'. As the number of sides, N, approaches infinity, a regular polygon with a constant apothem becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Diffraction Pattern:** When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it creates a characteristic diffraction pattern in the far field known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central spot, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima:** The dark rings correspond to the minima of the intensity distribution. The angular positions of these minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for a minimum is given by:\n    `sin(θ) ≈ θ = (m * λ) / d`\n    where:\n    *   `θ` is the angular position of the minimum.\n    *   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n    *   `d` is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n    *   `m` is a coefficient corresponding to the order of the minimum.\n\n4.  **Relate Aperture Dimensions to the Formula:**\n    *   The radius of the circular aperture is `r = a`.\n    *   The diameter of the aperture is `d = 2r = 2a`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Position of the First Two Minima:** The positions of the minima are found at specific values.\n    *   **First Minimum (θ₁):** The first minimum occurs at an angle given by the well-known formula `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * λ / d`.\n        Substituting `d = 2a`, we get:\n        `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a`\n    *   **Second Minimum (θ₂):** The second minimum occurs at an angle given by `θ₂ ≈ 2.23 * λ / d`.\n        Substituting `d = 2a`, we get:\n        `θ₂ ≈ 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a`\n\n    More precise values for the minima locations are derived from the zeros of the Bessel function, which occur at ρ = 3.8317 and ρ = 7.0156 for the first and second minima, respectively. These lead to the same results.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:** The angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between their angular positions:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n    `Δθ ≈ (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.505 * λ / a`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** This calculated value is closest to option B. Using the more precise, unrounded coefficients from the Bessel function zeros (1.1166 and 0.6098) gives a result of 0.5068 λ / a, which confirms that B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
