    "### Analysis of Transit Probability\n\nTo determine which planet has a higher probability of being observed transiting its host star, we must compare their geometric transit probabilities. For a planet in a circular orbit, this probability is approximated by the ratio of the host star's radius (R*) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).\n\n**Key Information:**\n*   **Planet 1:**\n    *   Orbital Period: P₁\n    *   Host Star Mass: M₁ = 2 * M₂\n    *   Host Star Radius: R₁\n*   **Planet 2:**\n    *   Orbital Period: P₂ = 3 * P₁\n    *   Host Star Mass: M₂\n    *   Host Star Radius: R₂ = R₁\n\nThe transit probability (Prob) can be expressed as:\n`Prob ≈ R* / a`\n\nTo find the semi-major axis (a) for each planet, we use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. The law, in its general form, states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a³), and inversely proportional to the mass of the host star (M*). This can be written as:\n\n`P² ∝ a³ / M*`\n\nBy rearranging this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, we get:\n\n`a ∝ (P² * M*)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we can establish the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet 1 and Planet 2:\n\n`Prob₁ / Prob₂ = (R₁ / a₁) / (R₂ / a₂)`\n\nSince the host stars have the same radii (R₁ = R₂), the equation simplifies to:\n\n`Prob₁ / Prob₂ = a₂ / a₁`\n\nNext, we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes using the relationship derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\n`a₂ / a₁ = [(P₂² * M₂)^(1/3)] / [(P₁² * M₁)^(1/3)]`\n\nWe can substitute the known relationships between the two systems (P₂ = 3 * P₁ and M₁ = 2 * M₂):\n\n`a₂ / a₁ = [((3 * P₁)² * M₂)^(1/3)] / [(P₁² * (2 * M₂))^(1/3)]`\n`a₂ / a₁ = [(9 * P₁² * M₂)/(2 * P₁² * M₂)]^(1/3)`\n`a₂ / a₁ = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`a₂ / a₁ = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5 gives:\n\n`a₂ / a₁ ≈ 1.65`\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:\n\n`Prob₁ / Prob₂ ≈ 1.65`\n\nThis result indicates that Planet 1 has a transit probability that is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet 2. Consequently, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
