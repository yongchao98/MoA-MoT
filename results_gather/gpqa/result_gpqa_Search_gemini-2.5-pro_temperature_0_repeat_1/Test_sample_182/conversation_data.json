    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first identify the reactant and the product of the specified reaction.\n\n### 1. Reactant and its Structure\n\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is the principal functional group, located at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group is at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group is at position 5.\n\nBased on this structure, the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nTo verify, we can calculate its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as degrees of unsaturation. The IHD is calculated using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbon atoms and H is the number of hydrogen atoms (oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n\nIHD of reactant = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl (C=O) in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl (C=O) in the carboxylic acid group.\nThe calculated IHD matches the drawn structure, confirming the molecular formula is correct.\n\n### 2. Reaction and Product\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\nApplying these reductions to our reactant:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid at C1 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at C2 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at C5 becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe resulting product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\n### 3. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product\n\nNow, we determine the molecular formula of the product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n*   **Carbons**: 6 in the ring + 1 (methyl at C1) + 1 (methyl at C2) + 2 (ethyl at C5) = 10 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogens**: A saturated cycloalkane has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. For C₁₀, this would be C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nFinally, we calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the product:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD = 11 - 10 = 1\n\nThe IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure in the cyclohexane molecule, as all double bonds have been saturated.\n\n<<<A>>>"
