    "Of the options provided, the one physical theory that is believed to never require regularization at high energies is Superstring Theory.\n\n*   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory encounters problems with infinities, such as the self-energy of a point-like electron, which necessitates a form of regularization.\n*   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** As a quantum field theory, QED calculations involving interactions result in ultraviolet divergences that must be handled by regularization and renormalization.\n*   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** Similar to QED, QCD is a quantum field theory where high-energy interactions lead to infinities that require regularization techniques to be resolved.\n*   **D) Superstring Theory:** A key feature of superstring theory is that it is believed to be free of ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences. This is because the fundamental objects are one-dimensional strings rather than point particles, which smooths out the interactions at very small distances. Consequently, it does not require the regularization procedures that are essential in quantum field theories like QED and QCD.\n\n<<<D>>>"
