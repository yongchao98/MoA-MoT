    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Masses and Q-value\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-mass energies of the initial nucleus and the two fragments.\n\n*   **Initial rest-mass energy (Mc²):** 300 GeV\n*   **Sum of fragment rest-mass energies (m₁c² + m₂c²):** This is 99% of the initial energy.\n    m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV\n*   **Mass relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other.\n    m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²\n\nNow, we can solve for the individual rest-mass energies of the fragments:\nSubstitute the mass relationship into the sum:\n2 * m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n3 * m₂c² = 297 GeV\n**m₂c² = 99 GeV** (less massive fragment)\n\nThen, solve for the more massive fragment:\n**m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energy.\nQ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\n### 2. Calculate the Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T₁)\n\nIn any decay process, both total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the two fragments must be emitted with equal and opposite momenta.\n\nUsing the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in relativistic mechanics, the total energy of the more massive fragment (E₁) can be calculated with the following formula:\n\nE₁ = [ (Mc²)² + (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)² ] / [ 2 * Mc² ]\n\nPlugging in the values:\nE₁ = [ (300)² + (198)² - (99)² ] / [ 2 * 300 ]\nE₁ = [ 90000 + 39204 - 9801 ] / 600\nE₁ = 119403 / 600\n**E₁ = 199.005 GeV**\n\nThe kinetic energy (T₁) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\nT₁ = E₁ - m₁c²\nT₁ = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n**T₁ = 1005 MeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy (T₁_classical)\n\nIn classical (non-relativistic) mechanics, kinetic energy is distributed inversely proportional to the mass of the fragments to conserve momentum (p = mv, T = ½mv²).\n\n*   p₁ = p₂ => m₁v₁ = m₂v₂\n*   T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (½m₁v₁²) / (½m₂v₂²) = (m₁/m₂) * (v₁/v₂)²\n*   From the momentum relation, v₁/v₂ = m₂/m₁, so (v₁/v₂)² = (m₂/m₁)²\n*   T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (m₁/m₂) * (m₂/m₁)² = m₂/m₁\n\nSo, T₁_classical = (m₂/m₁) * T₂_classical.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the Q-value:\nQ = T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₂_classical = (m₁/m₂) * T₁_classical = 2 * T₁_classical\n\nSubstitute this into the total energy equation:\nT₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical = 1 GeV\n**T₁_classical = 1000 MeV**\n\n### 4. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, calculate the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n\nDifference = T₁ - T₁_classical\nDifference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**\n\n<<<B>>>"
