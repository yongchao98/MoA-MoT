    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number and can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nFirst, we identify the energy levels:\n*   **Ground state (n=0):** $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **First excited state (n=1):** $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state (n=2):** $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state (n=3):** $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $(\\frac{9}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the degeneracy of this energy level, which is the number of different combinations of the quantum numbers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$) that sum to $n=3$. The formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the $n$-th energy level is $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\nThe possible combinations of ($n_x, n_y, n_z$) that sum to 3 are:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) - (3 states)\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) - (6 states)\n*   The combination (1, 1, 1) - (1 state)\n\nThe total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10, which confirms the result from the formula.\n\nBased on these calculations, the energy of the third excited state is $(\\frac{9}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$ and its degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<A>>>"
