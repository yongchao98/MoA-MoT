    "When a particle with a magnetic moment is in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes the magnetic moment to precess around the magnetic field vector. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin of the particle is in an eigenstate of the `Sz` operator, specifically the \"spin up\" state.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the magnetic moment begins to precess around the new field direction. The Hamiltonian for the system is given by H = -**μ** ⋅ **B**, where **B** is the magnetic field vector. Since the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin angular momentum **S** (**μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio), the Hamiltonian is H = -γ**S** ⋅ **B**.\n\nWith the magnetic field **B** in the +Y direction (B = B**ŷ**), the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γB*Sy.\n\nThe spin vector, which is initially pointing along the Z-axis, will start to precess around the Y-axis. The angular frequency of this Larmor precession is given by ω = γB.\n\nThe z-component of the magnetic moment is given by μz = γSz. We are interested in the oscillation of the expectation value of this component, `<μz> = γ<Sz>`.\n\nAs the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The initial state is entirely in the +Z direction. As it rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis, the Z-component will vary sinusoidally. The frequency of this oscillation is the same as the frequency of the precession itself.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation values of the spin components can be found using the Heisenberg equation of motion. This leads to a set of coupled differential equations:\nd<Sz>/dt = γB<Sx>\nd<Sx>/dt = -γB<Sz>\n\nDifferentiating the first equation and substituting the second gives:\nd²<Sz>/dt² = -(γB)²<Sz>\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator with an angular frequency ω = γB. Therefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with a frequency of γB.\n\n<<<A>>>"
