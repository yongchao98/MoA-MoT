    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be significantly larger than the inherent energy uncertainty, or \"broadening,\" of each level. This energy uncertainty is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\nThe relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state (Δt) and its energy uncertainty (ΔE) is given by the formula:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s. This principle means that a state with a shorter lifetime will have a larger uncertainty in its energy.\n\nFirst, we calculate the minimum energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n*   **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\nTo resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be much greater than the larger of the two energy uncertainties, which is ΔE₁ (≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\nNow, let's compare this requirement with the given options:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is smaller than the energy uncertainty of both states.\n*   **B) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is significantly smaller than the energy uncertainties.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the energy uncertainty of the first state (10⁻⁸ eV < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n*   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is substantially larger than the energy uncertainty of both states (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\nTherefore, an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is required to ensure that the two energy levels are clearly distinguishable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
