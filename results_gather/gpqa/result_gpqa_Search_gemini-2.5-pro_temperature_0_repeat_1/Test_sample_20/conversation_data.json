    "### Analysis of the Compounds\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can readily interconvert. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which typically requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) that can migrate.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** In the structure of p-benzoquinone, the carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds. These carbons do not have any alpha-hydrogens on a saturated carbon atom that can participate in tautomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has methylene groups (-CH2-) located between the carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens and can participate in tautomerism. The enol form of this compound, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound, which makes it particularly stable. Consequently, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common feature leading to chirality is a stereocenter, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula for this compound is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Because this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and therefore do not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
