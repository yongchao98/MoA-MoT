    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under a specific set of assumptions about the semiconductor device and the nature of charge transport. A detailed analysis of these conditions reveals the correct statement among the given options.\n\nThe key assumptions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney law are:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device**: The model assumes that the current is transported by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes.\n*   **Trap-Free Semiconductor**: The material is considered to be an ideal insulator or intrinsic semiconductor with no charge trapping states within the bandgap.\n*   **Ohmic Contacts**: The electrical contacts to the semiconductor must be Ohmic. This means they act as perfect reservoirs of charge, allowing for charge injection without any energy barrier. A Schottky contact, which is rectifying, violates this assumption.\n*   **Negligible Diffusion Current**: The total current is assumed to be dominated by the drift of charge carriers under the applied electric field. The current component arising from the diffusion of carriers due to concentration gradients is considered negligible.\n\nAnalyzing the given options based on these principles:\n*   **A)** is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation describes a current that is fundamentally a **drift current**. Therefore, stating that the drift current is negligible contradicts the model itself.\n*   **B)** correctly states that the equation applies to a **trap-free, single-carrier device**. It also specifies \"no carrier injection barrier,\" which is the characteristic of an ideal Ohmic contact, and correctly identifies that the **diffusion current must be negligible**.\n*   **C)** is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law is derived for **single-carrier** transport, not for a two-carrier device where both electrons and holes contribute to the current.\n*   **D)** is incorrect because the model requires **Ohmic contacts**. A Schottky contact would create a rectifying barrier to charge injection, which is not accounted for in the basic Mott-Gurney model.\n\nTherefore, the statement that accurately describes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
