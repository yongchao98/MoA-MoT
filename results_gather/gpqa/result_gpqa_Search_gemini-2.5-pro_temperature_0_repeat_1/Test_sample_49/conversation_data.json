    "In quantum field theory, the calculation of Feynman diagrams involves integrating over all possible momenta for the particles in closed loops. When using the standard technique of dimensional regularization in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a diagram contributes a characteristic factor of `1/(4π)²` to the final mathematical expression for the diagram's value.\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nTo determine the number of loops, we must inspect the term that depends on the loop structure. The other terms relate to coupling constants (`alpha^3`, `g^2`), numerical and symmetry factors (`sqrt(2) * 8`), and kinematic dependencies (`(Q/M)^2`), but the power of `1/(4π)` is directly related to the number of loops.\n\nLet `L` be the number of loops in the diagram. The total loop factor in the expression will be:\n`(1/(4π)²)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`\n\nIn the given expression, the corresponding factor is `1/(4π)^6`.\n\nBy equating the exponents, we can solve for `L`:\n`2L = 6`\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
