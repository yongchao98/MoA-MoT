    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    This simplifies to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**:\n    *   According to Wien's Displacement Law, the peak emission wavelength (λ_emit) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature: λ_emit = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths (λ_obs) are the same for both stars (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂).\n    *   The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity due to the Doppler effect. The formula for the relativistic Doppler shift is:\n        λ_obs = λ_emit * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]\n        where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n\n5.  **Applying the Doppler Shift**:\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s. Therefore, its observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted peak wavelength: λ_obs₁ = λ_emit₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted (assuming it's moving away, which is the standard convention for positive velocity). So, its observed peak wavelength is related to its emitted wavelength by:\n        λ_obs₂ = λ_emit₂ * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)]\n    *   Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have:\n        λ_emit₁ = λ_emit₂ * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)]\n\n6.  **Connecting Wavelength and Temperature**:\n    *   Now, we substitute Wien's Law (λ_emit = b/T) into the equation:\n        b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)]\n    *   Simplifying this gives the ratio of the temperatures:\n        T₂/T₁ = √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)]\n    *   Therefore, the ratio we need for the luminosity calculation is:\n        T₁/T₂ = √[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * {√[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]}⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]²\n    *   Now, plug in the values for v₂ (700 km/s) and c (~300,000 km/s):\n        v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * [(1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333)]²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * [0.997667 / 1.002333]²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * (0.995344)²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.990709\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2291\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
