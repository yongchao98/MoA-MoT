    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Substance A2:**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The general formula for A2 is YF_n.\n\n    The mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\n    Using the approximate atomic mass of fluorine M(F) ≈ 19 g/mol:\n    0.3196 = (19n) / (M(Y) + 19n)\n    Solving for M(Y), we get:\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\n    We can test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible atomic mass for element Y:\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium)\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine/Selenium)\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, with M ≈ 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium)\n\n    Let's verify the fluorine percentage for Antimony(III) fluoride, SbF₃:\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 × 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n    ɷF = (3 × 18.998) / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188, or 31.89%.\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, making it highly probable that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substances A1 and A3:**\n    *   Substance A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂). This means A1 must have a higher oxidation state than Sb(III). The next stable fluoride is Antimony(V) fluoride, SbF₅. The reaction is SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂. Thus, **A1 is SbF₅**. The description of A1 as a \"bright-red\" substance that decomposes at room temperature (293 K) is unusual, as pure SbF₅ is a colorless liquid stable at that temperature, but we proceed with this identification based on the chemical reaction.\n    *   Substance A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) and it oxidizes xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony yields SbF₃ or SbF₅, and SbF₅ is a powerful oxidizing agent known to react with xenon. Therefore, **A3 is also SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5:**\n    *   The problem describes the formation of A5 by adding element Y (Sb) to a solution of A4. The reaction is: Sb + A4 → A5.\n    *   This is a classic comproportionation reaction, where an element in its zero oxidation state reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state to form a product with an intermediate oxidation state.\n    *   For this to occur, A4 must be the higher oxidation state compound, SbF₅, and the product A5 must be the lower oxidation state compound, SbF₃. The balanced reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃.\n    *   So, we identify **A4 as SbF₅** and **A5 as SbF₃**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Range:**\n    *   The question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of substance **A4** falls.\n    *   Based on our deduction, A4 is Antimony Pentafluoride (SbF₅).\n    *   Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n        M(SbF₅) = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F) = 121.76 + 5 × 18.998 = **216.75 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Options:**\n    The given ranges are:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n\n    Our calculated molecular weight for A4 (216.75 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges. This indicates a likely flaw in the problem statement or the options. Let's re-evaluate:\n\n    *   The identification of Y=Sb and the compounds SbF₃ and SbF₅ is chemically very sound and consistent with most of the clues.\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 (SbF₅) is 216.75 g/mol.\n    *   The molecular weight of A2 and A5 (both SbF₃) is 178.76 g/mol. This value falls perfectly within range **D) 160-180**.\n\n    Given that one of the options must be correct, the most probable error in the question is asking for the molecular weight of A4 when it intended to ask for A2 or A5. Alternatively, the problem assumes a non-standard reaction where A4 is SbF₃. In either of these likely error scenarios, the compound whose molecular weight lies within the options is SbF₃.\n\n    Assuming the question intended to point to the molecular weight of SbF₃:\n    MW(SbF₃) = 178.76 g/mol.\n    This value is in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>"
