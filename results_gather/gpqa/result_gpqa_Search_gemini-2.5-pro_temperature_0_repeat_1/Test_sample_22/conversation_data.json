    "The reaction in question is the addition of hydrogen bromide (HBr) to ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. The key reactive site in the starting material is the carbon-carbon double bond (an alkene). The reaction of an alkene with HBr is a classic example of electrophilic addition.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   Alkene: The substrate is Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH₂. The double bond is between carbon 3 and carbon 4 of the butyl chain.\n    *   Reagent: Hydrogen bromide (HBr), a strong acid that acts as an electrophile (H⁺).\n\n2.  **Mechanism (Electrophilic Addition)**:\n    *   **Step 1: Protonation.** The electron-rich double bond attacks the electrophilic proton (H⁺) from HBr. The proton can add to either carbon of the double bond, leading to two possible carbocation intermediates.\n        *   **Path A (Markovnikov's Rule):** The proton adds to the carbon atom that already has more hydrogen atoms (the terminal CH₂ group). This forms a more stable secondary carbocation on the adjacent carbon.\n            *   Intermediate: Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH⁺-CH₃ (a secondary carbocation)\n        *   **Path B (Anti-Markovnikov):** The proton adds to the other carbon of the double bond (the CH group). This forms a less stable primary carbocation.\n            *   Intermediate: Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH₂-CH₂⁺ (a primary carbocation)\n\n    *   According to Markovnikov's rule, the reaction will preferentially form the more stable carbocation. Therefore, the secondary carbocation (Path A) is the major intermediate. However, in many such reactions, a mixture of products is obtained because both pathways can occur to some extent. The presence of two spots on the TLC plate strongly suggests the formation of two products.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack.** The bromide ion (Br⁻), which was formed when HBr was protonated, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the positively charged carbocation.\n        *   **From Path A:** The Br⁻ attacks the secondary carbocation to form ((3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutyl)oxy)benzene.\n        *   **From Path B:** The Br⁻ attacks the primary carbocation to form ((4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutyl)oxy)benzene.\n\n3.  **Products**:\n    *   The two products formed are the result of both Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov addition.\n    *   **Product 1 (Anti-Markovnikov):** ((4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutyl)oxy)benzene\n    *   **Product 2 (Markovnikov):** ((3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutyl)oxy)benzene\n\n4.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The two spots observed on the TLC plate correspond to these two isomeric products. Option B correctly identifies both the Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov addition products.\n    *   Other possibilities like ether cleavage or complex rearrangements involving cyclization are less likely under typical conditions for HBr addition to an alkene, especially since the straightforward addition mechanism perfectly explains the formation of two distinct products.\n\nTherefore, the structures of the two products are (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
