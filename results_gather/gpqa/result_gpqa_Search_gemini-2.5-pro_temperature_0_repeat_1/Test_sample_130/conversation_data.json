    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (137 ppm and 165 ppm).\n        *   A single ¹H peak at 7.0 ppm indicates two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond.\n        *   Two ¹³C peaks suggest a symmetrical molecule. The peak at 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and the peak at 137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon.\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. The dehydration of its parent acid, maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid), yields this symmetrical anhydride.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which typically yields two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the \"endo rule\" for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the **endo product is the major product**, and the **exo product is the minor product**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is consistent with the addition of maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄).\n\n3.  **Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products:**\n    *   The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   **Proton Environment:**\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (Hₐ):** Two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. Due to their environment, they will appear as a **2H singlet**. A reasonable chemical shift is ~3.5 ppm.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (Me-bridgehead):** Two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). These will appear as a **6H singlet** at a high-field chemical shift, ~1.0 ppm.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyl Protons (Me-vinyl):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C5 and C6). These will appear as a **6H singlet** at a downfield chemical shift compared to the other methyls, ~1.7 ppm.\n        *   **Bridge Methylene Protons (H-bridge):** Two non-equivalent protons on the C7 bridge (*syn* and *anti*). They will appear as two separate signals, likely **1H doublets** due to geminal coupling. A reasonable chemical shift is ~1.5 ppm.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships (NOESY):**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the rest of the bicyclic system. This brings the anhydride protons (Hₐ) into close proximity with the *anti*-proton of the C7 bridge.\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is oriented \"away\" from the bicyclic system. This moves the anhydride protons (Hₐ) far from the C7 bridge protons but brings them close to the vinylic methyl groups (Me-vinyl).\n\n4.  **Interpreting the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the spectrum of the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n    *   This corresponds to an interaction that exists only (or primarily) in the *endo* isomer.\n    *   Based on the analysis above, the key interaction specific to the *endo* (major) product is between the **anhydride protons (Hₐ)** and one of the **C7 bridge protons**.\n\n5.  **Matching with the Options:**\n    *   **Anhydride protons (Hₐ):** Identified as the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **C7 bridge proton:** Identified as the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\n    Let's evaluate the given options:\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hₐ). This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* (*exo*) product.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H-bridge). While these protons are somewhat close, this is not the most prominent or differentiating NOE signal between the two isomers.\n    *   **C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H-bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hₐ). This matches our analysis for the major (*endo*) product.**\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-vinyl). These groups are on opposite sides of the molecule and are too far apart for a NOESY cross-peak.\n\n<<<C>>>"
