    "### All Operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) Must Respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT Symmetries\n\nAll operators within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) are required to respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. In contrast, CP symmetry is not a mandatory symmetry and can be violated by operators in the SMEFT.\n\nThe SMEFT is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM), incorporating higher-dimensional operators to describe the effects of new physics at energy scales beyond the reach of current experiments. A fundamental principle in the construction of the SMEFT is that it must adhere to the established symmetries of the Standard Model, which include gauge and Poincaré symmetries. The Poincaré group of spacetime symmetries includes translations, rotations, and boosts, the latter two forming the Lorentz group. Therefore, both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries are inherently respected by all SMEFT operators.\n\nThe CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory, stating that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be symmetric under the combined operations of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is formulated as a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must, by extension, conserve CPT symmetry.\n\nOn the other hand, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry in the SMEFT. In fact, the framework explicitly allows for CP-violating operators. The study of these operators is a significant area of research, as they could provide explanations for phenomena not accounted for by the Standard Model, such as the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The existence of numerous studies classifying and constraining these CP-violating operators underscores that CP conservation is not a prerequisite for all operators in the SMEFT.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
