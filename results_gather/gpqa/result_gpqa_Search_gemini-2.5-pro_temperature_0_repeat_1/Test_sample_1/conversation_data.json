    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n\n*   **Reactants**: *trans*-cinnamaldehyde and methylmagnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent).\n*   **Reaction**: The methyl group from the Grignard reagent attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde in a 1,2-addition reaction. Subsequent workup with acid protonates the oxygen to form a secondary alcohol.\n*   ***trans*-cinnamaldehyde structure**: C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO. It contains 9 carbon atoms (6 in the phenyl ring and 3 in the propenal chain).\n*   **Product 1 structure**: The addition of a methyl group (CH₃) results in (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol. Its structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃.\n*   **Carbon count for Product 1**: 9 (from cinnamaldehyde) + 1 (from methylmagnesium bromide) = 10 carbon atoms.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n\n*   **Reactants**: Product 1 ((E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol) and pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC).\n*   **Reaction**: PCC is an oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols into ketones.\n*   **Product 2 structure**: The secondary alcohol group in Product 1 is oxidized to a ketone, forming (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, commonly known as benzalacetone. Its structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n*   **Carbon count for Product 2**: The number of carbon atoms remains unchanged during this oxidation. Thus, Product 2 has 10 carbon atoms.\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n\n*   **Reactants**: Product 2 (benzalacetone) and (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane, also known as dimethyloxosulfonium methylide or the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n*   **Reaction**: This is a Corey-Chaykovsky reaction. When an α,β-unsaturated ketone reacts with dimethyloxosulfonium methylide, the ylide adds a methylene group (CH₂) across the carbon-carbon double bond (a 1,4-conjugate addition) to form a cyclopropane ring.\n*   **Product 3 structure**: The reaction adds a CH₂ group to the double bond of benzalacetone, forming 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Carbon count for Product 3**: Product 2 had 10 carbon atoms. The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent adds one carbon atom (from the CH₂ group). Therefore, the final product has 10 + 1 = 11 carbon atoms.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n*   Cinnamaldehyde: 9 carbons\n*   Product 1: 9 + 1 = 10 carbons\n*   Product 2: 10 carbons\n*   Product 3: 10 + 1 = 11 carbons\n\nThus, there are 11 carbon atoms in product 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
