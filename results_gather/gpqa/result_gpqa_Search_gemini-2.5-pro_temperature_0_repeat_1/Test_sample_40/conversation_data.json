    "To solve this problem, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's define our frames of reference:\n\n*   **S' Frame:** This is the rest frame of the glass.\n*   **S Frame:** This is the laboratory frame, where the observer is stationary.\n\nThe velocity of the glass (S' frame) as observed from the laboratory (S frame) is `v`.\n\nThe speed of light within the glass, as measured in its own rest frame (S'), is given by `u' = c/n`. Since the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`, the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\nThe light beam is propagating in the same direction as the moving glass. We want to find the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). Let's call this speed `u`.\n\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula for velocities in the same direction is:\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute the values we have (`u' = 1/n` and `c = 1`) into this equation:\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can first simplify the denominator:\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\nNext, to eliminate the fractions within the numerator and denominator, we multiply both by `n`:\n`u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n`u = ( n/n + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*v/n )`\n`u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\nThis result corresponds to the formula for the Fizeau effect, which describes the speed of light in a moving medium.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nC) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nD) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\nThe calculated speed matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
