    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of Single Mutants\nFirst, let's examine the effect of each individual gene knockout on anthracnose resistance compared to the 100% resistance of the wild-type (control) plant.\n*   **g1 mutant (75% resistance):** The loss of G1 function results in a 25% reduction in resistance. This indicates that G1 contributes to the plant's defense, but it is not essential.\n*   **g2 mutant (0% resistance):** The loss of G2 function leads to a complete loss of resistance. This demonstrates that G2 is an essential gene for the plant's defense against anthracnose.\n*   **g3 mutant (50% resistance):** The loss of G3 function causes a 50% reduction in resistance, indicating that G3 plays a significant role in the defense mechanism.\n\n### Analysis of Double Mutants and Gene Interactions\n\nNow, we analyze the double mutants to understand how the genes interact. This involves looking for phenomena like epistasis, where the effect of one gene masks the effect of another.\n\n*   **g1g2 and g2g3 mutants (0% resistance):** Both the `g1g2` and `g2g3` double mutants show 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant phenotype. When the phenotype of a double mutant is the same as that of one of the single mutants, the corresponding gene is said to be epistatic to the other. In this case, the complete susceptibility of the `g2` mutant masks the partial resistance phenotypes of `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%). This strong epistatic relationship suggests that G2 is a crucial component in the resistance pathway, acting either downstream of G1 and G3 or as a master upstream regulator. Given the prompt states one gene is a transcription factor—a protein that regulates other genes—G2 is the most likely candidate for this role.\n\n*   **g1g3 mutant (10% resistance):**\n    *   The `g1` single mutant has 75% resistance (25% loss).\n    *   The `g3` single mutant has 50% resistance (50% loss).\n    *   If the genes acted independently, we might expect an additive loss of resistance (25% + 50% = 75% loss), which would result in 25% resistance.\n    *   However, the observed resistance in the `g1g3` double mutant is only 10% (a 90% loss). This phenotype is much more severe than the phenotype of either single mutant and more severe than a simple additive effect. This type of genetic interaction is called synergism.\n    *   Synergism often points towards **gene redundancy**, where two genes perform similar or overlapping functions. While the loss of one gene can be partially compensated for by the other, the loss of both genes leads to a much more significant failure of the system. The data strongly supports that G1 and G3 act in a partially redundant manner.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the given conclusions based on this analysis:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** The conclusion that G2 is a transcription factor is plausible. However, the experiment only measures one trait (disease resistance), so there is no evidence for pleiotropy (a single gene affecting multiple traits). Also, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant's phenotype (10% resistance) is not the same as the g1 mutant's (75% resistance).\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** The conclusion that G2 is a transcription factor is plausible. However, we cannot determine if G1 and G3 share a promoter from this data. G3 is not epistatic to G1, as the double mutant's phenotype (10%) differs from the g3 mutant's (50%).\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor due to its epistatic relationship with G1 and G3. It also correctly interprets the synergistic interaction between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. The final clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is incorrect based on a standard definition of masking epistasis. However, this option provides the two most accurate conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment.\n\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect because G1 is not the primary candidate for the transcription factor. If G1 were a transcription factor for G2, the `g1` mutant should have a 0% resistance phenotype, which it does not.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption C provides the most accurate description of the genetic interactions. The data strongly supports that G2 is a key regulatory gene (likely the transcription factor) and that G1 and G3 function with partial redundancy. Despite the inaccuracy of the final clause regarding epistasis between G1 and G3, the other two points in this option are the best fit for the experimental data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
