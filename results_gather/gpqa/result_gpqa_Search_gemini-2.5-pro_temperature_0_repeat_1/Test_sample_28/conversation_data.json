    "To effectively eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, the goal is to disrupt the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. The most direct way to achieve this is by introducing a mutation that leads to a non-functional or truncated protein. An analysis of the provided gene sequences reveals the impact of each mutation.\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins with `ATG`, the start codon, which initiates protein synthesis. The subsequent codons dictate the amino acid sequence of the protein. The most effective mutation among the choices would be one that introduces a premature stop codon, thereby halting protein synthesis and producing a shortened, non-functional protein.\n\nLet's examine the codons in the intact and mutant sequences:\n\n*   **Intact gene:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   ATG (Start)\n    *   TTT (Phenylalanine)\n    *   CTC (Leucine)\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   The change from TTT to TTC is a silent mutation, as both codons code for Phenylalanine.\n    *   The change from CTC to TAC is a missense mutation, replacing Leucine with Tyrosine. This might alter the protein's function but not necessarily eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   The change from TTT to TTC is a silent mutation.\n    *   The change from CTC to **TAA** is a nonsense mutation. TAA is a stop codon. This mutation will cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, resulting in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n    *   This sequence contains multiple changes that result in missense mutations, altering several amino acids in the protein. While this could potentially reduce or alter the protein's function, it is less certain to eliminate it completely compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’\n    *   The change from CTC to TAC is a missense mutation, replacing Leucine with Tyrosine. Similar to Mutant 1, this may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\nThe chemical mutagen EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) typically induces point mutations, primarily G:C to A:T transitions. The mutation in Mutant 2, a change from C to A in the third codon (CTC to TAA), is a transversion. While transitions are more common with EMS, transversions can also occur. Given the options, the introduction of a premature stop codon in Mutant 2 is the most definitive way to knock out the gene's function.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable choice to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
