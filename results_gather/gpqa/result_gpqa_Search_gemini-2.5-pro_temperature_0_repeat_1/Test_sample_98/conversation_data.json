    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n**FTIR Spectroscopy**\n\nThe provided FTIR data shows two key absorption peaks:\n*   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. This is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. This peak is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\nAll four possible compounds are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the correct functional group is present but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\n\nThe ¹H NMR data provides the specific details needed to determine the carbon skeleton. The key is the complex splitting patterns observed for two different signals. Splitting arises when a proton's signal is influenced by neighboring, non-equivalent protons, following the n+1 rule. For complex structures where a proton is coupled to multiple, different sets of neighbors, the splitting pattern is a combination of the individual splittings (e.g., a doublet of triplets).\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This indicates a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet**.\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet**.\n    *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), causing a **quartet**.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This indicates a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet**.\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet**.\n    *   Another, different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second **triplet**.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Structures\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the protons on the main chain of each candidate molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    ```\n          CH₂CH₃\n          |\n    CH₃ - CH(b) - CH(c) - CH₂(d) - COOH\n               |\n               CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n    *   The proton **H(b)** is adjacent to the CH₃ group (3H, quartet), the H(c) proton (1H, doublet), and the CH₂ of an ethyl group (2H, triplet). This matches the **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** pattern.\n    *   The proton **H(c)** is adjacent to the H(b) proton (1H, doublet), the CH₂(d) group (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of the other ethyl group (2H, triplet). This matches the **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** pattern.\n    *   This structure is fully consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n    This structure contains protons that would result in a doublet of triplets of quartets, but it lacks any proton that is coupled to two different sets of two equivalent protons, and therefore cannot produce a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n    This structure has a proton that would be a doublet of triplets of quartets, but it does not have a proton that could produce a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n    This structure has a proton that could produce a doublet of triplets of triplets, but it lacks a proton coupled to a methyl group that would be necessary to create a quartet as part of a more complex signal like a dtq.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the ¹H NMR splitting patterns, only molecule A, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, contains protons that would give rise to both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n<<<A>>>"
