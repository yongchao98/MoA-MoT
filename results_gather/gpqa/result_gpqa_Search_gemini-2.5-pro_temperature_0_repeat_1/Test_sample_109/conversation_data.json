    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and compare it to the limiting magnitudes of the instruments.\n\nThe conditions are as follows:\n*   **ESPRESSO Limiting Magnitude:** Can observe stars brighter than 17 mag.\n*   **HIRES Limiting Magnitude:** Can observe stars brighter than 16 mag.\n*   **Condition for Detection by Both:** The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than 16 mag (the stricter of the two limits).\n\nThe prompt specifies to disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes, meaning we should not consider the star's declination (celestial latitude) or the observatories' geographical locations for this problem. The evaluation will be based solely on magnitude.\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) in parsecs (pc) using the distance modulus formula. When interstellar extinction (A_V) is present, it must also be added.\nThe formulas are:\n*   `m = M + 5 * log10(d / 10)`\n*   `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`\n*   `Observed Apparent Magnitude = m + A_V`\n\nHere is the analysis for each star:\n\n**Star1**\n*   Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15.5 mag\n*   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n*   Calculation: `m = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5`\n*   **Result:** The apparent magnitude is 15.5. This is brighter than 16 mag, so Star1 is observable by both instruments.\n\n**Star2**\n*   Apparent V magnitude (m) = 16.5 mag\n*   **Result:** The apparent magnitude is given as 16.5. This is fainter than 16 mag, so Star2 cannot be observed by HIRES.\n\n**Star3**\n*   Apparent V magnitude (m) = 15.5 mag\n*   The problem provides the apparent magnitude directly. The additional information about color excess and distance is extraneous.\n*   **Result:** The apparent magnitude is 15.5. This is brighter than 16 mag, so Star3 is observable by both instruments.\n\n**Star4**\n*   Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15.5 mag\n*   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n*   Color Excess E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n*   Calculation of extinction: `A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag`\n*   Calculation of observed magnitude: `m_obs = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74`\n*   **Result:** The apparent magnitude is 16.74. This is fainter than 16 mag, so Star4 cannot be observed by HIRES.\n\n**Star5**\n*   Absolute V magnitude (M) = 16.5 mag\n*   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n*   Calculation: `m = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995`\n*   **Result:** The apparent magnitude is approximately 15.0. This is brighter than 16 mag, so Star5 is observable by both instruments.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe stars that are bright enough to be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are Star1, Star3, and Star5. Reviewing the given options, the only pair that consists of stars observable by both is Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<D>>>"
