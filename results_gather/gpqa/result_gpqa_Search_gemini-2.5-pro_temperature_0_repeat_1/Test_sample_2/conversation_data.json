    "To find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Define the state and operators:**\n\nThe spin state of the particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nIn matrix notation, the spin-up state |↑⟩ is represented by the column vectorᵀ and the spin-down state |↓⟩ is represented byᵀ. Therefore, the state vector |ψ⟩ is:\n|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ\n\nThe Pauli matrices σz and σx are given by:\nσz = [, [0, -1]]\nσx = [,]\n\nThe operator in question is O = 10σz + 5σx.\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value:**\n\nThe expectation value of an operator O for a state |ψ⟩ is calculated using the formula ⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. We can calculate the expectation values for σz and σx separately and then combine them.\n\n**Expectation value of σz:**\nFirst, we find the action of σz on |ψ⟩:\nσz|ψ⟩ = [, [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ = [0.5, -√3/2]ᵀ\n\nThen, we calculate ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩:\n⟨σz⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2]ᵀ\n⟨σz⟩ = (0.5 * 0.5) + (√3/2 * -√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\n**Expectation value of σx:**\nFirst, we find the action of σx on |ψ⟩:\nσx|ψ⟩ = [,] * [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ = [√3/2, 0.5]ᵀ\n\nThen, we calculate ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩:\n⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]ᵀ\n⟨σx⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\n**3. Combine the results:**\n\nNow, we can find the expectation value of the full operator O:\n⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩\n⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)\n⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<A>>>"
