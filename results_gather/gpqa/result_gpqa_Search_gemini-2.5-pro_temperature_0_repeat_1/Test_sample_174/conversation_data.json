    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a simple shape like a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The radiation emitted by such a dipole has distinct characteristics regarding its power distribution and wavelength dependence.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is not uniform in all directions. It is dependent on the angle `θ` with respect to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis). The relationship is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nThe maximum power, `A`, is radiated in the direction where `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`, we can set up a ratio:\n\n(Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = `sin²(30°) / sin²(90°)`\n\nSince `sin(30°) = 1/2` and `sin(90°) = 1`, the calculation is:\n\nFraction = `(1/2)² / 1² = 1/4`\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at an angle of 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power `A`.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is also strongly dependent on the frequency of oscillation, and consequently, on the wavelength of the emitted radiation. The total power radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω` (`P ∝ ω⁴`).\n\nThe relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light. Substituting this into the power proportionality gives:\n\n`P ∝ (1/λ)⁴` or `P ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis means the radiated power per unit solid angle, the function `f(λ, θ)`, will also be proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. This inverse relationship indicates that shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies) are radiated much more powerfully, a phenomenon also seen in Rayleigh scattering which is why the sky appears blue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two findings:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
