    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a total volume of 100 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution at 25°C.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Molar Concentration of Fe³⁺\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\nThis amount is dissolved in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n*   [Fe³⁺] = (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\n### Step 2: Determine the pH of the Solution\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ is governed by its solubility product, Ksp.\n*   Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n\nFor the Fe(OH)₃ to be completely dissolved, the ion product must be equal to the Ksp. The Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 2.8 x 10⁻³⁹.\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n*   2.8 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.357 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³\n\nNow, we solve for the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (2.8 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.993 x 10⁻³⁷\n*   [OH⁻] = (2.993 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 6.688 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\nFrom the [OH⁻], we can calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n*   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.688 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.17\n*   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.17 = 1.83\n\nThis pH is the pH of the final solution. Looking at the options, pH 2.04 is the closest value. Let's re-evaluate using a different Ksp value, as it can vary between sources. Using Ksp = 1.6 x 10⁻³⁹:\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (1.6 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) ≈ 1.710 x 10⁻³⁷\n*   [OH⁻] = (1.710 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 5.55 x 10⁻¹³ M\n*   pOH = -log₁₀(5.55 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.26\n*   pH = 14 - 12.26 = 1.74\n\nLet's try the pH from option D, pH = 2.04, to see if it works out.\n*   If pH = 2.04, then pOH = 14 - 2.04 = 11.96\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.⁹⁶ ≈ 1.10 x 10⁻¹² M\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.357 x 10⁻³) * (1.10 x 10⁻¹²)³ ≈ 1.24 x 10⁻⁴⁷. This is far from published values.\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy. Let's reconsider the problem, accounting for the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺.\nFe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\nThe Ka for this reaction is about 6.3 x 10⁻³. The problem asks for the minimum acid to dissolve the precipitate, which is dictated by the Ksp equilibrium. The slight variations in Ksp values can lead to different pH results. Let's proceed with the pH of 2.04 from option D and calculate the required acid volume.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Volume of Acid Needed\n\nThe overall reaction with the strong acid (H⁺) is:\n*   Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ ions added must accomplish two things:\n1.  React with the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  Establish the final acidic pH of the solution.\n\n**1. Moles of H⁺ to react with Fe(OH)₃:**\n*   From the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * (moles of Fe(OH)₃) = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n**2. Moles of H⁺ remaining to create the final pH:**\n*   Final pH = 2.04\n*   [H⁺] (final) = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M ≈ 9.12 x 10⁻³ M\n*   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺] (final) * Total Volume = (9.12 x 10⁻³ M) * (0.1 L) = 9.12 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**Total moles of H⁺ required:**\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) + (9.12 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 3.719 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n**Volume of 0.1 M strong acid:**\n*   Volume = Total Moles H⁺ / Concentration of acid\n*   Volume = (3.719 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03719 L\n*   Volume in cm³ = 0.03719 L * 1000 cm³/L = 37.19 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume in option D (28.05 cm³). Let's re-examine the calculation.\n\nLet's assume the pH of 2.69 and volume of 30.09 cm³ from option C is correct and work backward.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ remaining:** [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 2.04 x 10⁻³ M. Moles = (2.04 x 10⁻³ M) * 0.1 L = 2.04 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ added:** Volume * Molarity = 0.03009 L * 0.1 M = 3.009 x 10⁻³ mol.\n*   **Moles H⁺ reacted:** Total Moles - Moles remaining = (3.009 x 10⁻³) - (2.04 x 10⁻⁴) = 2.805 x 10⁻³ mol.\nThis value (2.805 x 10⁻³ mol) is extremely close to the stoichiometric amount required to react with the Fe(OH)₃ we calculated earlier (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol). The minor difference is likely due to rounding during the steps.\n\nTherefore, the calculations for option C are consistent with the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n\nFinal check of the pH for option C:\n*   pH = 2.69\n*   pOH = 14 - 2.69 = 11.31\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.³¹ ≈ 4.9 x 10⁻¹² M\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.357 x 10⁻³) * (4.9 x 10⁻¹²)³ ≈ 1.1 x 10⁻⁴⁵. This Ksp is still inconsistent with published values.\n\nHowever, among the given choices, option C is the only one where the provided volume of acid corresponds almost perfectly to the amount needed to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given pH. The discrepancy in the Ksp value might stem from using simplified assumptions and not accounting for activity coefficients or the formation of various iron-hydroxy complexes in the solution. Given the multiple-choice format, the most chemically consistent answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
