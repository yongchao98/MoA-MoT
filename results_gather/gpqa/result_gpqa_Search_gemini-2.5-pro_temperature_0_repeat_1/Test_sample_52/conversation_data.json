    "The detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic information allows for the identification of the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two attached groups.\n2.  **FTIR - Ester group:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring, which would have two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the other vinyl proton and the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets, while the other vinyl proton is split into a doublet.\n    *   **Two –CH₃ signals:** The molecule contains two distinct methyl groups. One is part of the propenyl group, and the other is consistent with a methyl ester (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **No –CH₂ signals:** The absence of any methylene (-CH₂-) groups is a crucial constraint for the final structure.\n\n### Assembling the Structure:\n\nBased on the fragments identified from the spectroscopic data, the molecule consists of:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄)\n*   A methyl ester group (-COOCH₃)\n*   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)\n\nA plausible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. This structure is consistent with all the provided NMR data: a para-substituted ring, a propenyl group, two different methyl groups, and no methylene groups.\n\n### Determining the Chemical Formula:\n\nTo find the chemical formula, we sum the atoms from each part of the proposed structure:\n*   **Benzene ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl group:** C₃H₅\n*   **Methyl ester group:** C₂H₃O₂\n\n**Total Calculation:**\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This corresponds to a molecule with a degree of unsaturation of 6 (one ring, four double bonds), which matches the proposed structure (1 ring + 3 aromatic C=C + 1 vinyl C=C + 1 C=O).\n\n### Evaluating Other Options:\n\n*   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This formula would have a degree of unsaturation of 5. It would require removing a double bond, likely resulting in a propyl group instead of a propenyl group, which would introduce -CH₂- signals, contradicting the data.\n*   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 7. Constructing a molecule with this formula that fits all the NMR constraints (especially the absence of -CH₂- groups and the specific vinyl and methyl signals) is not feasible.\n*   **C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 6. A possible structure would be ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. However, the ethyl group contains a -CH₂- group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that perfectly matches the detailed spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
