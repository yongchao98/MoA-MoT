    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Principle of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a random, memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a specific time frame is constant and does not depend on how long the atom has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability. We only need to calculate the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes.\n\n### 2. Determine the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving (not decaying) for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\nP(survival) = e^(-λt)\n\nWhere:\n*   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.718).\n*   `λ` is the decay constant.\n*   `t` is the time.\n\nThe probability of decay is therefore:\nP(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find the probability of survival.\n\nP(survival in 100 min) = 1 - P(decay in 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nNow, we can set up the equation:\n0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Decay in 150 Minutes\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the same formula:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can solve for `e^(-λ)` from the first equation:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n(e^(-λ))^100 = 0.68\ne^(-λ) = (0.68)^(1/100)\n\nNow, substitute this into the equation for the 150-minute decay:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (e^(-λ))^150\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - ((0.68)^(1/100))^150\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^(150/100)\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nThe final step is to compute the value of 1 - (0.68)^1.5.\n\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.559\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - 0.559\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.441\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get approximately 44.1%.\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
