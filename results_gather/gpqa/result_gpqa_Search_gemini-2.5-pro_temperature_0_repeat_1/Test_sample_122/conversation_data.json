    "The search results confirm my understanding of the physics involved.\n\n*   **Frames of Reference:** The problem involves two inertial frames: the Galaxy's frame (let's call it S) and the ejecta's frame (let's call it S').\n*   **Proper Time:** The time measured in the moving frame (S', the ejecta) is the proper time, `Δτ` or `Δt₀`. In this problem, this is 50 seconds.\n*   **Time Dilation:** An observer in the stationary frame (S, the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval, `Δt`.\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** The relationship between the two times is given by `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   **Distance Calculation:** The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is calculated by multiplying the ejecta's velocity (relative to the Galaxy) by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   Velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Proper time (in ejecta's frame), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   Speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the ratio `v/c`:**\n    *   `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:**\n    *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`.\n    *   `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`.\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame:**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame:**\n    *   `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`.\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to option C. The classical (non-relativistic) calculation would be `d = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which is option D. Since the velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%), relativistic effects must be accounted for, making option D incorrect. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than in the ejecta's frame, so the distance traveled must be greater than the classical calculation. This eliminates options A, B, and D, leaving C as the only plausible answer.\n\nThe calculation confirms that C is the correct choice.\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\nThis rounds to 3,060,000 km for the purpose of the multiple-choice question.\n\nFinal check of the logic.\n- The question asks for distance in the Galaxy frame.\n- Distance = velocity (in Galaxy frame) * time (in Galaxy frame).\n- Velocity is given as 60,000 km/s.\n- The time given (50s) is in the ejecta's frame (the moving clock). This is the proper time `Δt₀`.\n- We need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`.\n- The formula for time dilation is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`. A moving clock runs slow, so the time elapsed on the stationary (Galaxy) clock `Δt` is longer. This is correct.\n- The calculation is `d = v * γ * Δt₀`.\n- The calculation yields a result very close to option C.\n\nThe logic and calculations are sound.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   The Galaxy is the stationary reference frame (S).\n    *   The supernova ejecta is the moving reference frame (S').\n\n2.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (the proper time) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (`d`).\n\n4.  **Apply the relevant formulas:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is given by `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy) is longer than the proper time measured in the moving frame (ejecta). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor, `γ`, is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light: `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`.\n        *   Now, calculate γ: `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`.\n        *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`.\n\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n        *   Using the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`.\n\n    *   **Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n        *   `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`.\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\n    Our calculated distance of approximately 3,061,800 km is closest to option C, 3,060,000 km. The non-relativistic calculation (`60,000 km/s * 50 s`) would yield 3,000,000 km (Option D), but this is incorrect because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\n<<<C>>>"
