  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "The inability to express the recombinant protein is due to the premature termination of translation. An analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals the underlying issue.\n\nThe sequence begins with `ATG`, the correct start codon for Methionine. This is followed by the sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The standard amino acid sequence for an HA tag is YPYDVPDYA (Tyrosine-Proline-Tyrosine-Aspartic Acid-Valine-Proline-Aspartic Acid-Tyrosine-Alanine). The corresponding DNA sequence provided is `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`, which correctly codes for the HA tag peptide.\n\nHowever, immediately following the HA tag sequence, the DNA reads `AAA TGA`.\n*   `AAA` codes for the amino acid Lysine.\n*   `TGA` is one of the three universal stop codons (along with TAA and TAG).\n\nWhen the ribosome encounters this `TGA` codon in the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript, it will recruit release factors, causing the ribosome to detach and end the protein synthesis process. This results in the production of a very short, non-functional peptide (the HA tag plus a single Lysine residue) instead of the full-length GADD45G protein. This early termination of translation is the direct cause of the observed lack of protein expression.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is correct. A premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the sequence caused translation to halt.\n*   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. The HA tag sequence itself is correct.\n*   **C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon in the sequence is TGA, not TAA. Second, stop codons are not recognized by tRNAs but by protein release factors.\n*   **D) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** This is incorrect. While linkers can be important, the primary issue here is that the full-length protein is not being synthesized in the first place due to the premature stop codon.\n\n<<<A>>>"
