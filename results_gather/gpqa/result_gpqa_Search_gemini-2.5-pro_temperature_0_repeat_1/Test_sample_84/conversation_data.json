    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2a₁))^(1/2) * (1 - A₁)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2a₂))^(1/2) * (1 - A₂)^(1/4)]\n\nSince the planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, most terms cancel out, and the equation simplifies to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a₁)^(1/2) / (1/a₂)^(1/2) = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity**\n\nThe amplitude of the radial velocity (K) of a star, induced by a planet in a circular orbit, is given by:\n\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\n\nWhere:\n*   M_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince the planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight, which means the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, and therefore sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\nK² = (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\na = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\n\nUsing the formula for `a`, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\n\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**4. Calculating the Ratios of Masses and Radial Velocities**\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   Mass ratio: M_p₂ / M_p₁ = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5/7\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude `K` is related to the Doppler shift (Δλ) by K = c * (Δλ / λ₀), where `c` is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength.\n\n*   K₁ is proportional to Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å.\n*   K₂ is proportional to Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å.\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is:\n*   K₁ / K₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2) = 15 / 28\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
