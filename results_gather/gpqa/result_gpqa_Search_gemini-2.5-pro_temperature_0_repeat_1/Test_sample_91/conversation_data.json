    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the atoms and bonds. The chemical formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's break down the structure and count the carbon and hydrogen atoms:\n*   **(CH3)2C=**: A carbon atom double-bonded to the next carbon, and also single-bonded to two methyl (CH3) groups. This part has 3 carbons and 6 hydrogens.\n*   **=CH-**: A carbon atom with one hydrogen, participating in the double bond and a single bond. This part has 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n*   **-CH2-**: A carbon atom with two hydrogens, connected by single bonds. This part has 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n*   **-CH(CH3)-**: A carbon atom with one hydrogen and one methyl (CH3) group, connected by single bonds. This part has 2 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n*   **-CH2-**: Another methylene group with 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n*   **-CH=**: A carbon atom with one hydrogen, connected by a single bond and a double bond. This part has 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n*   **=C(CH3)2**: A carbon atom participating in a double bond and connected to two methyl groups. This part has 3 carbons and 6 hydrogens.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   **Total Carbon (C) atoms**: 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H) atoms**: 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNow, let's count the bonds in the molecule C12H22:\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly indicates two carbon-carbon double bonds (`=`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: We can find the number of C-C single bonds using the total number of bonds in an acyclic molecule, which is (Total Atoms - 1).\n    *   Total atoms = 12 (C) + 22 (H) = 34\n    *   Total bonds = 34 - 1 = 33\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = Total bonds - (Number of C=C bonds) - (Number of C-H bonds)\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = 33 - 2 - 22 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy required to break all of its bonds.\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 bonds * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 bonds * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 bonds * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard state (C(graphite) and H2(g)).\n*   For Carbon: 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   For Hydrogen: The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol, which is for the reaction H2 -> 2H. The enthalpy of atomization for one mole of H atoms is half of this value (50 kJ/mol).\n    *   22 mol * 50 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the elements and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n*   ΔHf = Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements) - Enthalpy of Atomization (Compound)\n*   ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Convert the Answer to the Correct Units**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/g and kJ/mol. Our calculated answer is 1900 kJ/mol, which is not an exact option. Let's convert it to kJ/g.\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.01) + (22 * 1.008) ≈ 166.36 g/mol. For this problem, we can approximate using integer masses: 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol.\n*   ΔHf in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
