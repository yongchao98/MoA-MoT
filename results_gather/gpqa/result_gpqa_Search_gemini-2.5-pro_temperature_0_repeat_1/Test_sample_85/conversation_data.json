    "The initial analysis of the reaction mechanisms and stereochemistry appears correct. The search results confirm the key selectivities of the reducing agents.\n\n*   **LiBH4:** Lithium borohydride is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4 but weaker than LiAlH4. The search results confirm that LiBH4 will reduce the ester group of the starting material, leaving the carboxylic acid available for the subsequent lactonization.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Borane is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. This confirms that in Reaction 2, the carboxylic acid group will be reduced to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group to participate in the lactonization.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the reactions is also straightforward.\n*   The reduction of the ester (with LiBH4) or the carboxylic acid (with BH3) occurs at a non-chiral center (C5 or C1, respectively).\n*   The chiral center is at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone product).\n*   The subsequent intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) is an S_N2-like reaction (nucleophilic acyl substitution) that does not involve the chiral center. Therefore, the configuration of the chiral center is retained throughout the reaction sequence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Reaction A:** To obtain (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material must have the (R) configuration. LiBH4 reduces the ester, and the resulting hydroxy acid cyclizes. Thus, A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   **Reaction B:** To obtain (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material must have the (S) configuration. BH3 reduces the carboxylic acid, and the resulting hydroxy ester cyclizes. Thus, B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis matches the initial analysis. The correct option is B.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) A = (S), B = (S) -> Incorrect\nB) A = (R), B = (S) -> Correct\nC) A = (R), B = (R) -> Incorrect\nD) A = (S), B = (R) -> Incorrect\n\nThe logic holds. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Derivations:**\n\n**Reaction A:**\n1.  **Starting Material A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n2.  The starting material is a derivative of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester group (-COO-isobutyl) at the other. The chiral center is at carbon 3.\n3.  Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n4.  Therefore, LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol (a 1,5-hydroxypentanoic acid derivative).\n    *   HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl --(LiBH4)--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n5.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the carboxylic acid group and the newly formed hydroxyl group. This forms a stable six-membered ring lactone.\n6.  The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product, (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, directly reflects the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n7.  Thus, starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n1.  **Starting Material B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n2.  The starting material B is also a derivative of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n3.  Borane (BH3) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n4.  Therefore, BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact.\n    *   HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl --(BH3)--> HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl\n5.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed primary alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the six-membered lactone.\n6.  Again, the reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center. The configuration is retained.\n7.  Therefore, to produce (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
