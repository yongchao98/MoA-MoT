    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates. The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nThe transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ). From these, we can derive r^2 = x^2 + y^2 and x^2 = r^2 cos^2(θ).\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy equation, we get:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 (4k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis potential is recognizable as the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable.\n\nThe energy for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(q) = 1/2 mω^2q^2 is given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where ω = sqrt(k_eff/m).\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction, the effective spring constant is k_x = 4k. The angular frequency is therefore:\nω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\nThe energy for the x-component is:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction, the effective spring constant is k_y = k. The angular frequency is:\nω_y = sqrt(k/m)\nThe energy for the y-component is:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies for the two independent motions.\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = 2(n_x + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
