    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the electric field at point P:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction in the Cavity:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity attracts free electrons from the conductor to the inner surface of the cavity. This results in an induced charge of `-q` on the surface of the spherical cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall neutral charge, a positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the electric field outside the conductor is determined only by the charge on its outer surface. The specific location of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the resulting non-uniform distribution of the `-q` charge on the cavity's inner surface do not affect the electric field outside the main conducting sphere.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the spherical shape of the conductor and the absence of any other external electric fields, the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface will spread out uniformly.\n\n5.  **Applying Gauss's Law:** For a point P outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, Gauss's law states that the electric field is the same as that of a point charge with a total charge equal to the charge on the sphere, located at its center.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The distance from the center of the spherical conductor to point P is `L`. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe parameters `r` (radius of the cavity), `s` (distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center), `l` (distance of P from the cavity's center), and `Î¸` (the angle between `l` and `s`) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
