    "To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy gain per revolution.**\n    In a synchrocyclotron, a particle is accelerated twice per revolution as it crosses the gap between the dees. The energy gained during each crossing depends on the accelerating voltage at that instant. The problem provides the alternating voltage as a function of time:\n    `U(t) = U₀ * cos(2πν(α)t + Φ₀)`\n\n    The energy gained per acceleration is given by `ΔE = q * U(t)`, where `q` is the charge of the proton (which is equal to the elementary charge, `e`). For the calculation, we assume the proton is accelerated at a constant \"synchronous phase\" `Φs`. The problem provides an initial phase `Φ₀ = π/4`, which we will use as this synchronous phase.\n\n    The energy gain per crossing is:\n    `ΔE_crossing = e * U₀ * cos(Φ₀)`\n\n    Since the proton is accelerated twice per revolution, the total energy gain per revolution (`ΔE_rev`) is:\n    `ΔE_rev = 2 * e * U₀ * cos(Φ₀)`\n\n2.  **Substitute the given values.**\n    *   Peak voltage, `U₀ = 190 kV = 190 * 10³ V`\n    *   Phase, `Φ₀ = π/4`\n    *   The charge of the proton, `e`, can be left as is, since we will work in electron-volts (eV).\n\n    The energy gain per revolution in eV is:\n    `ΔE_rev = 2 * (190 * 10³ eV) * cos(π/4)`\n    `ΔE_rev = 380,000 * (1/√2) eV`\n    `ΔE_rev ≈ 268,700 eV` or `268.7 keV`\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of revolutions.**\n    The total number of revolutions (`N`) is the final kinetic energy (`T_f`) divided by the energy gained per revolution (`ΔE_rev`).\n\n    *   Final kinetic energy, `T_f = 950 MeV = 950 * 10⁶ eV`\n\n    `N = T_f / ΔE_rev`\n    `N = (950 * 10⁶ eV) / (380,000 * cos(π/4) eV)`\n    `N = 950,000,000 / (380,000 / √2)`\n    `N = (9500000 * √2) / 3800`\n    `N = (95000 * √2) / 38`\n    `N ≈ (95000 * 1.41421) / 38`\n    `N ≈ 134350 / 38`\n    `N ≈ 3535.5`\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The calculated number of revolutions is approximately 3535.5. This value is closest to option D.\n\n    A) 2500\n    B) 1864\n    C) 5300\n    D) 3536\n\nRounding the result to the nearest whole number gives 3536.\n\n<<<D>>>"
