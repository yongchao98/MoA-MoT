    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scenario to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2:\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ), according to the formula: λ = 1 / (n * σ). A larger collision cross-section (a higher probability of collision) results in a shorter mean free path.\n\n2.  **Analyzing λ1 (Gas Molecule MFP):**\n    *   λ1 represents the mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding with *each other*.\n    *   In this case, both the moving particle and the target particle are gas molecules.\n    *   The collision cross-section, σ₁, is for a molecule-molecule interaction. In a simplified hard-sphere model where molecules have a diameter 'd', the effective cross-section for a collision is σ₁ ≈ πd². A more accurate model that accounts for the motion of all particles gives the formula λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * πd²).\n\n3.  **Analyzing λ2 (Electron MFP):**\n    *   λ2 represents the mean free path of the beam electrons scattering off the residual gas molecules.\n    *   Here, the moving particles are electrons, and the target particles are the gas molecules.\n    *   The number density 'n' of the gas molecules remains the same as in the first scenario because the vacuum conditions (pressure, temperature, volume) have not changed.\n    *   The crucial difference lies in the collision cross-section, σ₂. This is the cross-section for an electron-molecule collision.\n\n4.  **Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections (σ₁ vs. σ₂):**\n    *   The collision cross-section for two molecules (relevant for λ₁) is determined by their combined size. The molecules effectively present a larger target to each other.\n    *   The collision cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule (relevant for λ₂) is determined by the \"size\" of the molecule as seen by the much smaller, point-like electron.\n    *   Generally, the effective area for a molecule-molecule collision is significantly larger than the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron interacting with a single molecule. In other words, σ₁ (molecule-molecule) > σ₂ (electron-molecule).\n\n5.  **Drawing the Conclusion:**\n    *   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), and the number density (n) is constant:\n    *   A larger cross-section (σ₁) leads to a shorter mean free path (λ₁).\n    *   A smaller cross-section (σ₂) leads to a longer mean free path (λ₂).\n    *   Because σ₁ > σ₂, it follows directly that λ₁ < λ₂. The electrons can travel, on average, a much longer distance than the gas molecules before a collision occurs.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1: This contradicts our finding.\n    *   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This states that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1, which aligns perfectly with our physical reasoning. Simple kinetic theory models suggest λ2 could be several times larger than λ1.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1: This is incorrect as the two collision processes are physically distinct.\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This suggests that λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1. This is unlikely, as the difference in the nature of the colliding particles (molecule vs. electron) leads to a more substantial difference in their mean free paths.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that the mean free path for electrons scattering off gas molecules is significantly greater than the mean free path for gas molecules scattering off each other.\n\n<<<B>>>"
