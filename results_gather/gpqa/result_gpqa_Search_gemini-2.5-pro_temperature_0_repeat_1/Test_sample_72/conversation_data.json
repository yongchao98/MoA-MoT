    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Relative Speed\n\nTo find the relative speed of the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let the velocities of the two astronauts be v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. The formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) when both objects are moving in the same direction is:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Energy\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass (m1) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v1) = 0.6c\n*   Lorentz factor (γ1) = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Energy (E1) = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass (m2) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v2) = 0.5c\n*   Lorentz factor (γ2) = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547\n*   Energy (E2) = γ2 * m2 * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total System Energy:**\n*   E_total = E1 + E2\n*   E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²\n*   E_total = 5.964 mc²\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy of the system is approximately 5.96 mc². This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
