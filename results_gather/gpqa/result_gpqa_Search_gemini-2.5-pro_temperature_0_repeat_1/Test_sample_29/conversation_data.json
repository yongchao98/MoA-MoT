    "A textile dye that emits light is undergoing a process called fluorescence. In this process, the molecule absorbs a photon of light, which excites its electrons to a higher energy state. The molecule then loses a small amount of energy through non-radiative means (like vibrations) before emitting a new photon of light to return to its ground state.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the color of the absorbed light:\n\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:** The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The relationship between energy (E) in electron volts (eV) and wavelength (λ) in nanometers (nm) can be approximated by the formula:\n    λ ≈ 1240 / E\n    λ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV\n    λ ≈ 530 nm\n\n2.  **Determine the color of the emitted light:** A wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to **green** light in the visible spectrum.\n\n3.  **Apply the principle of fluorescence (Stokes Shift):** A key principle of fluorescence is that the emitted light always has a lower energy (and therefore a longer wavelength) than the absorbed light. This is because some energy is invariably lost before the emission occurs. Therefore, the dye must absorb light with a wavelength shorter than 530 nm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   A) Red light has a wavelength of approximately 620–750 nm, which is longer than 530 nm.\n    *   B) Blue light has a wavelength of approximately 450–495 nm, which is shorter than 530 nm.\n    *   C) Violet light has a wavelength of approximately 380–450 nm, which is shorter than 530 nm.\n    *   D) Yellow light has a wavelength of approximately 570–590 nm, which is longer than 530 nm.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the principle of Stokes shift, the absorbed light must have a shorter wavelength than the emitted green light. This eliminates red and yellow as possibilities. Both blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths. However, in many common organic fluorescent dyes, the absorption and emission peaks are relatively close. A well-known example is the dye fluorescein, which absorbs blue light (around 490 nm) and emits green light (around 515-520 nm). This makes blue the most plausible color of light absorbed to produce green fluorescence.\n\nTherefore, the organic compound absorbs blue light.\n\n<<<B>>>"
