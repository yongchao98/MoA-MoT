    "Assuming stars are distributed uniformly throughout space, we can determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax and the parallax itself. Here is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution**: The assumption of a uniform distribution means that the number of stars within a given volume of space is constant. Let's denote this constant star density as ρ (rho).\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Spherical Shell**: Consider a thin spherical shell of radius *d* and thickness *dd* centered on the observer. The volume of this shell (dV) is approximately its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (dd):\n    dV = 4πd² * dd\n\n    The number of stars (dN) within this shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the star density:\n    dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd\n\n3.  **Relationship between Distance and Parallax**: Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. This relationship can be expressed as:\n    d = 1/plx\n\n4.  **Expressing Distance and its Differential in Terms of Parallax**: To find how the number of stars changes with parallax, we need to substitute *d* and *dd* in the equation for dN with expressions involving *plx*.\n    *   First, we square the distance equation:\n        d² = (1/plx)² = 1/plx²\n    *   Next, we find the differential of the distance, *dd*, by differentiating the distance-parallax equation with respect to *plx*:\n        dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n        dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)\n        Since we are interested in the magnitude, we can ignore the negative sign, which simply indicates that distance decreases as parallax increases.\n\n5.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation**: Now we substitute the expressions for d² and dd into our equation for the number of stars, dN:\n    dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)\n    dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n6.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/d(plx)), we simply divide by d(plx):\n    dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nThis result shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
