    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 5. This is characteristic of a benzene ring (4 degrees) plus one additional double bond or ring.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet for two protons that is coupled to the aldehyde proton (as indicated by the aldehyde's triplet splitting). This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments, the starting compound is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The molecular formula C8H9NO matches this structure.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻), forming 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O, Heat:** Treating the diazonium salt with water and heat results in its hydrolysis to a phenol. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product at this stage is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (potassium hydroxide) and heat. This compound has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), which are the classic requirements for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n    *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The term \"condensation\" implies the subsequent loss of a water molecule. The presence of heat strongly favors this dehydration step. The initial aldol addition product eliminates water to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe aldol condensation of two molecules of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde proceeds as follows:\n1.  An initial aldol addition yields 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option D).\n2.  Under heat, this intermediate readily dehydrates by losing the -OH group from carbon-3 and a proton from the acidic carbon-2 position.\n3.  This elimination creates a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, which is conjugated with both the aldehyde group and one of the phenyl rings.\n\nThe final, dehydrated product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option A. While option D is an intermediate in the reaction, the specified condition of \"Heat\" makes the condensation product (A) the final major product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
