    "Optical isomerism is exhibited by molecules that are chiral, meaning they are non-superimposable on their mirror images. This property often arises from the presence of a chiral center or an element of axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro and methoxycarbonyl groups) in the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, results in a chiral molecule that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a carbon atom (C2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and thus optically active. It exists as two non-superimposable mirror images, the (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: In benzophenone, the central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the carbonyl group, making it achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism. Although benzophenone can form chiral crystals, the individual molecule itself is not chiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of the dimethyl ester of butenedioic acid. It has a carbon-carbon double bond and possesses both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral and cannot show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>"
