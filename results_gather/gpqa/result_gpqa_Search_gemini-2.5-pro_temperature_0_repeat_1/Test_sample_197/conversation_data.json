    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the free Co(II) ions and all the thiocyanato complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (β):\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nWe can substitute these into the equation for the total cobalt concentration:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe percentage of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is given by:\n% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co) ) * 100\n% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)) ) * 100\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, simplifying the expression:\n% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( β₂[SCN⁻]² / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100\n\nGiven values are:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nNow, we calculate the value of each term in the denominator:\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum in the denominator is:\nSum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe term in the numerator is:\nβ₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage:\n% [Co(SCN)₂] = (0.4 / 2.3646) * 100 ≈ 16.916%\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
