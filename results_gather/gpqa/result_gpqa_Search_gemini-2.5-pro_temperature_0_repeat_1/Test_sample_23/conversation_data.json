    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CnHm.\n\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (m × 1.008) / (n × 12.011 + m × 1.008).\n*   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the equation becomes: m / (12n + m) = 0.1428.\n*   Solving for the ratio m/n gives: m ≈ 2n.\n*   This corresponds to the general formula CnH2n. Since substance Z is fully saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common non-polar organic solvent.\n*   Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12): (12 × 1.008) / (6 × 12.011 + 12 × 1.008) = 12.096 / 84.162 = 0.1437, which is approximately 14.37%. This is a very close match to the given 14.28%.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently identify **Z as cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, and one of them is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated and do not have C=C double bonds (with the exception of aromatic rings which do not react with bromine water).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This means the second component of Y must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from a disproportionation reaction. A classic example of a disproportionation involving a C6 ring is the conversion of cyclohexene to cyclohexane and benzene.\n*   Let's test if the second component of Y is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water. Upon hydrogenation, benzene is converted to cyclohexane.\n\nThis fits all the conditions. Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**3. Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds. This rules out molecules like 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n*   Hydrogenation of both components of X must yield cyclohexane, so they both must have a C6 ring structure.\n*   Mixture X reacts via disproportionation (an intermolecular hydrogen transfer) to form mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene).\n    *   Reaction: Liquid A + Liquid B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   Let's check the atom balance. The products have a total of C12H18. Therefore, the reactants (Liquid A + Liquid B) must also have a total of C12H18.\n*   Since A and B are both C6 cyclic compounds, let their formulas be C6Hx and C6Hy. This means x + y = 18.\n*   The reaction involves one molecule being reduced (gaining hydrogen) and one being oxidized (losing hydrogen):\n    *   One molecule is hydrogenated to C6H12.\n    *   The other is dehydrogenated to C6H6.\n*   Let's consider possible non-conjugated, unsaturated C6 cyclic molecules:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Has two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so it is not conjugated.\n*   Let's see if these two molecules fit the criteria for mixture X.\n    *   Let Liquid A be cyclohexene (C6H10) and Liquid B be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches the products.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction would be:\n        C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    *   In this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses 2 hydrogens to become benzene, and cyclohexene gains those 2 hydrogens to become cyclohexane. This is a perfectly balanced and plausible catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1 (Cyclohexene): C6**H10** → 10 hydrogen atoms\n*   Liquid 2 (1,4-Cyclohexadiene): C6**H8** → 8 hydrogen atoms\n\nTotal hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
