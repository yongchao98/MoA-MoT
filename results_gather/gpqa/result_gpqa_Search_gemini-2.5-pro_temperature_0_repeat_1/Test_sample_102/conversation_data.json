    "The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. Let's analyze the target molecule and the directing effects of its substituents to determine the optimal reaction sequence.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone.\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5, meaning all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nTo achieve a high yield, the substituents should be introduced in an order that utilizes their directing effects advantageously. The presence of three substituents all *meta* to each other suggests that the synthesis should prioritize the use of *meta*-directing groups to control the substitution pattern.\n\nLet's evaluate the two most plausible synthetic routes:\n\n**Route 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is treated with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form acetophenone. This correctly places the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director, on the ring.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone is nitrated using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the 3-position, yielding 3-nitroacetophenone.\n    *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone is brominated using bromine (Br2) and a Lewis acid catalyst (FeBr3). Now, the ring has two *meta*-directing groups (acetyl at C1, nitro at C3). Both groups direct the incoming bromine to the 5-position. This reinforcement of directing effects leads to a high yield of the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**Route 2: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration (as suggested by the start of Option C)**\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone\n3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone is nitrated. In this case, the directing effects of the existing substituents are in conflict. The acetyl group (at C1) directs *meta* (to C5), while the bromo group (at C3) directs *ortho* and *para* (to C2, C4, and C6). While the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, will be one of the products, other isomers will also be formed, leading to a lower yield compared to Route 1.\n\n**Evaluation of the Given Options:**\n\n*   **Option A and D:** These options begin with nitration. The subsequent step in both is a Friedel-Crafts reaction (or preparation for one) on a highly deactivated nitrobenzene or aniline ring. Friedel-Crafts reactions are known to fail on rings with strongly deactivating groups like -NO2 or on amines. Therefore, these options are not viable.\n*   **Option B:** This option begins with bromination, followed by nitration, which produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers, not the required meta arrangement. The subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation on the deactivated 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene would also be unsuccessful.\n*   **Option C:** This option begins with the sequence: i) Acylation, ii) Bromination, iii) Nitration. As analyzed in Route 2, the first three steps of this sequence do produce the target molecule, although perhaps not with the highest possible yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically illogical for this synthesis and appear to be erroneous. However, compared to the other options which contain fundamental flaws preventing the synthesis, the initial part of Option C represents a valid, albeit suboptimal, pathway.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most efficient, high-yield synthesis follows the sequence: Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. This exact sequence is not presented as a complete option. However, Option C starts with a plausible, if less efficient, sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) that does lead to the desired product. The other options are fundamentally flawed. Therefore, Option C is the only choice that contains a correct synthetic route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>"
