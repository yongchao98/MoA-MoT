    "To solve this problem, we will use the principle of conservation of energy, taking into account the formulas of special relativity.\n\n1.  **Define the total energy of the system.**\n    The total energy (E) of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy (K) and its potential energy (U), plus its rest energy (mc²).\n    *   The potential energy from the spring is given by Hooke's Law: U = (1/2)kx², where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from equilibrium.\n    *   The total relativistic energy of a particle of mass m moving with velocity v is E_particle = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). This total particle energy includes the kinetic energy K = (γ - 1)mc² and the rest energy mc².\n    *   Therefore, the total conserved energy of the oscillator system is E_system = K + U + mc² = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx² + mc² = γmc² + (1/2)kx².\n\n2.  **Apply the conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy of the system must be the same at all points in its motion. We will equate the total energy at the point of maximum displacement (amplitude) with the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **At maximum displacement (x = A):**\n        The mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity v = 0.\n        The Lorentz factor γ = 1 / √(1 - 0²/c²) = 1.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: U_max = (1/2)kA².\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        E = (1)mc² + (1/2)kA² = mc² + (1/2)kA²\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n        The potential energy is zero: U = 0.\n        The speed is at its maximum, v = v_max.\n        The Lorentz factor is γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²).\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        E = γ_max * mc² + 0 = [1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²)] * mc²\n\n3.  **Equate the energies and solve for v_max.**\n    By the principle of conservation of energy:\n    mc² + (1/2)kA² = [1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²)] * mc²\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for v_max. First, divide both sides by mc²:\n    1 + (kA² / (2mc²)) = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²)\n\n    Next, invert both sides to isolate the square root term:\n    √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))\n\n    Square both sides of the equation:\n    1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²\n\n    Rearrange the terms to solve for v_max²/c²:\n    v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²\n\n    Finally, multiply by c² and take the square root to find v_max:\n    v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²]\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
