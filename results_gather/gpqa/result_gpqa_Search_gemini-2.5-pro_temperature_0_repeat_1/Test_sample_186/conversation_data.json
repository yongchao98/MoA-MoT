    "Here is an analysis of each star's detectability with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory.\n\nA star is considered detectable if it meets two criteria:\n1.  It must be visible from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n2.  It must be bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure.\n\nBased on the ESPRESSO User Manual, the instrument can achieve an S/N of 10 for a star with an apparent visual magnitude (V) of about 19 in a one-hour (3600s) exposure when coupled with a single 8m VLT telescope. Therefore, any star with an apparent magnitude of 19.0 or brighter will be considered detectable.\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6 degrees south. This means stars with a very high northern declination cannot be observed.\n\n### Analysis of Each Star:\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of about -52 degrees. As a southern star, it is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** Its apparent visual magnitude is -0.74, making it the second brightest star in the night sky. This is significantly brighter than the detection limit of V = 19.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of approximately +89 degrees. Due to its extreme northern position, it is never visible from the southern latitude of the Paranal Observatory.\n*   **Brightness:** Its apparent magnitude is around 1.98.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable** (due to not being visible).\n\n**c) Star with Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15 at 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The star has a declination of 0 degrees, making it observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** The apparent magnitude (m) is calculated using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5*log10(d) - 5.\n    *   m = 15 + 5*log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.0.\n    *   An apparent magnitude of 15.0 is brighter than the V = 19 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15 at 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The star has a declination of 0 degrees, making it observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** Using the distance modulus formula:\n    *   m = 15 + 5*log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5(2.3) - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5.\n    *   An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is fainter than the V = 19 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable** (due to being too faint).\n\n**e) Star with Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15 at 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The star has a declination of 0 degrees, making it observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** Using the distance modulus formula:\n    *   m = 15 + 5*log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5(0.7) - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5.\n    *   An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the V = 19 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15 at 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The star has a declination of 0 degrees, making it observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** Using the distance modulus formula:\n    *   m = 15 + 5*log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5(1.7) - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5.\n    *   An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is brighter than the V = 19 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n### Summary:\nThe following stars would be detectable:\n*   Canopus\n*   Star at 10 pc (V = 15.0)\n*   Star at 5 pc (V = 13.5)\n*   Star at 50 pc (V = 18.5)\n\nIn total, 4 of the listed stars would be detectable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
