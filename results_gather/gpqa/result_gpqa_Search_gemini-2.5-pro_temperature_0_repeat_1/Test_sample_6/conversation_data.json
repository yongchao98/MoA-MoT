    "To determine the energy at which high-energy Î³-rays would have their lifetimes limited by pair production with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we need to find the threshold energy for the reaction $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\nThe threshold condition for this process occurs when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. For a head-on collision between a high-energy photon ($\\gamma$) and a CMB photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$), which provides the minimum energy threshold for the high-energy photon, the condition is given by the formula:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} \\ge (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nWhere:\n*   $E_{\\gamma}$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   $E_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon, given as $10^{-3}$ eV.\n*   $m_e c^2$ is the rest mass energy of an electron.\n\nFrom physics constants, the rest mass energy of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV.\n\nFirst, we need to ensure all units are consistent. Let's convert the electron's rest mass energy to eV:\n$m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_{\\gamma}$):\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question provides the options in Giga-electron-volts (GeV). We need to convert our result from eV to GeV:\n$1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nC) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nD) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
