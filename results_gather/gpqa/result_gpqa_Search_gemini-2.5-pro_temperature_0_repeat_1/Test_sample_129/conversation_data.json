    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds detectable by ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength at which Earth's atmosphere becomes transparent to light and the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength:** The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å).\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff:** Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone, absorbs most of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation from space. The atmosphere only becomes reasonably transparent in the optical window. While some specialized instruments can push further into the near-UV, a general and effective cutoff for ground-based optical telescopes is around 3300-3600 Å. Below these wavelengths, atmospheric absorption makes observations from the ground very difficult.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation:** The redshift (z) is what stretches the wavelength of light from distant objects to longer, observable wavelengths. The formula for redshift is:\n\n    z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\n    To find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we need to use the shortest possible observed wavelength (λ_observed), which is determined by the atmospheric cutoff.\n\nLet's calculate the redshift using a conservative atmospheric cutoff of around 3500 Å.\n\nz = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.88 - 1\nz ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculated value is very close to option A. If we use the wavelength corresponding to a redshift of 1.9, we get:\n\nλ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.9) = 1216 Å * 2.9 = 3526.4 Å\n\nThis wavelength is just at the edge of the near-UV and the beginning of the visible spectrum that can be observed from the ground, making a redshift of 1.9 a reasonable lower limit. At redshifts lower than this, the Lyman-alpha absorption would fall into the UV part of the spectrum, which is blocked by the atmosphere and would require a space-based telescope for detection.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible lower limit on the redshift for these objects to be detected with optical ground-based telescopes is approximately 1.9.\n\n<<<A>>>"
