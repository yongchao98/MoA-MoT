    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n**1. Define the State and Parameters**\n\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n|ψ⟩ = (cos(φ)|α⟩ + sin(φ)|-α⟩) / N\nwhere N is the normalization constant:\nN = √(1 + sin(2φ)exp(-2α²))\n\nThe given parameters are:\n*   Phase: φ = -π/4\n*   Amplitude: α = 0.5\n\nFor these parameters, the state is a pure quantum state. The density matrix is ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|.\n\n**2. Calculate the Entropy of the State (S(ρ))**\n\nThe von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero.\nS(ρ) = -Tr(ρ ln ρ) = 0\n\n**3. Define the Measure of Non-Gaussianity (nG)**\n\nThe relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity is given by the relative entropy between the state ρ and a reference Gaussian state τ. This is minimized when τ has the same first and second moments as ρ. The formula simplifies to:\nnG = S(τ) - S(ρ)\n\nSince S(ρ) = 0, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\nnG = S(τ)\n\n**4. Determine the Reference Gaussian State (τ)**\n\nTo find the entropy of the reference Gaussian state τ, we first need to calculate its covariance matrix, which is identical to the covariance matrix of the state ρ. The elements of the covariance matrix are determined by the first and second moments of the annihilation and creation operators (a and a†).\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** ⟨a⟩ = 0 for this state.\n*   **Second Moments:** We need to calculate ⟨n⟩ = ⟨a†a⟩ (the mean photon number) and ⟨a²⟩.\n\nFor the general state:\n*   ⟨a²⟩ = α²\n*   ⟨n⟩ = α² * (1 - sin(2φ)exp(-2α²)) / (1 + sin(2φ)exp(-2α²))\n\nPlugging in φ = -π/4 and α = 0.5 (α² = 0.25):\n*   sin(2φ) = sin(-π/2) = -1\n*   ⟨a²⟩ = 0.5² = 0.25\n*   ⟨n⟩ = 0.25 * (1 - (-1)exp(-2*0.25)) / (1 + (-1)exp(-2*0.25)) = 0.25 * (1 + exp(-0.5)) / (1 - exp(-0.5))\n    *   Using exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, we get ⟨n⟩ ≈ 0.25 * (1.6065 / 0.3935) ≈ 1.021\n\n**5. Calculate the Entropy of the Reference Gaussian State (S(τ))**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is a function of its symplectic eigenvalue, ν.\nS(τ) = ((ν+1)/2)ln((ν+1)/2) - ((ν-1)/2)ln((ν-1)/2)\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalue ν is related to the determinant of the covariance matrix (V_M) by:\nν = 2 * √(det(V_M))\n\nThe determinant of the covariance matrix is given by:\ndet(V_M) = (⟨n⟩ + 1/2)² - |⟨a²⟩|²\n\nNow, we calculate det(V_M):\n*   det(V_M) = (1.021 + 0.5)² - (0.25)²\n*   det(V_M) = (1.521)² - 0.0625\n*   det(V_M) = 2.313 - 0.0625 = 2.2505\n*   So, det(V_M) ≈ 2.25\n\nNext, we calculate the symplectic eigenvalue ν:\n*   ν = 2 * √(2.25) = 2 * 1.5 = 3\n\nFinally, we calculate the entropy S(τ):\n*   S(τ) = ((3+1)/2)ln((3+1)/2) - ((3-1)/2)ln((3-1)/2)\n*   S(τ) = 2ln(2) - 1ln(1)\n*   S(τ) = 2 * 0.6931 - 0\n*   S(τ) ≈ 1.386\n\nThe amount of non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.38.\n\n<<<C>>>"
