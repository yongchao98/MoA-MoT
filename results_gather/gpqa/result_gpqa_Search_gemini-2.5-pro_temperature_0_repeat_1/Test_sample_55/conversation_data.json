    "The problem asks for the correct decay route and the corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole transitions.\n\n### Analysis of the Transition Path\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$. For a transition to be allowed, the changes in the quantum numbers must satisfy:\n1.  $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n2.  $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe spin quantum number $m_s$ does not change in these transitions.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is a 3s orbital.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   Since the initial orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = l+1 = 1$. This corresponds to a p-orbital.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number $m$ is initially 0. The intermediate state can have $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0 + (0, \\pm 1)$, so $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n*   The problem specifies that the intermediate state is in the $n'=2$ shell. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2,l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Final State:** $|n'',l'',m''\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a 1s orbital.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules from the intermediate states:**\n    *   The intermediate state has $l'=1$. The final state has $l''=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = m'' - m' = 0 - m'$, must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($0, 1, -1$).\n\nThus, all three potential routes are valid according to the selection rules:\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### Analysis of the Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching fraction for the first step of the decay.\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, there is no preferred direction. Consequently, the transition probabilities to each of the possible magnetic sublevels of the final state are equal.\n\nIn this case, the atom decays from the 3s state ($l=0$) to one of the three 2p sublevels ($l=1$, with $m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since these three final states are equally probable, the total probability of the $3s \\rightarrow 2p$ transition is split equally among them.\n\n*   Total number of possible intermediate states = $2l'+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3$.\n*   Probability of transitioning to any specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe second transition, from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$, is the only allowed dipole decay channel for the 2p state. Therefore, once the atom is in the 2p state, it will decay to the 1s state with a probability of 1.\n\nThe overall probability of the two-step cascade proceeding via a specific intermediate state is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe same logic applies to the routes via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. Each has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - **Correct path and probability.**\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - Incorrect probability.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\n\n<<<B>>>"
