    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the energy levels of a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well and then how to fill these levels with four identical spin-1/2 particles according to the rules of quantum mechanics.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe energy for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is quantized and given by the formula:\nE_n = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)\n\nThe problem conveniently defines the unit of energy as E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2). Therefore, the energy of the nth level is simply:\nE_n = n^2 * E\n\n### Filling Energy Levels with Fermions\n\nSpin-1/2 particles are fermions, and they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For particles in a potential well, a quantum state is defined by the energy level (given by the quantum number *n*) and the spin (either up or down). Consequently, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculating the System Energies\n\n**Ground State Energy**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   **n=1 level:** We place two particles in this lowest energy level. Their combined energy is 2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E.\n*   **n=2 level:** We place the remaining two particles in the next available energy level. Their combined energy is 2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy. We create this state by moving one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state (n=2) to the next unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **n=1 level:** Two particles remain, with a total energy of 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E.\n*   **n=2 level:** One particle remains, with an energy of 1 * (2^2 * E) = 4E.\n*   **n=3 level:** One particle is excited to this level, with an energy of 1 * (3^2 * E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. There are a few possibilities for this excitation:\n\n1.  Exciting the particle from n=2 in the ground state to n=4. This is not the lowest excitation.\n2.  Exciting a particle from n=1 in the ground state to n=3.\n3.  Exciting two particles from n=2 in the ground state to n=3.\n\nLet's evaluate the total energy for the lowest energy excitation above the first excited state. This occurs by moving the particle from the n=2 level in the first excited state configuration to the n=3 level, or by exciting a particle from n=1 to n=2. The configuration with the lowest energy will be the one where one particle is moved from n=1 to n=3, while two remain at n=2.\n\nThe configuration for the second excited state with the lowest energy is:\n*   **n=1 level:** One particle, with an energy of 1 * (1^2 * E) = 1E.\n*   **n=2 level:** Two particles, with a total energy of 2 * (2^2 * E) = 8E.\n*   **n=3 level:** One particle, with an energy of 1 * (3^2 * E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the second excited state is:\nE_second_excited = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nAnother possible configuration for the second excited state is having two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=3, which would yield an energy of 2*(1^2*E) + 2*(3^2*E) = 2E + 18E = 20E. Since 18E is lower than 20E, the second excited state energy is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<A>>>"
