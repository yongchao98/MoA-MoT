The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is next to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   The remaining signals describe the structure of the alkyl group:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a single proton (-CH).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons is consistent with the methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton corresponds to the methine (-CH) group. Its chemical shift suggests it is directly attached to the benzene ring (benzylic position).\n    *   **Assembling the structure:** The fragments piece together to form a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃] attached to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Based on the combined spectral data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is to identify the transformation that occurs when 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid reacts with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n*   **Reagents and Reaction Type:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are stable under these conditions and do not react.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Product with the Given Options**\n\nFinally, the predicted product is compared with the provided choices:\n\n*   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches the predicted final product.\n*   **B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   **C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** This is an incorrect structure.\n*   **D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** This has the incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n\nThe final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are deshielded and appear at 8.0 ppm, while the protons ortho to the other (alkyl) group are at 7.2 ppm.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals must describe the second substituent.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3H indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH₂ group.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3H indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH group.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H is a -CH₂ group, coupled to both the -CH₃ at 0.9 ppm and the -CH at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H is a -CH group.
