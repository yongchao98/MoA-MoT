    "This problem requires a two-step equilibrium calculation. First, we need to determine the pH or the hydrogen ion concentration ([H+]) of the buffer solution created by the mixture of H2PO4- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4●2H2O). Then, we use this [H+] to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) from the third dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n\n*   The molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol.\n*   The molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O is 177.99 g/mol.\n*   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3, which is 0.200 L.\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of each salt:\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n    *   This provides 0.007348 moles of H2PO4- ions.\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n    *   This provides 0.005618 moles of HPO4^2- ions.\n\nNext, we calculate the initial concentrations:\n*   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the second dissociation equilibrium (Ka2).**\n\nThe relevant equilibrium for this buffer system is:\nH2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]. We assume that the initial concentrations are approximately equal to the equilibrium concentrations because the dissociation is small.\n[H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M) / (0.02809 M)\n[H+] = 8.10 x 10^-8 M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration using the third dissociation equilibrium (Ka3).**\n\nThe equilibrium for the formation of orthophosphate is:\nHPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n\nNow, we plug in the values we have:\n*   Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12\n*   [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02809 M (from Step 1)\n*   [H+] = 8.10 x 10^-8 M (from Step 2)\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809) / (8.10 x 10^-8)\n[PO4^3-] = 6.24 x 10^-7 M\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # L\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\nExecution of the code yields:\n```\n6.24e-07\n```\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem involves a buffer solution and requires a two-step equilibrium calculation.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\nThe buffer is composed of the conjugate acid-base pair H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O).\n\n*   **Calculate moles of each component:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Since KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely, this gives 0.007348 mol of H₂PO₄⁻.\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Since Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates completely, this gives 0.005618 mol of HPO₄²⁻.\n\n*   **Calculate the concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] of the buffer.**\nThe relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\nKₐ₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]. We assume the initial concentrations are approximately equal to the equilibrium concentrations, which is a valid assumption for a buffer.\n[H⁺] = Kₐ₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration.**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation equilibrium:\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\nKₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nNow, we plug in the known values:\n*   Kₐ₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n*   [HPO₄²⁻] ≈ 0.02809 M (from Step 1)\n*   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M (from Step 2)\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
