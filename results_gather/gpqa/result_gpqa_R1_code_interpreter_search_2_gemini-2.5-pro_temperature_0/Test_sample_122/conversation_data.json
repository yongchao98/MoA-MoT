    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. We need to relate the time measured in the ejecta's reference frame to the time measured in the Galaxy's reference frame to find the distance traveled as seen from the Galaxy.\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   The relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (the proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Understand the physics:**\n*   From the perspective of an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame, the clock on the moving ejecta appears to run slower. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n*   The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n*   The formula for time dilation is: `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n*   The Lorentz factor is defined as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   Once we find the time `Δt` that has passed in the Galaxy's frame, we can calculate the distance the ejecta has traveled in that frame using the classical formula: `distance = velocity × time`, or `Δx = v * Δt`.\n\n**3. Step-by-step calculation:**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    First, we find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light, `β = v/c`.\n    `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, we can calculate `γ`.\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    Using the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (Δx).**\n    `Δx = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n    `Δx = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `Δx = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (dx)\ndx = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"{dx:.0f}\")\n```\n>>>\n3061862\n>>>\n\nThe calculation shows that the distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time given, 50 seconds, is measured in this frame. This is the proper time (`Δt'`).\n\n**2. Identify the Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves a velocity that is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`). Therefore, we must use the principles of Special Relativity. Specifically, we need to account for **time dilation**.\n\nTime dilation means that an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will see the clock on the moving ejecta (S') ticking slower than their own clock. Consequently, more time will have passed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) than the 50 seconds that passed in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`).\n\n**3. List the Given Values**\n*   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Proper time (time in the ejecta's frame), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   Speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**4. Formulate the Calculation Steps**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the measurements between the two reference frames. It is calculated using the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    First, we find the ratio `β = v/c`:\n    `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    Now, we can calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\n    Using the time dilation formula `Δt = γ * Δt'`:\n    `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (Δx)**\n    The distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n    `Δx = v * Δt`\n    `Δx = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n    `Δx = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n**5. Perform the Final Calculation**\nTo get the precise numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (dx)\ndx = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"The calculated distance is: {dx:.0f} km\")\n```\n>>>\nThe calculated distance is: 3061862 km\n>>>\nThe calculated distance is 3,061,862 km. This value is closest to option A.\n\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect non-relativistic answer)\n*   C) 2,940,000 km\n*   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe result `3,061,862 km` rounds to `3,060,000 km` when considering the significant figures of the options provided.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. We are given the time elapsed in the moving reference frame (the ejecta) and asked to find the distance traveled as measured in the stationary reference frame (the Galaxy).\n\n**1. Identify the Given Information:**\n*   The relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame (the proper time) is `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Determine the Physics Principle:**\nBecause the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 0.2c`), we must account for relativistic effects. According to the theory of special relativity, an observer in the Galaxy's frame will perceive time as passing more slowly for the moving ejecta. This is known as time dilation. The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor quantifies the magnitude of relativistic effects. It is defined by the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, we calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light, `β`:\n    `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, we substitute this value into the Lorentz factor formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n    The time dilation formula relates the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) to the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt'`):\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δx).**\n    The distance traveled as measured by an observer in the Galaxy is the velocity of the ejecta (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n    `Δx = v * Δt`\n    `Δx = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n    `Δx = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `Δx = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n    Now, we compute the final value:\n    `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.979796`\n    `Δx ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.979796 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. Comparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 3,000,000 km\n*   C) 2,940,000 km\n*   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
