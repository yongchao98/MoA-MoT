    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), this relationship is expressed as:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n*   **Applying to the problem:** In this context, the lifetime of a quantum state (τ) can be considered as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, each energy level is not perfectly sharp but has an inherent energy width or uncertainty (ΔE) given by:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n*   **Resolvability Condition:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than their energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime will have a larger energy width, and this larger width is the primary factor limiting the resolution. Therefore, the energy difference must be significantly larger than the larger of the two energy uncertainties.\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state.**\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of electron-volts-seconds (eV·s) for convenience.\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **For state 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For state 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the required energy difference.**\n    *   The larger energy uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than this uncertainty.\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare with the given options.**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV  (This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV  (This is much larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV  (This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Only option B provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, as it is the only value greater than the energy broadening of the shorter-lived state.\n\n**2. Python Code for Verification**\nThe following Python code calculates the energy uncertainties for the given lifetimes.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state using the uncertainty principle\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (lifetime {tau1} s): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (lifetime {tau2} s): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nTo be resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the larger uncertainty.\")\nprint(f\"The required energy difference must be > {max(delta_E1, delta_E2):.3e} eV.\")\n\n# Check the options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-9,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-8,\n    \"D\": 1e-11\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > max(delta_E1, delta_E2):\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\")\n\n```\nEnergy uncertainty for state 1 (lifetime 1e-09 s): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty for state 2 (lifetime 1e-08 s): 6.582e-08 eV\n\nTo be resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the larger uncertainty.\nThe required energy difference must be > 6.582e-07 eV.\n\nComparing with options:\nOption A (1.0e-09 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\nOption B (1.0e-04 eV) is a possible energy difference.\nOption C (1.0e-08 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\nOption D (1.0e-11 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Understanding the Principle**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that you cannot simultaneously know the exact energy and the exact lifetime of a quantum state. The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state (also called the energy width).\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which for an unstable state is its lifetime (τ).\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor practical calculations, we can approximate this as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nThis means that a state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly sharp energy level; instead, it is \"smeared out\" over a range of energies ΔE.\n\n**2. Condition for Resolving Energy Levels**\n\nTo clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two separate energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the energy width of the levels. Since we have two different widths (ΔE₁ and ΔE₂), the energy difference must be greater than the *larger* of the two widths to ensure they don't overlap significantly. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width.\n\n**3. Calculations**\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ₁): 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ₂): 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ): 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the energy width for each state.**\n    *   ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the required energy difference.**\n    *   The shorter lifetime is τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s, which corresponds to the larger energy width, ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   To resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be greater than this larger width.\n    *   Required condition: |E₁ - E₂| > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare with the given options.**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV  (This is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV  (This is greater than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV  (This is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy difference large enough to be clearly resolved from the natural energy width of the shorter-lived state.\n\n<<<B>>>"
