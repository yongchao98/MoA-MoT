    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    This implies that the distance `d` can be expressed as:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Consider the assumption of uniform distribution.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars (`ρ`), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant everywhere.\n    `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in a spherical shell.**\n    Let's find the number of stars (`dN`) located in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from the observer, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   The volume of the thin spherical shell (`dV`) can be found by differentiating the volume `V` with respect to the distance `d`:\n        `dV = (dV/dd) * dd = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the constant number density `ρ` multiplied by the volume of the shell `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n    Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) changes with parallax (`plx`). To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with their parallax equivalents in the equation for `dN`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n        So, `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a given range (a magnitude), we can consider the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Combine the expressions to find the final relationship.**\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we rearrange the equation to get `dN/d(plx)`:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion.**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
