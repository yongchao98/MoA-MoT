    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Decode the Chemical Reactions**\n\nThe problem is a chemical puzzle. We need to identify the compounds A through H to find the identity of the target molecule, E.\n\n*   **Clue 3: C + H₂O → A + F + G**\n    *   This is a hydrolysis reaction where product C reacts with water.\n    *   It reforms solid A, and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G).\n    *   The formation of a strong acid from a hydrolysis reaction often points to a hydrohalic acid like HCl. If F is HCl, then C must be a chloride compound, and gas B (from reaction 1) must be chlorine (Cl₂).\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation, where the central element in C is both reduced (to form element A) and oxidized (to form the weak acid G).\n    *   Let's test this with sulfur. The hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride: 2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq).\n    *   This fits the description perfectly:\n        *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride)\n        *   **A = S** (Sulfur, a solid)\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n        *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid, a weak acid, formed from SO₂ + H₂O)\n\n*   **Clue 1: Solid A + 8 equivalents of Gas B → Bright red product C**\n    *   Let's check if our assignments fit.\n    *   A = Sulfur. The stable solid form of sulfur is a crown-shaped ring, **S₈**. So, **A = S₈**.\n    *   B = Chlorine gas, **Cl₂**.\n    *   C = Sulfur dichloride, **SCl₂**. It is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches \"bright red product\".\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry: S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l).\n    *   This shows that 1 mole of A (S₈) reacts with 8 moles (equivalents) of B (Cl₂) to form 8 moles of C (SCl₂). This matches the clue perfectly.\n\n*   **Clue 4: D + B (1:1 ratio) → H (solvent)**\n    *   We know B = Cl₂. So, Gas D + Cl₂ → H (solvent).\n    *   Let's consider a common reaction that fits this. The reaction of ethene gas (C₂H₄) with chlorine gas (Cl₂) produces 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂), which is a common solvent.\n    *   C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l). This is a 1:1 reaction.\n    *   So, let's hypothesize:\n        *   **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene)\n        *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n*   **Clue 2: C + 2 equivalents of Gas D → Extremely hazardous product E**\n    *   Let's check our final assignments with this clue.\n    *   C = SCl₂\n    *   D = C₂H₄\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E.\n    *   This is a known chemical reaction, the Levinstein process, used to synthesize bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: SCl₂ + 2CH₂=CH₂ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n    *   The product, **(ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, a potent chemical warfare agent, which certainly qualifies as an \"extremely hazardous product\".\n    *   Therefore, **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n\nNow that we have identified E as mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S, we need to determine its molecular point group from the given options.\n\n*   **Molecule:** E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S\n*   **Structure:** It has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent (similar to water), and there is free rotation around the single bonds (S-C and C-C).\n*   **Options:** A) C₂, B) D∞h, C) D4h, D) C₂v\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule in a plausible conformation and evaluate the options:\n\n1.  **D∞h:** This point group is for linear molecules with a center of inversion, like CO₂ or H₂. Mustard gas is not linear. So, B is incorrect.\n2.  **D4h:** This point group describes molecules with high symmetry, such as a square planar shape (e.g., XeF₄). Mustard gas does not have this shape. So, C is incorrect.\n3.  **C₂v:** This point group requires a C₂ axis and two mirror planes containing the axis. For mustard gas to have C₂v symmetry, the entire S-C-C-Cl backbone of both chains would need to lie in a single plane. This would create significant steric hindrance and is a very high-energy, unstable conformation. So, D is incorrect.\n4.  **C₂:** This point group requires only a single C₂ (two-fold) rotational axis. Molecules of the type X(YR₂)₂ (like mustard gas or diethyl ether) can easily adopt a stable, low-energy conformation that possesses a C₂ axis. This axis would bisect the C-S-C angle. The two chloroethyl groups would be arranged as mirror images of each other after a 180° rotation, resulting in a chiral (twisted) structure. This is a very common and plausible conformation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy eliminating the other impossible or highly unlikely options, the most appropriate molecular symmetry group for mustard gas among the choices provided is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
