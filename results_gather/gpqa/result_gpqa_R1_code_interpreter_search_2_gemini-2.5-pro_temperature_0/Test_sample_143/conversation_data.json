    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. This is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts and Formulas:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($d$) is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) in the lab frame and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$):\n        $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}}$\n    *   The mean lifetime in the lab frame is subject to time dilation and is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n        $\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n    *   The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n        $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n        where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Combining these, we get:\n        $d = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    *   The product $v \\gamma$ can be expressed in terms of momentum ($p$) and mass ($m_X$):\n        $p = \\gamma m_X v \\implies v \\gamma = \\frac{p}{m_X}$\n    *   So, the decay distance formula becomes:\n        $d = \\frac{p}{m_X} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    *   It is often more convenient to work with energy units (like MeV or GeV). We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$ (the speed of light) to use quantities like $pc$ and $m_X c^2$:\n        $d = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    *   The relativistic momentum term $pc$ can be calculated from the total energy ($E_X$) and the rest mass energy ($m_X c^2$) using the energy-momentum relation:\n        $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2 \\implies pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n\n3.  **List the Given Values and Constants:**\n    *   Total energy, $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Rest mass, $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Decay width, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   A crucial physical constant is $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}$ (where $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$).\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the momentum term, $pc$:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{(8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2}$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} \\text{ MeV}$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Now, substitute all values into the final formula for the mean decay distance $d$:\n        $d = \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} \\cdot \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n    *   The MeV units cancel out, leaving the result in femtometers (fm).\n\n5.  **Use a Python script for precise calculation:** To avoid rounding errors, we can use a script to compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values converted to a consistent unit (MeV)\nE_X = 8 * 1000  # MeV\nm_X_c2 = 1.2 * 1000  # MeV\nGamma_X = 320  # MeV\n\n# Physical constant\nhbar_c = 197.3269804  # MeV fm\n\n# Calculate the momentum term (pc)\npc = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X_c2**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance using the formula d = (pc / m_X*c^2) * (hbar*c / Gamma_X)\n# The result will be in femtometers (fm)\nd_fm = (pc / m_X_c2) * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\n\n# Convert the distance from femtometers to meters (1 fm = 10^-15 m)\nd_m = d_fm * 1e-15\n\nprint(f\"The mean decay distance is {d_m:.4e} m\")\n```\nThe code will execute the formula derived and provide the final answer in meters.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values converted to a consistent unit (MeV)\nE_X = 8 * 1000  # MeV\nm_X_c2 = 1.2 * 1000  # MeV\nGamma_X = 320  # MeV\n\n# Physical constant\nhbar_c = 197.3269804  # MeV fm\n\n# Calculate the momentum term (pc)\npc = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X_c2**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance using the formula d = (pc / m_X*c^2) * (hbar*c / Gamma_X)\n# The result will be in femtometers (fm)\nd_fm = (pc / m_X_c2) * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\n\n# Convert the distance from femtometers to meters (1 fm = 10^-15 m)\nd_m = d_fm * 1e-15\n\nprint(f\"The mean decay distance is {d_m:.4e} m\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe mean decay distance is 4.0645e-15 m\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated mean decay distance is $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m. This value is extremely close to option A, which is $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m. The minor difference (about 0.02%) is likely due to the precision of the constants used when creating the question options. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",

Its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$, the lifetime in its own rest frame) by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor):\n        $\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n    *   The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n        $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n        where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Combining these equations, we get:\n        $d = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for Calculation:**\n    *   It is often more convenient to work with momentum ($p$) and energy ($E$) rather than velocity. We know that the relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma m v$, which can be rearranged to $v \\gamma = p/m$.\n    *   Substituting this into our equation for distance gives:\n        $d = \\frac{p}{m_X} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    *   To work with standard high-energy physics units (like MeV or GeV), we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the speed of light, $c$:\n        $d = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    *   This is the most convenient formula for this problem.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Necessary Quantities:**\n    *   **Momentum ($pc$):** We can find the momentum using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$.\n        Rearranging for $pc$:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n    *   **Given Values:**\n        *   Total Energy, $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n        *   Rest Mass Energy, $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n        *   Decay Width, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   **Physical Constant:**\n        *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}$ (where $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$)\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate $pc$:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{(8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2} = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} \\text{ MeV} = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV}$\n        $pc \\approx 7909.5 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Now, substitute all values into the distance formula:\n        $d = \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} \\cdot \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n    *   The units of MeV cancel out, leaving the result in femtometers (fm).\n        $d \\approx \\frac{7909.5}{1200} \\cdot \\frac{197.327}{320} \\text{ fm}$\n        $d \\approx (6.591) \\cdot (0.6166) \\text{ fm}$\n        $d \\approx 4.0645 \\text{ fm}$\n\n6.  **Convert to Final Units and Compare:**\n    *   Since $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$, the mean decay distance is:\n        $d \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n    *   This result matches the value calculated by the Python script.\n    *   Comparing this to the options:\n        A) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n        B) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n        C) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n        D) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n    *   The calculated value is extremely close to option A.
