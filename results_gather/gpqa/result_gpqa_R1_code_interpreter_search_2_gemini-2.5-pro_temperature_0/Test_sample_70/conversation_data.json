    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2, i.e., T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star = Star's temperature\n    *   R_star = Star's radius\n    *   a = Semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n    *   A = Planet's albedo\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** Let's write the ratio for the two planets, Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_4))^(1/2) * (1 - A_4)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant and cancel out. It also states that the planets have the same albedo (A_4 = A_2), so the (1 - A)^(1/4) terms also cancel out. The formula simplifies to:\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (1 / a_4)^(1/2) / (1 / a_2)^(1/2)\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period:** To find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_4), we use Kepler's Third Law, which states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    P² ∝ a³  or  a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio:** Now, substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods:\n    P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n    From this, we can determine the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the period ratio into the final equation and compute the result.\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nTo get the numerical value, we can use a calculator.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n# The ratio is (P2/P4)^(1/3), where P2/P4 = 2/3.5.\nratio = (2 / 3.5)**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n> 0.829865553125153\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.69\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its distance from the star (semi-major axis, 'a'). The relationship is given by:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet_4 and Planet_2) orbiting the same star is:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\nwhere a_2 and a_4 are the semi-major axes of Planet_2 and Planet_4, respectively.\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a):\n\nP² ∝ a³  or  a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of the orbital periods:\n\na_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods as P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\nP_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nUsing the provided code output:\n(2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83. Comparing this to the options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.69\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
