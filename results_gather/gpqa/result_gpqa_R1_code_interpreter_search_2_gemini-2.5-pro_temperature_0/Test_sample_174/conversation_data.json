    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. For a distribution with a specific geometry, like a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis (the z-axis), the simplest and most dominant form of radiation is electric dipole radiation. We can model this system as an oscillating electric dipole with its dipole moment `p` aligned along the z-axis.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nFor an oscillating electric dipole, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) in the far-field (radiation zone) is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency of oscillation, the amplitude of the dipole moment, and fundamental physical constants.\n*   `θ` is the angle between the direction of observation and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n\nThe radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\nSo, the maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, `A`, is:\n\n`A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * (1)² = C`\n\nWe are asked to find the fraction of this maximum power that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. Let's calculate the power at this angle, `P_30`:\n\n`P_30 = (dP/dΩ) at θ=30° = C * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`. Therefore:\n\n`P_30 = C * (1/2)² = C * (1/4)`\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` is the ratio `P_30 / A`:\n\n`Fraction = P_30 / A = (C * 1/4) / C = 1/4`\n\nSo, the first part of the answer is 1/4.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nNow, let's examine the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength `λ`. The full formula for the power per unit solid angle from an oscillating electric dipole is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * ε₀ * c³) * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`.\nLet's look at the terms that involve `λ`. The power is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nSubstituting the expression for `ω` in terms of `λ`:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴`\n\nThis means the radiated power per unit solid angle is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. This is the famous result that also explains Rayleigh scattering (the reason the sky is blue).\n\nTherefore, a possible form for the function `f`'s dependence on `λ` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining our two findings:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the dependence of the radiated power on wavelength is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
