    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The ketone group at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. Since the starting material already has a chiral center at C5, the attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two different stereochemical outcomes at C3.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5, (S)-5-methoxy, is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two chiral centers, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a meso compound (2R, 4S), which is identical to (2S, 4R).\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are a pair of enantiomers. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture, before separation, contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties, including polarity.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will not be separated and will elute as a single peak. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer to this pair and will have a different polarity, so it will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas and functional groups. They will have significantly different polarities and will be separated from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of peaks is the sum of the peaks from each group of products: 2 (from I) + 2 (from II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers, in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all molecules that are not identical.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the diastereomers from Reaction I: (3R, 5S)- vs. (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomers from Reaction II: (2R, 4R)- vs. (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The chiral column will also separate the meso compound from its diastereomers.\n    *   Since all five compounds in the mixture are structurally distinct stereoisomers, and a chiral column is designed to resolve such differences, each compound will produce a separate peak.\n    *   Total number of peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
