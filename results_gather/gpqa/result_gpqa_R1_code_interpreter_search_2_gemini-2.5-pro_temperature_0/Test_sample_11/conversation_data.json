    "This is a classic two-body decay problem from a stationary parent particle. We will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to solve it.\n\n**1. Define the decay process:**\nThe decay is given by:\nPi(+) → mu(+) + nu\nWhere Pi(+) is a positive pion, mu(+) is a positive muon, and nu is a muon neutrino.\n\n**2. State the given information:**\n*   The initial particle, Pi(+), is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of Pi(+) (m_pi * c^2) = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Rest mass energy of mu(+) (m_mu * c^2) = 105.7 MeV.\n*   The neutrino (nu) is considered massless for this calculation (m_nu * c^2 = 0).\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Since the initial Pi(+) is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles (mu+ and nu) must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\n    Let 'p' be the magnitude of the momentum of both the muon and the neutrino.\n    |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    E_initial = E_final\n    The initial energy is just the rest mass energy of the stationary pion:\n    E_initial = m_pi * c^2\n    The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino:\n    E_final = E_mu + E_nu\n    So, m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu\n\n**4. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest mass (m) by the equation:\nE^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2\n\n*   For the muon (mu+):\n    E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2  --- (Equation 1)\n\n*   For the neutrino (nu):\n    Since the neutrino is massless (m_nu = 0), its energy-momentum relation simplifies to:\n    E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0\n    E_nu = p*c  --- (Equation 2)\n\n**5. Solve for the Energies:**\nWe can now solve the system of equations.\nFrom Equation 2, we have p*c = E_nu. Substitute this into Equation 1:\nE_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\n\nFrom the conservation of energy, we have E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu. Substitute this into the equation above:\n(m_pi * c^2 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\n\nExpand the left side:\n(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi * c^2)*E_nu + E_nu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\n\nThe E_nu^2 terms on both sides cancel out. Now, we can solve for E_nu:\n(m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2 = 2*(m_pi * c^2)*E_nu\nE_nu = [ (m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c^2) ]\n\n**6. Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\nWe will now use a python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n*   **KE of the neutrino (KE_nu):** Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy. KE_nu = E_nu.\n*   **KE of the muon (KE_mu):** The total energy of the muon is E_mu = E_total - E_nu. Its kinetic energy is its total energy minus its rest mass energy: KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\n# E_nu = (m_pi_c2^2 - m_mu_c2^2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nE_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# For a massless neutrino, its kinetic energy is its total energy\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu) using conservation of energy\n# E_mu = E_total - E_nu\nE_mu = m_pi_c2 - E_nu\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKinetic Energy of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (mu+) and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino (nu).

    "The decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu) is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy of the system is the rest mass energy of the stationary pion, E_initial = m_pi * c^2.\nThe final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino, E_final = E_mu + E_nu.\nTherefore, by conservation of energy:\nm_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu\n139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n\n*   For the muon (mu+): E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\n*   For the neutrino (nu), which is considered massless (m_nu = 0): E_nu = p*c\n\n**4. Solving for Energies:**\nWe can substitute E_nu for p*c in the muon's energy equation:\nE_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\n\nFrom the conservation of energy, we can express E_mu as E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu. Substituting this into the equation above:\n(m_pi * c^2 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\n\nExpanding the left side:\n(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi * c^2)*E_nu + E_nu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\n\nSolving for E_nu (which is the kinetic energy of the massless neutrino, KE_nu):\nKE_nu = E_nu = [ (m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c^2) ]\nKE_nu = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\nKE_nu = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\nKE_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2\nKE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n**5. Calculating the Muon's Kinetic Energy (KE_mu):**\nThe total energy released in the decay (Q-value) is the difference in rest mass energies, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the products.\nKE_total = KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2\nKE_mu + 29.8 MeV = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV\nKE_mu + 29.8 MeV = 33.9 MeV\nKE_mu = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV\nKE_mu = 4.1 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. The code output provides a more precise value of 4.12 MeV for the muon.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
