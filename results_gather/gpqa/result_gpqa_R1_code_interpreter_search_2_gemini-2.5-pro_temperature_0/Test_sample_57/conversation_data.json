    "This question asks which of the listed physical theories does not have infinities when calculating physical quantities at high energies (or, equivalently, short distances), thus not requiring a procedure called regularization. Let's analyze each option:\n\n1.  **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory (QFT) describing the strong nuclear force. Like other QFTs in the Standard Model, when one calculates quantities involving virtual particles in loops (e.g., corrections to a particle's mass or charge), the calculations often result in integrals that diverge to infinity. This happens because the integrals sum up contributions from all possible energies, up to infinity. To get meaningful, finite results, a procedure called regularization (e.g., introducing an energy cutoff) followed by renormalization is required. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.\n\n2.  **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the QFT describing the electromagnetic force. QED was the first theory where these infinities were successfully managed. The calculation of the electron's self-energy, for instance, diverges without regularization. The techniques of regularization and renormalization are essential to QED's predictive success. In fact, QED is thought to be incomplete at extremely high energies (the Landau pole problem), reinforcing its need for this mathematical treatment. Therefore, QED requires regularization.\n\n3.  **D) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, governed by Maxwell's equations, is a classical field theory. While it doesn't have the loop divergences of quantum theories, it has its own high-energy problem. If you model an electron as a true mathematical point charge, the energy stored in its own electric field (its self-energy) is infinite. This is a divergence that occurs as the radius of the charge goes to zero (a short-distance/high-energy problem). To avoid this, one must \"regularize\" the theory, for example, by assuming the charge is not a point but is spread over a small, finite radius. So, even the classical theory has a form of high-energy divergence that needs to be dealt with.\n\n4.  **C) Superstring Theory:** This is a theoretical framework that posits that the fundamental constituents of the universe are not point-like particles but one-dimensional, vibrating \"strings.\" A primary motivation for string theory is that it naturally resolves the high-energy (or \"ultraviolet\") divergences that plague quantum field theories. The interactions between strings are not point-like but are \"smeared out\" over a region the size of the string. This smearing effect effectively provides a natural cutoff for the integrals that would otherwise diverge in a point-particle theory. As a result, calculations of scattering amplitudes in superstring theory are believed to be finite without the need for an ad-hoc regularization procedure. It is a candidate for a \"UV-complete\" theory.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nQED, QCD, and even Classical Electrodynamics all feature infinities when considering phenomena at arbitrarily high energies or short distances, thus requiring some form of regularization. Superstring Theory is specifically designed to avoid this problem, making it the theory that, by its very structure, is not expected to require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<C>>>"
