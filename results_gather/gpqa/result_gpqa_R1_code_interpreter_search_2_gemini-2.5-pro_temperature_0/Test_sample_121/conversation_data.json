    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess Sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes a proton from the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups, as this proton is highly acidic. This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess sodium hydride,\" which means there is still base present to deprotonate the remaining acidic alpha-hydrogen on the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        This new carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction).\n*   **Product 4:** The resulting product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n1.  **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOCH2CH3) are different. This means the molecule has no plane of symmetry and is chiral. Consequently, any protons that are not interchangeable by rapid conformational changes (like bond rotation or ring flipping) are chemically distinct.\n\n2.  **Analysis at Room Temperature (Rapid Chair Flip):**\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-to-chair interconversion. This process averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons on any single carbon atom.\n        *   However, the carbons of the ring are in different chemical environments due to the asymmetric substitution at C1.\n        *   C2 and C6 are adjacent to C1 but are non-equivalent because one is \"closer\" to the cyano group and the other is \"closer\" to the ester group in 3D space. The two protons on C2 become equivalent due to the rapid flip, giving one signal. The two protons on C6 also become equivalent, giving a second, different signal.\n        *   Similarly, C3 and C5 are non-equivalent. This gives two more distinct signals.\n        *   C4 is in a unique position, opposite to C1. Its two protons become equivalent, giving a fifth signal.\n        *   Therefore, the ten protons on the cyclohexane ring produce **5 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) Group Protons:**\n        *   **Methylene (-O-CH2-) Protons:** The molecule is chiral. The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to a carbonyl group which is attached to the chiral framework. This makes the two methylene protons diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and give rise to separate signals, regardless of conformational changes. Thus, they produce **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Methyl (-CH3) Protons:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. They produce **1 distinct signal**.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Summing up the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n    *   5 (from the ring) + 2 (from -OCH2-) + 1 (from -CH3) = **8 distinct signals**.\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens. Based on the most likely product and a standard analysis of its NMR spectrum at room temperature, there are 8 distinct sets of hydrogens.\n\n<<<B>>>"
