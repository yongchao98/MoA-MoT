    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Substance Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CnHm.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass Fraction H = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`. Using atomic masses Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   `0.1428 = m / (12n + m)`\n*   This can be rearranged to `m / (12n) ≈ 0.1428 / (1 - 0.1428) = 0.1428 / 0.8572 ≈ 1/6`.\n*   So, `m / n ≈ 12 / 6 = 2`. The empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of 2 is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane CnH2n is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given 14.28%.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and Identify Z**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated (alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's assume C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(C) -> Z`: Since C=Z and Z is a saturated cycloalkane, it does not react. This is consistent.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(D) -> Z`: D must be converted to Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it's not a typical alkene or alkyne. The two main possibilities are:\n        1.  D is a saturated isomer of Z (e.g., methylcyclopentane if Z is cyclohexane). These can isomerize to the more stable Z under severe hydrogenation conditions.\n        2.  D is an aromatic compound that hydrogenates to Z (e.g., benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. This is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In hydrocarbon chemistry, this often involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X (equimolar A + B) is converted to Mixture Y (equimolar C + D).\n*   The simplest stoichiometric representation of this is: `A + B -> C + D`.\n*   Let's consider the two possibilities for D identified in Step 2, assuming the most common cycloalkane solvent, cyclohexane (C6H12), as Z.\n    *   **Case 1**: Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), and D is a saturated isomer, also C6H12.\n        The reaction would be `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H12`.\n        By conservation of hydrogen atoms, if A is C6Hx and B is C6Hy, then `x + y = 12 + 12 = 24`.\n        However, A and B are components of mixture X, which decolorizes bromine water, so they must be unsaturated. They also hydrogenate to form Z (cyclohexane), so they must be C6 compounds. The most hydrogen-rich unsaturated C6 cyclic compound is cyclohexene (C6H10). If both A and B were cyclohexene (which is not possible as they are different liquids), the total hydrogen count would be 10 + 10 = 20. For any other pair of different unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds, the sum will be less than 20. Therefore, `x + y = 24` is impossible. This case is ruled out.\n    *   **Case 2**: Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), and D is its aromatic counterpart, Benzene (C6H6).\n        This fits the properties of Y: {cyclohexane, benzene} is a mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water, and upon severe hydrogenation, both yield cyclohexane. Z (cyclohexane) is a component.\n        The reaction is `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n        By conservation of hydrogen atoms, `x + y = 12 + 6 = 18`. This is a plausible outcome.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   We need to find two different liquids, A (C6Hx) and B (C6Hy), that satisfy the following conditions:\n    1.  `x + y = 18`.\n    2.  Both A and B are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water). This means x < 12 and y < 12.\n    3.  Hydrogenation of both A and B yields cyclohexane (Z). This implies they have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n    4.  There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n*   Let's list the possible non-conjugated unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons:\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). Here, x = 10.\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). Here, x = 8. (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   Let's see if we can form a pair from these that sums to 18.\n    *   If we choose A = Cyclohexene (C6H10), then `10 + y = 18`, which gives `y = 8`.\n    *   This means B must be C6H8. The non-conjugated option is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n*   So, the mixture X consists of A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). This pair fits all the conditions of the problem. The disproportionation reaction is a hydrogen transfer from the diene to the alkene: `C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n*   Number of H atoms in A (Cyclohexene, C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of H atoms in B (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
