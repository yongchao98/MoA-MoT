    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). This can be expressed as the factor `M1 / M2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be determined from its orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of its component stars (K1 and K2). The key formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    (M1 + M2) * sin³(i) = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n    where:\n    *   M1 + M2 is the total mass of the system.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities.\n\n3.  **Use Key Information:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This is a crucial piece of information. For an eclipse to occur, the orbital plane must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. Therefore, sin(i) ≈ 1, and sin³(i) ≈ 1.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula:** With sin³(i) ≈ 1, the formula for the total mass (M_total) simplifies to:\n    M_total ≈ (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n    This shows that the total mass is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n    M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M_sys1 / M_sys2. Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can write:\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³]\n    The constant factor `1 / (2πG)` cancels out, so we don't need its value. We can also use the given units (years for period, km/s for velocity) directly, as they will cancel out in the ratio.\n\n6.  **List the Given Values:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   P1 = 2 years\n        *   K1_1 = 10 km/s\n        *   K1_2 = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   P2 = 1 year\n        *   K2_1 = 15 km/s\n        *   K2_2 = 10 km/s\n\n7.  **Calculate the Sum of Velocities for Each System:**\n    *   **System 1:** K_total_1 = K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:** K_total_2 = K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n8.  **Substitute the Values into the Ratio Formula:**\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (P1 / P2) * (K_total_1 / K_total_2)³\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\n\n9.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\n10. **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is 0.432. This is closest to the value in option C.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculation is performed using a Python script.\n```python\n# Data for System 1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_1 = 10  # km/s\nK1_2 = 5  # km/s\n\n# Data for System 2\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_1 = 15  # km/s\nK2_2 = 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_total_1 = K1_1 + K1_2\nK_total_2 = K2_1 + K2_2\n\n# The ratio of the masses is proportional to P * (K_total)^3\n# M1/M2 = (P1 * (K_total_1)^3) / (P2 * (K_total_2)^3)\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K_total_1 / K_total_2)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe code confirms the manual calculation. The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is 0.432. This means system_1 is actually less massive than system_2. The value 0.432 is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The code output `0.432` confirms the result of the calculation.\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is calculated as:\nRatio = (P1 / P2) * ((K1_1 + K1_2) / (K2_1 + K2_2))³\nRatio = (2 / 1) * ((10 + 5) / (15 + 10))³\nRatio = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nRatio = 2 * (0.6)³\nRatio = 2 * 0.216\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
