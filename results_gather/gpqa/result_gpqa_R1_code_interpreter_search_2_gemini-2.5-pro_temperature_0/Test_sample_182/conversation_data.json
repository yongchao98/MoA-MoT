    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant Molecule**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), although this is not strictly required to find the answer.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring containing one double bond.\n    *   The ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The double bond (C=C) within the ring contributes another 1 to the IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH2)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nSo, the total IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (acid C=O) + 1 (aldehyde C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 5.\n\nLet's also determine the molecular formula of the reactant to be thorough.\n*   The carbon skeleton is a 6-membered ring, a carbon in the -COOH group, a carbon in the -CHO group, and two carbons in the vinyl group. Total Carbons (C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   The product will be a saturated hydrocarbon, so the number of carbons (10) is the most important piece of information from the reactant's structure.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key functions are:\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces oxygen-containing functional groups completely to the corresponding hydrocarbon.\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Ketones (>C=O) are reduced to methylene groups (>CH2).\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Alcohols (-OH) are reduced to alkanes (-H).\n*   Crucially, this reaction does not break the carbon skeleton, including any rings.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of Red P + HI to our reactant:\n*   The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring will have its double bond reduced, becoming a **cyclohexane** ring. The ring structure itself remains.\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **formyl** group will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **vinyl** group will have its double bond reduced, becoming an **ethyl group** (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a saturated hydrocarbon. It consists of the original 10-carbon skeleton but with all double bonds saturated and all oxygen atoms removed. The structure is a substituted cyclohexane.\n\nSince the product is a saturated hydrocarbon with a single ring (a monocyclic alkane or cycloalkane) and has 10 carbon atoms, we can determine its molecular formula. The general formula for a cycloalkane is **CnH2n**.\nFor our product with n=10, the molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated in two ways for the product.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the molecular formula**\n    The formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon C_c H_h is:\n    IHD = c - h/2 + 1\n    For the product C10H20:\n    IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n*   **Method 2: Based on the structure**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n    *   Number of rings in the product = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product = 0 (it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon).\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n    IHD = 1 + 0\n    IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
