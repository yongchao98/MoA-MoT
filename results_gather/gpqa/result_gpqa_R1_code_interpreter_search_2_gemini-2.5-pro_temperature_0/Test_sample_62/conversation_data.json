    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model and Energy Levels:**\n    The problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). The energy levels for this model are given by the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies:\n    E(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)\n    where:\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I), where `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n2.  **Determine the Initial State:**\n    The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state. This corresponds to the lowest possible quantum numbers, so v=0 and J=0.\n    Initial State: (v=0, J=0).\n    Initial Energy: E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final State:**\n    The question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This is slightly ambiguous. Let's consider the possible transitions and their energies:\n    *   **Pure Rotational Transition:** (v=0, J=0) → (v=0, J=1). The energy difference is ΔE_rot = E(0,1) - E(0,0) = 2B.\n    *   **Rovibrational Transition:** According to selection rules for photon absorption, Δv=+1 and ΔJ=±1. Starting from J=0, only ΔJ=+1 is possible. So the transition is (v=0, J=0) → (v=1, J=1). The energy difference is ΔE_rovib = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = ħω + 2B.\n\n    Typically, the energy of vibrational transitions (related to ħω) is much larger than that of rotational transitions (related to B). The transition to (v=0, J=1) would require the least energy. However, looking at the options provided, the momentum values correspond to energies in the infrared range (E ≈ 10⁻²⁰ J), which is characteristic of vibrational transitions, not the much lower energy microwave range of rotational transitions. This strongly suggests the question is asking for the lowest-energy *rovibrational* transition.\n\n    Therefore, the transition is from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon (ΔE):**\n    The energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    ΔE = ħω + 2B\n\n5.  **Calculate the Physical Parameters:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        μ = (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y)\n        μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.\n        Convert to kg: μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        I = μR²\n        R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n        I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m².\n    *   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n        B = ħ² / (2I)\n        B ≈ (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.605 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    *   **Vibrational Energy Term (ħω):**\n        ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = ħω + 2B\n    ΔE ≈ (4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + 2 * (4.605 x 10⁻²³ J)\n    ΔE ≈ 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.000921 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.2189 x 10⁻²⁰ J.\n    (The rotational energy is a very small correction).\n\n7.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p):**\n    The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by E = pc, where c is the speed of light (≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n    p = ΔE / c\n    p ≈ (4.2189 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.406 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s.\n\nThis value is very close to option C. To get a more precise result, we can use a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\nc = 2.99792458e8         # Speed of light in m/s\namu_to_kg = 1.66053906660e-27 # amu to kg conversion factor\n\n# Input parameters from the problem\nMx_amu = 20.0  # Mass of atom X in amu\nMy_amu = 2.0   # Mass of atom Y in amu\nR_angstrom = 2.0  # Bond length in angstroms\nw = 4.0e14       # Angular frequency in rad/s\n\n# Convert inputs to SI units\nR_m = R_angstrom * 1e-10  # Bond length in meters\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the reduced mass (mu) ---\nmu_amu = (Mx_amu * My_amu) / (Mx_amu + My_amu)\nmu_kg = mu_amu * amu_to_kg\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the moment of inertia (I) ---\nI = mu_kg * R_m**2\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the rotational constant (B) ---\nB = (h_bar**2) / (2 * I)\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the energy for the rovibrational transition (v=0, J=0) -> (v=1, J=1) ---\n# The energy of the absorbed photon is delta_E = E(1,1) - E(0,0)\n# delta_E = ( (3/2)*h_bar*w + B*1*(1+1) ) - ( (1/2)*h_bar*w + B*0*(0+1) )\n# delta_E = h_bar*w + 2*B\ndelta_E = (h_bar * w) + (2 * B)\n\n# --- Step 5: Calculate the momentum of the photon ---\n# The energy of a photon is E = p*c, so p = E/c\np = delta_E / c\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"{p:.2e}\")\n```\n> 1.41e-28\n\nThe calculated momentum is 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
