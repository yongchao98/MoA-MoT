    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks us to compare two different phenomena that cause a periodic dimming of a star's light:\n*   **Rotational Modulation:** A star with an uneven surface brightness (due to starspots) will appear to change in brightness as it rotates. The brightness is maximum when the brightest face is towards the observer and minimum when the dimmest (most spotted) face is towards the observer.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passing in front of its star blocks a small fraction of the starlight, causing a temporary dip in the observed brightness.\n\nWe need to find the size of a hypothetical planet (`Rpl`) that would cause the same brightness dip as the starspots.\n\n**2. Model the Flux from the Spotted Star**\n\nThe energy radiated per unit area from a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: `F_area = σT^4`, where `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and `T` is the temperature. The total flux we receive from the star is proportional to the sum of the radiation from all visible parts of its surface.\n\nLet's define the parameters:\n*   `Teff` = 6000 K (Effective temperature of the unspotted photosphere)\n*   `Tspot` = `Teff` - 1000 K = 5000 K (Temperature of the spots)\n*   `f` = 0.20 (Filling factor, the fraction of the spotted hemisphere covered by spots)\n\nWe can analyze the two extreme cases of the star's rotation:\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature of `Teff`. The flux is proportional to the area of the disk (`A_disk`) times the flux per unit area.\n    `F_max ∝ A_disk * Teff^4`\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The visible disk is a mix of the normal photosphere and cooler spots.\n    *   The fraction of the disk that is unspotted is `(1 - f)`.\n    *   The fraction of the disk that is spotted is `f`.\n    *   The total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted and spotted parts.\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * A_disk * Teff^4 + f * A_disk * Tspot^4`\n\n**3. Calculate the Amplitude of the Rotational Modulation**\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the fractional drop in brightness from maximum to minimum.\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n\nLet's compute the ratio `F_min / F_max`:\n`F_min / F_max = [(1 - f) * A_disk * Teff^4 + f * A_disk * Tspot^4] / [A_disk * Teff^4]`\n\nWe can cancel out the `A_disk` term and divide the numerator by `Teff^4`:\n`F_min / F_max = (1 - f) + f * (Tspot / Teff)^4`\n\nNow, we can find the amplitude:\n`Amplitude = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (Tspot / Teff)^4]`\n`Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f - f * (Tspot / Teff)^4`\n`Amplitude = f * [1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4]`\n\n**4. Model the Flux Drop from an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen a planet transits a star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of its projected area to the star's projected area. This is called the transit depth.\n*   Area of the planet's disk = `π * Rpl^2`\n*   Area of the star's disk = `π * Rstar^2`\n\n`Transit Depth = (π * Rpl^2) / (π * Rstar^2) = (Rpl / Rstar)^2`\n\n**5. Equate the Two Signals and Solve**\n\nThe problem states that the amplitude of the signal from the spots is the same as the transit depth from the hypothetical planet.\n`Amplitude = Transit Depth`\n`f * [1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4] = (Rpl / Rstar)^2`\n\nNow, we can solve for the relative radius `Rpl / Rstar`:\n`Rpl / Rstar = sqrt( f * [1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4] )`\n\nLet's perform the calculation using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given parameters\nTeff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nTspot = 5000.0 # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\nf = 0.20       # Filling factor of spots on the spotted hemisphere\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to rotational modulation.\n# The formula is derived from the ratio of fluxes at minimum and maximum brightness.\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)**4)\n\n# The amplitude of the signal is equivalent to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.\n# Transit Depth = (Rpl / Rstar)^2\n# Therefore, we can set the amplitude equal to the transit depth formula.\n# (Rpl / Rstar)^2 = amplitude\n\n# Solve for the relative radius (Rpl / Rstar)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"{relative_radius=}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nrelative_radius=0.3217909259334333\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculation shows that the relative radius `Rpl / Rstar` is approximately 0.3218.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.07\n\nOur calculated value of ~0.32 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to equate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots with the transit depth caused by a hypothetical exoplanet.\n\n**1. Calculate the Amplitude of Brightness Variation due to Starspots**\n\nThe flux (brightness) from a star is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law, `F ∝ T^4`). We need to compare the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us (minimum brightness, `F_min`) to the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us (maximum brightness, `F_max`).\n\n*   **Parameters:**\n    *   Effective temperature of the star, `T_eff` = 6000 K\n    *   Temperature of the spots, `T_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Filling factor of spots on the spotted hemisphere, `f` = 0.20 (or 20%)\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):**\n    When the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, the entire visible disk has a temperature of `T_eff`.\n    `F_max ∝ T_eff^4`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):**\n    When the spotted hemisphere faces the observer, a fraction `f` of the surface is at `T_spot` and the remaining fraction `(1 - f)` is at `T_eff`.\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4`\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation:**\n    The fractional drop in brightness, or amplitude, is given by `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    `Amplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4]`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4`\n    `Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)^4]`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)^4]`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * 0.51775`\n    `Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\n**2. Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Size**\n\nThe drop in brightness during an exoplanet transit (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n`Transit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2) = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\nWe are looking for the case where the transit depth is equal to the amplitude from the starspots.\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2 = Amplitude`\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2 ≈ 0.10355`\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius `(R_pl / R_star)`:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing our calculated value of ~0.32 to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
