    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN is a source of cyanide ions (CN⁻).\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction known as cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This attack breaks the pi bond of the carbonyl group (C=O), forming a C-C single bond and an alkoxide intermediate.\n        3.  The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. In an aqueous acidic medium, the proton source is represented as the hydronium ion, H₃O⁺. This is typically achieved by adding a mineral acid like HCl or H₂SO₄. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile contains a nitrile group (-C≡N).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The conversion of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid group in the presence of water is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either acid or base.\n        *   In acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, a strong acid is used to protonate the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n        *   Comparing the options, HCl is a strong acid, while CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid.\n        *   Strong acids like HCl are standard and effective catalysts for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Weak acids are generally not sufficient to drive the reaction to completion efficiently.\n        *   Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
