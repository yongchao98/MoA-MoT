    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the given information.**\n    The problem states that the number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, as `1/plx^5`. This can be interpreted as the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which is a number density function with respect to parallax. Let's denote this as `n_plx`.\n    So, `n_plx(plx) = dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n2.  **Identify the goal.**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, `r`, per unit range of distance. This is the number density function with respect to distance, `n_r(r) = dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Relate the two densities.**\n    The number of stars `dN` in a small parallax range `d(plx)` must be the same as the number of stars in the corresponding small distance range `dr`.\n    `dN = n_plx(plx) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = n_r(r) * dr`\n    Since the number of stars `dN` must be a positive quantity, we can relate the magnitudes of the densities and the intervals:\n    `n_r(r) * |dr| = n_plx(plx) * |d(plx)|`\n    This gives us a relationship between the two density functions:\n    `n_r(r) = n_plx(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    This is a standard formula for changing variables in a density function.\n\n4.  **Find the relationship between parallax and distance.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely related. For small angles, the formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`.**\n    We need to find the rate of change of parallax with respect to distance to use in our formula from step 3.\n    `plx = r^-1`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r^-2 = -1/r^2`\n    The magnitude is:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2`\n\n6.  **Substitute the known quantities into the density relation.**\n    Now we substitute the given density `n_plx` and the derivative `|d(plx)/dr|` into the equation from step 3.\n    `n_r(r) ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\n7.  **Express the final result in terms of `r`.**\n    The expression for `n_r(r)` currently contains both `plx` and `r`. We need to express it solely in terms of `r` by substituting `plx = 1/r`.\n    `n_r(r) ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    `n_r(r) ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    `n_r(r) ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `n_r(r) ∝ r^3`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance, `n_r(r)`, is proportional to `r^3`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ r^2\nB) ~ r^5\nC) ~ r^3\nD) ~ r^4\n\nThe calculated relationship `~ r^3` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
