    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (DBE=4) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O or C=C bond, or another ring).\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** The chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is highly indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons, which is exchangeable with D2O (implied by the presence of N and O), is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH2).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This proton is the aldehyde proton, confirming the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an amine group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H(4+2+2+1)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This reaction converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The -NH2 group is transformed into -N2+Cl-.\n    The intermediate is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O (Hydrolysis of Diazonium Salt)**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt (usually with gentle heating) causes the diazonium group (-N2+) to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). The -N2+ is an excellent leaving group, evolving as N2 gas.\n    The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    This step involves treating an aldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. The aldehyde, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has acidic α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the -CH2- group). This is a classic setup for an **aldol condensation**.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the aldol addition product. This product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n    4.  **Dehydration:** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loses a molecule of water). The -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and a hydrogen from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final product structure.**\n\n*   The aldol addition product is: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n    ```\n          OH\n          |\n    HO-Ph-CH2-CH - CH - CHO\n                   |\n                   Ph-OH\n    (where Ph = C6H4)\n    ```\n*   Dehydration of this intermediate (elimination of H2O) gives the final condensation product:\n    ```\n    HO-Ph-CH2-C = C - CHO\n                  |\n                  Ph-OH\n    ```\n*   The IUPAC name for this final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This is the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after dehydration (condensation). This is the correct answer.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure; the hydroxyl groups are missing.\n\nThe final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
