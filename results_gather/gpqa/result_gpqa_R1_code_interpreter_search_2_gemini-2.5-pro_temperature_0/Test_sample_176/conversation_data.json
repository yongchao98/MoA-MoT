    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2, which is $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is related to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T) by the formula:\n        $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n        where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature (T) of a black body is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{max,em}$, the peak wavelength in its rest frame).\n        $T = b / \\lambda_{max,em}$\n        where b is Wien's displacement constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect for Light:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$). For a radial velocity $v_r$ (positive for moving away, negative for moving towards), the non-relativistic formula is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} (1 + v_r / c)$\n        where c is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars and taking the ratio, the constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information for the Radius Ratio:**\n    The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 * R_2$, so the radius ratio is $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$.\n    Substituting this into the equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1 / T_2$):**\n    *   The temperature ratio depends on the ratio of the *emitted* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{max,em}$) according to Wien's Law:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = (b / \\lambda_{max,em,1}) / (b / \\lambda_{max,em,2}) = \\lambda_{max,em,2} / \\lambda_{max,em,1}$\n    *   The problem states that \"the wavelengths at which the stars **appeared** brightest... are the same.\" This refers to the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{max,obs}$). So, $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths to find the true temperatures.\n    *   For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s. The star is not moving relative to the observer along the line of sight, so there is no Doppler shift.\n        $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,em,1} (1 + 0/c) \\implies \\lambda_{max,em,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,1}$\n    *   For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. The star is moving away, causing a redshift.\n        $\\lambda_{max,obs,2} = \\lambda_{max,em,2} (1 + v_{r2} / c)$\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$, we can set the expressions equal:\n        $\\lambda_{max,em,1} = \\lambda_{max,em,2} (1 + v_{r2} / c)$\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\n        $\\lambda_{max,em,2} / \\lambda_{max,em,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2} / c)$\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2} / c)$\n\n6.  **Combine and Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v_{r2} / c)]^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (1 + v_{r2} / c)^{-4}$\n\n    Now, we plug in the numerical values:\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n    *   $c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s (speed of light)\n\n    Let's perform the calculation using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants and given values\nR1_div_R2 = 1.5\nvr2_kms = 700.0  # Radial velocity of Star 2 in km/s\nc_kms = 299792.458  # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio of luminosities L1/L2\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + vr2/c)\n# So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (1 + vr2/c)^(-4)\n\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_div_R2**2) * (1 + vr2_kms / c_kms)**(-4)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.229060010952333\n</execute_result>\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculation gives a luminosity ratio of approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.23\n    C) ~2.25\n    D) ~2.35\n\n    The calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n(Note: The information about the mass being 1.5 times larger is extra information, likely to make the solver consider and rule out gravitational redshift, as the M/R ratio remains the same for both stars, meaning the gravitational redshift effect is identical and cancels out in the comparison.)\n\n<<<B>>>",
