    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C).\n    *   The single ¹H peak indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. The shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons in an electron-deficient environment.\n    *   The two ¹³C peaks indicate two types of carbons, consistent with equivalent alkene carbons and equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has two equivalent vinylic protons and a plane of symmetry, leading to the observed simple NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system. It has four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n    *   The molecular formula of the diene is C₉H₁₂.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a new six-membered ring.\n*   The product is a bicyclic adduct. The cyclopentadiene ring becomes a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The *endo* product is usually the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically controlled). This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   The *exo* product is usually the minor product.\n*   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the formation of the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Products**\n\n*   Let's draw the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) adducts.\n    *   The resulting bicyclic system is a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene.\n    *   There are methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C2, C3).\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused at positions C5 and C6.\n    *   There are two protons at C5 and C6, which came from the maleic anhydride.\n    *   There is a CH₂ bridge at C7.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:**\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₂) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₄O₃).\n    *   The problem states the molecular formula is C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This suggests a subsequent reaction, likely hydrogenation of a double bond, has occurred. However, the chemical shifts provided in the options (especially 1.7 ppm for a methyl group) are characteristic of the un-hydrogenated product (C₁₃H₁₄O₃), where the methyl group is attached to a double bond (vinylic methyl). A methyl group in the hydrogenated product would appear at a much higher field (~1.0-1.2 ppm). This strong contradiction suggests the molecular formula given in the problem is a typo, and we should proceed by analyzing the structure of the direct Diels-Alder adduct, C₁₃H₁₄O₃.\n\n**4. Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The question states a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent (or weak) in the spectrum of the **minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* adduct but not in the *exo* adduct.\n*   Let's examine the key distances in both isomers:\n    *   **In the *endo* (major) adduct:** The anhydride protons (at C5, C6) are on the same side as the C2=C3 double bond. They are spatially close to the methyl groups on this double bond (at C2, C3). They are far from the C7 bridge.\n    *   **In the *exo* (minor) adduct:** The anhydride protons (at C5, C6) are on the opposite side of the C2=C3 double bond. They are far from the vinylic methyl groups but are now close to the C7 bridge protons.\n*   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be between the **anhydride protons (H₅, H₆)** and the **vinylic methyl groups (Me₂, Me₃)**.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options**\n\n*   Let's predict the ¹H NMR signals for the groups involved in this key NOE in the major (*endo*) product. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Anhydride protons (H₅, H₆):** These two protons are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups and bridgehead carbons. They will appear as a **2H singlet** at a downfield shift, estimated around **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Vinylic methyl groups (Me₂, Me₃):** These two methyl groups are attached to the double bond and are equivalent by symmetry. They will appear as a **6H singlet**. The typical shift for vinylic methyls is around **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   The NOESY cross-peak should connect these two signals. We are looking for an option that describes a correlation between a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This would be an NOE between a bridge proton (H₇) and the anhydride protons (H₅, H₆), characteristic of the *minor* (exo) product.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: This would be an NOE between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. This interaction is likely present in both isomers and is not the unique feature distinguishing them.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This perfectly matches our prediction for the key NOE in the major (*endo*) product between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: This would be an NOE between a bridgehead methyl group and a bridge proton.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product arises from the unique spatial proximity of the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups in the *endo* isomer. This corresponds to a NOE between a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>"
