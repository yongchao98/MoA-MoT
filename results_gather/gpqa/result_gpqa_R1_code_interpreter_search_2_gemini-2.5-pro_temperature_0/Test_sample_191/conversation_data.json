    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We have an uncharged (neutral) spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive charge, $+q$, is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** According to the principles of electrostatics, a charge inside a cavity of a conductor will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of that cavity. This happens to ensure that the electric field inside the conducting material itself is zero. Therefore, a charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the spherical cavity.\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of $-q$ has been drawn to the inner surface from the conductor's free electrons, a net positive charge of $+q$ must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall charge neutrality. This $+q$ charge will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The charges on the outer surface of the conductor are shielded from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity (the original charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface). Consequently, the distribution of the $+q$ charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the charge within it.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** Since the outer surface of the conductor is a perfect sphere and it is shielded from the internal charges, the $+q$ charge will distribute itself uniformly over this outer surface.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the superposition of the fields from all charges:\n    *   The original charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n\n    However, due to electrostatic shielding, the net electric field produced outside the conductor by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is exactly zero.\n\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the uniform distribution of charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n8.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A well-known result from Gauss's law is that the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the outer sphere is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is $L$.\n\n    Treating the outer charge distribution as a point charge $+q$ at the center of the conductor, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's radius ($r$), its position ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are extraneous information designed to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding. The correct expression for the electric field at P depends only on the total charge that appears on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor ($L$).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. Ignores shielding.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. Ignores the conductor.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. Ignores shielding.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct. Matches our derivation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
