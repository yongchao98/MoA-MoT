    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the partition function Z.\n\n**1. Define the System and its States**\n\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\nEach spin can take one of two values: +1 or -1.\nThe total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\nThe possible states are:\n1.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n2.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n3.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n4.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n5.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n6.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n7.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n8.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n\n**2. Define the Energy Function**\n\nThe energy of the system for a given state is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\n\n**3. Define the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function, Z, is the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor for that state:\nZ = Σ_i e^(-β*E_i)\nwhere β = 1/(kT).\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy for Each State**\n\nWe will now calculate the energy for each of the 8 states and group them by their energy value.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are the same.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1):\n        E = -J[ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J[ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   There are **2 states** with energy **E = -3J**.\n\n*   **Case 2: Two spins are up (+1) and one is down (-1).**\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J[ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State (+1, -1, +1):\n        E = -J[ (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) ] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State (-1, +1, +1):\n        E = -J[ (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\n*   **Case 3: One spin is up (+1) and two are down (-1).**\n    *   State (+1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J[ (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State (-1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J[ (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State (-1, -1, +1):\n        E = -J[ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) ] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   There are a total of **6 states** (3 from Case 2 and 3 from Case 3) with energy **E = J**.\n\n**5. Sum the Boltzmann Factors**\n\nNow we can write the partition function by summing the contributions from each energy level, taking into account the degeneracy (the number of states with that energy).\n\nZ = (Number of states with E = -3J) * e^(-β*(-3J)) + (Number of states with E = J) * e^(-β*(J))\nZ = (2) * e^(3Jβ) + (6) * e^(-Jβ)\n\nSo, the partition function is:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nThe calculated result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
