    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\nTautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). A key requirement for a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent (in the alpha position) to the carbonyl group.\n\n1.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). They do not have any hydrogen atoms that can be easily removed to form an enol. The typical mechanism requires an alpha-hydrogen on an sp³ hybridized carbon. While conversion to hydroquinone (an aromatic diol) is possible, this is a reduction reaction, not a tautomerization equilibrium.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, it does not show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons (C2, C4, C6) is an sp³ hybridized carbon and has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are highly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily shows tautomerism.\n\n**Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The four groups attached to C2 are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, C2 is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A molecule with a chiral center is chiral (unless it's a meso compound, which is not the case here). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbons of the double bond are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers.\n    *   **Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that cuts through the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it cannot show optical isomerism.\n\n**Result for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Combination:**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
