    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference**\n    This problem involves two different inertial frames of reference, which is a typical scenario in special relativity.\n    *   **Lab Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame of the observer.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame, which is at rest with respect to the glass. The glass is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the lab frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities**\n    We need to define the velocities of the objects in these frames. Let's assume the direction of motion is along the positive x-axis.\n    *   **Velocity of the glass relative to the lab (v):** The problem states the glass is moving at a constant velocity `v` in the same direction as the beam. So, the velocity of the S' frame relative to the S frame is `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the glass, relative to the glass (u'):** The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. In the frame of the glass (S'), the glass is stationary. Therefore, the speed of the light beam as measured within the glass is `u' = c/n`. The problem specifies to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`. So, `u' = 1/n`. Since the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass is moving, this velocity is positive.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the glass, relative to the lab (u):** This is the quantity we need to find. It is the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S).\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n    When adding velocities in special relativity, we cannot simply add them as in Galilean mechanics (`u = u' + v`). We must use the Einstein velocity addition formula:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object in the stationary frame (S).\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in the moving frame (S').\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the stationary frame (S).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula**\n    Now, we substitute the values we identified in step 2 into the formula.\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    The formula becomes:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression**\n    To simplify the fraction, we can find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator, or more simply, multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( 1/n + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's compare this result with the given options:\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) 1\n\n    Our result matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
