    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    This means the ratio of the temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift (Δλ). The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) by the formula:\n    K_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n    where `c` is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength. This implies that K_star is directly proportional to Δλ.\n    K_star ∝ Δλ\n\n6.  **Connect Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n    K_star = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    where:\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n\n7.  **Use Transit Information:** The problem states that the planets were also detected by the transit method. Transits are only observable when the orbit is nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination `i` is close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1. We can assume this for both planets. The formula simplifies to:\n    K_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\n8.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio (a_2 / a_1):** Let's rearrange the formula to express `a` in terms of the other variables.\n    K_star ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)\n    This can be rearranged to:\n    sqrt(a) ∝ M_p / K_star\n    Now, let's find the ratio for sqrt(a_2 / a_1):\n    sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(a_2) / sqrt(a_1) = (M_p2 / K_star2) / (M_p1 / K_star1)\n    sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K_star1 / K_star2)\n\n9.  **Combine the Ratios:** From step 4, we know T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1). Substituting the result from step 8:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K_star1 / K_star2)\n\n10. **Substitute Doppler Shift Data:** From step 5, we know K_star ∝ Δλ, so (K_star1 / K_star2) = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2). Substituting this into our temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\n11. **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n    To get the decimal value, we perform the division.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nMp1 = 7.0  # Mass of Planet1 in Earth masses\nMp2 = 5.0  # Mass of Planet2 in Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03 # Doppler shift for Planet1 in Angstroms\nd_lambda2 = 0.04 # Doppler shift for Planet2 in Angstroms\n\n# As derived in the reasoning, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (Mp2 / Mp1) * (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\n\n# Calculate the ratio\ntemp_ratio = (Mp2 / Mp1) * (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet (T_eq) is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere T_star is the star's temperature, R_star is the star's radius, 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and A is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A). Therefore, the formula for the ratio simplifies to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1/a_1)^(1/2)] / [(1/a_2)^(1/2)] = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_1). We can use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, 'i' is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince the planets were detected by the transit method, we can assume their orbits are edge-on, so the inclination i ≈ 90° and sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) by the formula:\nK = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\nwhere c is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. This means K is directly proportional to Δλ (K ∝ Δλ).\n\nLet's rearrange the simplified RV formula to solve for a^(1/2):\nK ∝ M_p / a^(1/2)\na^(1/2) ∝ M_p / K\nSince K ∝ Δλ, we have:\na^(1/2) ∝ M_p / Δλ\n\nNow we can write the ratio for the semi-major axes:\n(a_2 / a_1)^(1/2) = [a_2^(1/2)] / [a_1^(1/2)] = (M_p2 / Δλ_2) / (M_p1 / Δλ_1)\n(a_2 / a_1)^(1/2) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\nWe already established that T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2). Therefore:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
