    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Quantum Mechanical Operator $\\vec{P}$**\n\nThe problem provides the Cartesian components of the operator $\\vec{P}$:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThese are the spin-1/2 angular momentum operators, where the matrices are the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$).\n\n**2. Define the Direction Vector $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector that lies in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. For the vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This can be achieved by setting the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$.\n\nTherefore, the direction vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle the vector makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n**3. Construct the Operator $P_n$ along the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Set up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\nThe problem specifies that the eigenvalue is $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting the operator and eigenvalue into the equation:\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**5. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe can cancel the constant factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation represents a system of two linear equations:\n1)  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2)  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the relationship between $a$ and $b$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta$\n$b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identities $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$:\n$b (2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)) = a (2\\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n\nAssuming $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $2\\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n$b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis gives the ratio of the components:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis implies that the eigenvector's components are proportional to $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin(\\theta/2)$. So, the unnormalized eigenvector can be written as:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\nwhere C is a normalization constant.\n\n**6. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nFor a quantum state, the eigenvector must be normalized, meaning its norm (length) is 1.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$\n$|C|^2 \\left( (\\cos(\\theta/2))^* \\cos(\\theta/2) + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^* \\sin(\\theta/2) \\right) = 1$\n\nSince the components are real, this simplifies to:\n$|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$:\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$\n\nWe can choose the phase of C to be 0, so $C=1$. The normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
