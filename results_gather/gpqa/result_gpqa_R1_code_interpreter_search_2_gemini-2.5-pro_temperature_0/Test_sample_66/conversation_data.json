    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    In this state:\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum of electron 1)\n    *   $l_2 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum of electron 2)\n    *   $l = 2$ (total orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n    *   $m = -1$ (z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    The possible eigenvalues of $L_z$ for a particle with angular momentum quantum number $l$ are $m_l \\hbar$, where $m_l$ can be $-l, -l+1, ..., +l$.\n    For a p-orbital ($l=1$), the possible values of $m_l$ are -1, 0, 1. The corresponding eigenvalues of $L_z$ are $-\\hbar, 0, +\\hbar$.\n    The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    So, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state described by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Relate the Coupled and Uncoupled Bases:**\n    The coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} <l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m> |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$\n    The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|l_1, l_2, l, m>$, and finding it in a specific uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$ is the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $P(m_1, m_2) = |<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>|^2$\n\n4.  **Apply the Selection Rule (Conservation of Angular Momentum):**\n    A fundamental property of angular momentum addition is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a crucial selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    The coefficient $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ is non-zero **only if** $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    In our problem:\n    *   The initial state has $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired final state has $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    Let's check the selection rule:\n    *   $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since $m = -1$ and $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, we have $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$.\n\n    Because the selection rule is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$ must be zero.\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    **Alternative Explanation (Eigenvalue Argument):**\n    The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state we are measuring, $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. Its eigenvalue is $(m_1 + m_2)\\hbar = (-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n    *   In quantum mechanics, eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    *   This means the inner product (the projection amplitude) between the initial and final states is zero: $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n    *   The probability is the square of this amplitude, which is 0.\n\nThe joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>"
