    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's draw its structure and identify the substituents and their relative positions.\n\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern, which is sterically crowded.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), the existing substituents direct incoming groups:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It's very bulky, which influences regioselectivity.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nLet's consider the final step of the synthesis.\n\n*   **Could the last step be nitration?** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene. The powerful activating -OEt group would direct nitration to its para position (C4) and ortho position (C6). The desired C3 position is meta to the -OEt group, so this would be a very minor product. This is not a high-yield route.\n\n*   **Could the last step be Friedel-Crafts alkylation?** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The -OEt group (o,p-director) and the -NO2 group (m-director) both direct incoming electrophiles to positions 2, 4, and 6. However, the bulky tert-butyl group would preferentially add to the least sterically hindered position (likely C4 or C6), not the highly hindered C2 position between two existing groups. Also, Friedel-Crafts reactions work poorly on deactivated rings. This is not a high-yield route.\n\n*   **Could the last step be ether formation?** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol. The conversion of a phenol (-OH) to an ether (-OEt) using Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH to form the phenoxide, followed by EtBr) is a standard, high-yield reaction. This is a very plausible final step.\n    *   **Step vii) NaOH/EtBr** is consistent with this.\n\nNow, how to synthesize the precursor, **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**?\nA common way to make phenols is via the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt, which is made from an aniline.\n*   Phenol Precursor: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n*   Reaction Sequence: ...-NH2 --(NaNO2/HCl)--> ...-N2+ --(H3O+/Heat)--> ...-OH.\n    *   **Step v) NaNO2/HCl** and **Step vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat** are consistent with this.\n\nNow, how to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**?\nLet's renumber this molecule for easier synthetic planning: 1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. This has the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern. It is very difficult to create this pattern by direct substitution onto a simple benzene derivative.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options, as they must contain the correct (or most plausible) path. The options seem to have typos and extra steps, so we must focus on the core chemical transformations.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **Option A & B:** Contain chemically illogical steps, such as attempting diazotization on a molecule without an amine group (A) or nitrating a diazonium salt (B). These are incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. FC alkylation on aniline is problematic; it typically requires protection of the amine or occurs on the anilinium ion (meta-directing). Neither route easily leads to the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern after subsequent nitration.\n*   **Option D:** This option seems the most promising, despite its confusing structure. Let's analyze the sequence of transformations it suggests, even if the order or completeness is flawed.\n\n**5. Detailed Analysis of the most plausible pathway (based on reagents in Option D)**\n\nA viable, albeit complex, route to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with this pattern involves dinitration followed by selective reduction. Let's see if the reagents in Option D fit this path.\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is major, but the ortho isomer is also formed and can be separated. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n3.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** A second nitration. Nitrating o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (C1-tBu, C2-NO2). Both the -tBu group (o,p-directing) and the -NO2 group (m-directing) direct the second nitro group to positions 4 and 6. This gives a mixture of 2,4-dinitro- and **2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene**. Let's assume we can isolate the desired **2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n4.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of a nitro group. In 2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene, the two nitro groups are equivalent. A controlled reduction (e.g., using (NH4)2S, but Fe/HCl can also be used) can reduce one of them to an amino group, yielding **2-amino-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization. The amino group of 2-amino-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Hydrolysis. The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming **2-hydroxy-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson Ether Synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH and then treated with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the ether, yielding **2-ethoxy-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nLet's check the name of this final product according to IUPAC rules. The priority for numbering is -OEt > -tBu > -NO2.\n*   The carbon with the -OEt group is C1.\n*   The adjacent carbon with the -tBu group is C2.\n*   The next carbon with the -NO2 group is C3.\nThe name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This matches the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence of reactions described above successfully produces the target molecule. This sequence uses the reagents listed in Option D. Although the order of steps (iii) and (iv) is swapped in the option text and there are superfluous steps (viii, ix) listed at the end, Option D is the only one that contains the necessary reagents for a chemically plausible synthesis. The other options contain fundamentally incorrect chemical steps. Therefore, despite its flaws, Option D represents the correct synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<D>>>"
