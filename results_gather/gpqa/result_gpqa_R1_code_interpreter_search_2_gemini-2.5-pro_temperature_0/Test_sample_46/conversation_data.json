    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and an amide N-H stretch is typically at a slightly lower frequency.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide (which is usually < 1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a group with two protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3), such as a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This pattern (a 3H triplet) is classic for the methyl part of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a group with three protons (3+1=4), such as a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Combining this with the signal at 1.20 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**, which is part of an ester.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals for 2H are often due to exchangeable protons, like those in an -OH or -NH₂ group. Given the IR data, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield (deshielded) compared to those at 7.0 ppm. This indicates that the ring is substituted with both an electron-donating group (EDG) and an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n        *   The -NH₂ group is a strong EDG, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to ~7.0 ppm).\n        *   The ester group (-COOR) is an EWG, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This compound is also known as Benzocaine.\n\n**5. Verifying the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all spectral data perfectly.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The NMR would show a -CO-CH₂- quartet around 2.5 ppm, not a -O-CH₂- quartet at 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. The IR would show one N-H band and an amide C=O band (~1670 cm⁻¹). Incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide and is meta-substituted. The IR C=O band would be incorrect, and the aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex than two doublets. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
