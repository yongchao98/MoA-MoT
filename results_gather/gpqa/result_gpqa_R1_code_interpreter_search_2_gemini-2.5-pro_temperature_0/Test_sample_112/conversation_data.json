    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic peak for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. In conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound contains both a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) and an alkene functional group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. The presence of these peaks confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n*Conclusion from ¹H NMR:* The compound is an alkene.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common, stable fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as:\n    *   Mass(COOH) = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) ≈ 12 + 2*(16) + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic signature for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ cation.\n\n*Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:* The presence of a carboxylic acid is strongly confirmed.\n\n**4. Synthesis and Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **Functional Groups:** The combined data unequivocally indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n*   **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** We are left with options A (C₆H₁₀O₂) and B (C₆H₁₂O₂). We can differentiate between them using the Degree of Unsaturation, which represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` for a compound with formula CₓHᵧOₙ.\n    *   The identified functional groups require:\n        *   One C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 DoU\n        *   One C=C bond (from the alkene) = 1 DoU\n        *   **Total required DoU = 2**\n*   **Calculating DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches the required DoU.\n    *   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid and does not allow for the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that is consistent with all the provided data: it has two oxygens for the carboxylic acid group, and its degree of unsaturation of 2 accounts for both the carbonyl (C=O) and alkene (C=C) double bonds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
