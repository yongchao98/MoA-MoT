    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and is present as a single enantiomer or in an enantiomerically enriched mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be achiral are the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule has a double bond. The atoms connected by the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E). These descriptors specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The presence of R and S descriptors indicates the presence of chiral centers, and the molecule as a whole is chiral. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is not a racemic mixture. A pure sample of a single enantiomer of a chiral compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule that has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry). A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Such compounds with chiral centers that are overall achiral are called meso compounds. Meso compounds are **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a different stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The (2R, 3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable. As a specific, single enantiomer, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom C1, which is attached to the -OH group, is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH=CH- (ring path), and -CH2-CH2- (ring path). The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the stereoisomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis configuration). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Let's examine the structure for any chiral centers. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and not chiral.\n    *   The CH2 carbon is not chiral.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen atom, a -CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl group, and two identical methyl (-CH3) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   Optically active:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Optically inactive:\n    *   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    *   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
