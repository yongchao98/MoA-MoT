    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the correct statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mott-Gurney Equation and its Context:**\n    The equation $ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$ describes the current-voltage relationship in the Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC) regime. This regime occurs when a large number of charge carriers are injected into a semiconductor or insulator, and this injected charge (the \"space charge\") is what limits the flow of current, rather than the material's intrinsic conductivity or the properties of the electrical contacts.\n\n2.  **Examine the Key Assumptions for the Mott-Gurney Law:**\n    To derive this specific equation, several idealizing assumptions must be made:\n\n    *   **Carrier Type:** The model assumes that only one type of carrier (either electrons or holes) is injected and is mobile. If both were injected (a two-carrier device), recombination would occur, which significantly complicates the physics and leads to a different equation. Therefore, it must be a **single-carrier device**. This eliminates option C.\n\n    *   **Traps:** The simplest form of the SCLC theory, which gives the $J \\propto V^2$ relationship, assumes the material is perfectly insulating and has no electronic trap states within its bandgap. If traps were present, they would capture some of the injected carriers, creating additional space charge that does not contribute to the current. This would alter the relationship between J and V. Therefore, the model is for a **trap-free** device.\n\n    *   **Contacts:** For SCLC to be the limiting factor, the contact must be able to supply carriers freely into the device. The current should be limited by the bulk transport, not by the injection process at the contact. A contact that can supply an abundance of carriers is called an **Ohmic contact**. In this context, it means there is **no energy barrier for carrier injection**. A Schottky contact, by contrast, has an energy barrier that would limit injection, leading to a different current mechanism (like thermionic emission). Therefore, an Ohmic contact (or no injection barrier) is required. This eliminates option A.\n\n    *   **Transport Mechanism:** The current is caused by the injected carriers moving under the influence of the applied electric field. This is **drift current**. The derivation of the Mott-Gurney law explicitly uses the drift current equation ($J = nq\\mu E$) and solves it along with Poisson's equation. It assumes that the current due to the random thermal motion and concentration gradients of carriers (**diffusion current**) is negligible compared to the drift current. This is a valid assumption for most practical device lengths and at applied voltages that are not extremely low. Therefore, the **diffusion current must be negligible**, and the drift current is the dominant mechanism. This eliminates option B, which incorrectly states that the drift current is negligible.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   Incorrect. A Schottky contact has an injection barrier, which is contrary to the SCLC requirement of a freely injecting (Ohmic) contact.\n\n    *   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n        *   Incorrect. The SCLC is fundamentally a drift-driven current. Stating that drift current is negligible is a direct contradiction.\n\n    *   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   Incorrect. The standard Mott-Gurney law is derived for single-carrier injection.\n\n    *   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   Correct. This statement accurately combines all the key assumptions:\n            *   \"trap-free\": Correct.\n            *   \"single-carrier device\": Correct.\n            *   \"no carrier injection barrier\": Correct (this is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact for SCLC).\n            *   \"negligible diffusion current\": Correct (drift is the dominant mechanism).\n\n<<<D>>>"
