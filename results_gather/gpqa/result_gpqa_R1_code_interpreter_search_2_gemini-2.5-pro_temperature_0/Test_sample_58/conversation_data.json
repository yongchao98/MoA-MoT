    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid - a weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid - a strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, so moles of H+ = 0.080 mol.\n\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide - a strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), the moles of OH⁻ are:\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Identify the total moles of acid and base.**\n\n*   Total moles of acid = Moles of H⁺ from HCl + Moles of CH3COOH\n    *   *Note: We first react the strong components.*\n*   Total moles of H⁺ (from strong acid) = 0.080 mol\n*   Total moles of OH⁻ (from strong base) = 0.180 mol\n\n**3. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)₂) will react first.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   H⁺ is the limiting reactant. All 0.080 mol of H⁺ will be neutralized.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid + Remaining Strong Base**\n    *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ (from previous step) = 0.100 mol\n    *   CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant. All 0.050 mol of CH₃COOH will be neutralized.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻, which will determine the pH.\n\n**4. Calculate the final concentration of the excess OH⁻.**\n\n*   First, find the total volume of the mixed solution:\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n*   Now, calculate the molarity of the excess OH⁻:\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = 0.04167 M\n\n**5. Calculate the pOH and then the pH.**\n\n*   **pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n*   **pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial moles\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500  # Weak acid\nmoles_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400      # Strong acid\nmoles_baoh2 = 0.3 * 0.300    # Strong base\n\n# Moles of H+ and OH- from strong species\nmoles_h_plus = moles_hcl\nmoles_oh_minus = 2 * moles_baoh2\n\n# Step 2: Neutralization reactions\n# Strong acid vs. Strong base\noh_minus_after_strong_acid_reaction = moles_oh_minus - moles_h_plus\n\n# Remaining strong base vs. Weak acid\noh_minus_excess = oh_minus_after_strong_acid_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 3: Calculate final concentration of excess OH-\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\nconcentration_oh_minus = oh_minus_excess / total_volume_L\n\n# Step 4: Calculate pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(concentration_oh_minus)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH=:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The final pH of the solution is determined by the excess reactant after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each species:**\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = 0.1 M × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n*   **Moles of H⁺ (from strong acid HCl):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ (from strong base Ba(OH)₂):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 M × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ provides two OH⁻ ions per molecule, Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all the available acid, starting with the strong acid (H⁺) first, followed by the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Total moles of acid to be neutralized:** 0.080 mol (from HCl) + 0.050 mol (from CH₃COOH) = 0.130 mol\n*   **Total moles of base available:** 0.180 mol (from Ba(OH)₂)\n\nSince the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.130 mol), the final solution will be basic due to excess OH⁻.\n\n*   **Moles of excess OH⁻:** 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻:**\n*   **Total volume of the solution:** 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n*   **Concentration of OH⁻ ([OH⁻]):**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**4. Calculate the pOH and pH:**\n*   **pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n*   **pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
