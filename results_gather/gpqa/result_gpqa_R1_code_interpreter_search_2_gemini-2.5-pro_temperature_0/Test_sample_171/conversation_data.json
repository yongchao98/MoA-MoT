    "This problem requires us to relate the temperatures of two stars to the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key physical principle to use is the Boltzmann distribution, which is applicable because the problem states the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. Understand the Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states. For an excited state 'j' and a lower energy state 'i', the ratio of their populations (N_j / N_i) at a temperature T is given by:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   N_j, N_i are the number of atoms in states j and i, respectively.\n*   g_j, g_i are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   E_j - E_i = ΔE is the energy difference between the two states.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe term (N_j / N_i) represents the \"excitation\" of the atoms to the level j relative to level i.\n\n**2. Set up the Equations for Star 1 and Star 2**\n\nLet's apply the Boltzmann equation to each star. Let T_1 and T_2 be the effective temperatures of star_1 and star_2, respectively. The ratio of populations, which we can call the excitation ratio R, for each star is:\n\n*   For star_1: R_1 = (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n*   For star_2: R_2 = (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the excitation ratio in star_1 is twice the excitation ratio in star_2:\n\nR_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n**3. Solve for the Relationship between T_1 and T_2**\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for R_1 and R_2 into this relationship:\n\n(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g_j / g_i) is the same for both stars since we are considering the same iron atom transition. Thus, it cancels out from both sides:\n\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\nTo solve for T_1 and T_2, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n\nln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\nUsing the logarithm properties (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(exp(x)) = x), we get:\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n\nΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\nCombine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n\n(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n**4. Use the Given Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference: ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\nThe Boltzmann constant is a fundamental physical constant: k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nLet's calculate the ratio ΔE / k:\n\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\nThe problem is designed such that this pre-factor is approximately 1. Substituting this value into our derived equation:\n\n1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis equation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
