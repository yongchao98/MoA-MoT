    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation, it is often advantageous to work in a coordinate system where the potential is separable. Let's convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    x = r cos(θ)\n    y = r sin(θ)\n    r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))^2\n    Since x = r cos(θ), we can replace `r cos(θ)` with `x`:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential:**\n    Now, combine the terms with x^2 and y^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n4.  **Identify the System:**\n    The simplified potential V(x, y) is the sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where:\n    V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\n    This is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The motion in the x and y directions are independent.\n\n5.  **Find the Oscillator Frequencies:**\n    The standard potential for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) is V(q) = 1/2 mω^2 q^2, where m is the mass and ω is the angular frequency. The energy levels for this 1D QHO are E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω.\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        Compare V_x(x) = 2kx^2 with the standard form 1/2 mω_x^2 x^2.\n        1/2 mω_x^2 = 2k\n        mω_x^2 = 4k\n        ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n        ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        Compare V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2 with the standard form 1/2 mω_y^2 y^2.\n        1/2 mω_y^2 = 1/2 k\n        mω_y^2 = k\n        ω_y^2 = k/m\n        ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy:**\n    The total energy E of the 2D system is the sum of the energies of the two independent 1D oscillators:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y\n\n    Substitute the frequencies ω_x and ω_y we found:\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * (sqrt(k/m))\n\n7.  **Simplify the Energy Expression:**\n    Factor out the common term ℏ*sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    Distribute the 2 in the first term:\n    E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    Combine the constant terms inside the bracket:\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Here, n_x and n_y are the quantum numbers for the harmonic oscillators in the x and y directions, respectively, and they can take non-negative integer values (n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m).\n    Let's compare this with the given choices:\n    A) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
