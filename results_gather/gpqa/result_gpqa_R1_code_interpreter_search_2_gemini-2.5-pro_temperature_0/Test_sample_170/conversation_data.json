    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Question**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing yield of the *para*-substituted product. Since all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material have the same molar mass, the \"weight fraction of the yield\" is directly proportional to the \"mole fraction\" or \"percentage yield\" of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring determines the position of the incoming bromine atom. We need to classify each substituent as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups donate electron density to the ring (activating groups) or are halogens (deactivating but o,p-directing). They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (in Toluene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (in Ethylbenzene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) `-Cl` (in Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, o,p-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring (deactivating groups). They direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (in Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (in Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) `-COOH` (in Benzoic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Substances within Each Group**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce a very small amount of the para-isomer, while substances with ortho,para-directing groups will produce a significant amount. Therefore, the final order will be (meta-directors) < (ortho,para-directors).\n\n**A) Ordering the meta-directors (Substances 2, 4, 6):**\n\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer is very low. The order depends on the strength of the deactivating and meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The `-NO2` group is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The `-COOC2H5` group is slightly less deactivating than `-COOH` because the ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is weakly electron-donating, which slightly counteracts the withdrawal effect.\n\n*   Therefore, the percentage of para-product will be the lowest for the strongest deactivator and increase as the deactivating strength decreases.\n*   Order of increasing para-yield: **4 (`-NO2`) < 6 (`-COOH`) < 2 (`-COOC2H5`)**.\n\n**B) Ordering the ortho,para-directors (Substances 1, 3, 5):**\n\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer is high. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio). This ratio is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing `-CH3` (1) and `-C2H5` (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary factor determining the p/o ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). The increased bulk hinders the electrophile's approach to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. This leads to a higher para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: **1 (`-CH3`) < 5 (`-C2H5`)**.\n\n*   **Comparing with `-Cl` (3):** The chlorine atom is an o,p-director but is deactivating overall. It has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) and a weaker electron-donating resonance effect (+R). The strong -I effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic effect leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Typically, the para-isomer yield for halobenzenes is exceptionally high, often higher than for alkylbenzenes. For bromination, chlorobenzene yields about 87% para-isomer, while toluene yields about 67%.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene will have the highest para-yield among this group.\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: **1 (`-CH3`) < 5 (`-C2H5`) < 3 (`-Cl`)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of m-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of o,p-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
