    "*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound, using the most abundant isotopes, is 156 amu.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes: ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula for the proposed structures. All options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   The molecular weight for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   The molecular weight for C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂ is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158.\n    *   The MS data is consistent with a compound of formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules (dimerization).\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for a carbonyl group that is part of a conjugated system, such as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   This IR data strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This eliminates option B (Phenyl chloroformate, which lacks an O-H group) and option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenolic O-H and an aldehyde C=O, but not the characteristic super-broad O-H of a carboxylic acid). We are left with options A and C, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton, and its singlet nature (s) is expected as it does not couple with other protons. This further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key information is the splitting pattern and integration. We have two signals, each a doublet (d), and each representing two protons (2H). This simple pattern indicates a high degree of symmetry in the benzene ring. A *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring has a plane of symmetry that makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. This leads to a pattern of two doublets, exactly as observed.\n    *   Let's compare the remaining options:\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It would show two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This perfectly matches the observed NMR spectrum. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. It has no such symmetry. All four aromatic protons are in chemically different environments and would give rise to four separate, more complex signals (e.g., doublets of doublets, triplets), not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    All pieces of spectral evidence point to a single structure. The MS shows a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of the NMR shows a simple two-doublet pattern, which is characteristic of a *para*-substituted benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all of these criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>"
