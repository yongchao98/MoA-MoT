    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   A point charge `q` is moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n*   We want to find the potentials at a specific point in space $\\vec{r}$ and at a specific time `t`.\n*   Electromagnetic effects propagate at the speed of light, `c`. This means the potentials at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$.\n*   The retarded time $t_r$ is defined implicitly by the condition that the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is exactly the difference between the observation time `t` and the emission time $t_r$.\n    *   Position of the charge at retarded time: $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   Vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point: $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   Distance between these points: $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   The time delay is $d/c$.\n    *   Therefore, the retarded time condition is: $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$.\n\n### 2. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and are given in terms of the charge's properties at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nThe scalar potential $V(\\vec{r}, t)$ is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t)$ is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$ is the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$ is the permeability of free space.\n*   The term $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source, including the Doppler effect.\n\n### 3. Matching with the Options\n\nNow, let's manipulate the standard formulas to see which option they match. We can rewrite the denominator by finding a common denominator:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstitute this back into the expressions for V and A:\n\n**For the scalar potential V:**\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**For the vector potential A:**\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions exactly match the ones given in option B.\n\n### 4. Verifying the Relationship between V and A\n\nIt is a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ by:\n$\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$\n\nLet's check if this holds for our derived expressions (and for option B).\nStarting with the expression for V from option B:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nMultiply by $\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}$:\n$\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression for $\\vec{A}$ from option B using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, which implies $\\mu_o = 1/(\\epsilon_o c^2)$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o c^2}\\right) qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe expressions are identical, confirming the relationship and the correctness of option B.\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because it uses the static potential form and ignores the retardation effect in the denominator.\n*   **Option C** is incorrect because it has the wrong sign in the denominator. The negative sign is crucial and arises from the derivative of the retarded time.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect both in its form for V and in the relationship between A and V.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
