    "The user wants to determine the kinematically allowed decay channels for a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Interaction\n\nThe interaction between the boson X and a fermion $f$ is described by the Lagrangian:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (\\upsilon + X) \\psi_f $$\nThis Lagrangian can be expanded into two parts:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\upsilon \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f - \\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f $$\nThe first term, $-\\lambda_f \\upsilon \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$, contributes to the mass of the fermion $f$. We can identify the fermion mass as $m_f = \\lambda_f \\upsilon$.\nThe second term, $-\\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$, describes the interaction vertex between one boson X and a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$). This vertex allows for the decay of the boson X into a fermion and its corresponding antifermion, denoted as $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\n### 2. Kinematic Condition for Decay\n\nFor any decay process to be physically possible, it must be kinematically allowed. This means the mass of the initial decaying particle must be greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products.\n\nFor the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$, the condition is:\n$$ m_X > m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\nSince a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$$ m_X > 2m_f $$\n\n### 3. Applying the Condition\n\nWe are given the mass of the boson X:\n$$ m_X = 6 \\text{ GeV} $$\nSo, a decay channel $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$ is kinematically allowed if and only if:\n$$ 6 \\text{ GeV} > 2m_f \\quad \\implies \\quad m_f < 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\nWe need to check this condition for all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons).\n\n### 4. Checking Fermion Masses\n\nLet's list the approximate masses of the quarks and charged leptons and check if they are less than 3 GeV.\n\n*   **Leptons:**\n    *   Electron ($e$): $m_e \\approx 0.000511$ GeV. Since $0.000511 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 0.106$ GeV. Since $0.106 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777$ GeV. Since $1.777 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n\n*   **Quarks:**\n    *   Up ($u$): $m_u \\approx 0.0022$ GeV. Since $0.0022 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   Down ($d$): $m_d \\approx 0.0047$ GeV. Since $0.0047 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   Strange ($s$): $m_s \\approx 0.095$ GeV. Since $0.095 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   Charm ($c$): $m_c \\approx 1.27$ GeV. Since $1.27 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   Bottom ($b$): $m_b \\approx 4.18$ GeV. Since $4.18 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **forbidden**.\n    *   Top ($t$): $m_t \\approx 173$ GeV. Since $173 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **forbidden**.\n\n(Note: Quarks are not observed as free particles due to color confinement, but they hadronize into jets of particles. The decay is fundamentally to the quark-antiquark pair.)\n\n### 5. Compiling the List of Allowed Decays\n\nThe set of all kinematically allowed decays into fermion-antifermion pairs is:\n$$ \\{ X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}, X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}, X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}, X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}, X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}, X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c} \\} $$\n\n### 6. Evaluating the Options\n\nNow we compare our list with the given options:\n\n*   **A) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    *   This option includes the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$, which is kinematically forbidden.\n\n*   **B) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    *   This option includes the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$, which is kinematically forbidden.\n\n*   **C) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    *   This option includes the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ (forbidden) and is missing the allowed decays $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ and $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$.\n\n*   **D) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    *   This option includes all the decays we identified as kinematically allowed and excludes all the forbidden ones.\n\nTherefore, option D correctly lists all the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order.\n\n<<<D>>>"
