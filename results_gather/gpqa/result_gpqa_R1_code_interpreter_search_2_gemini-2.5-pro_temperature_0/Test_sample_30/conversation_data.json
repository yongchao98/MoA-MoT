    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\nThis reaction is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃) has a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a benzene ring. The methyl group is an ortho-, para-directing and activating group for electrophilic aromatic substitution. The reaction with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) introduces a nitro group (-NO₂) onto the ring.\n\n*   The major product is the para-isomer, 4-nitrotoluene, due to less steric hindrance compared to the ortho-isomer.\n*   The minor product is the ortho-isomer, 2-nitrotoluene.\n\nWe will assume the reaction proceeds to yield the major product.\n**Product 1 is 4-nitrotoluene.**\nStructure: A benzene ring with a methyl group and a nitro group at opposite (para) positions.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n\nProduct 1 is 4-nitrotoluene. The reagent is manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an oxidizing agent. In organic chemistry, MnO₂ is known for the selective oxidation of allylic and benzylic alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. It can also oxidize activated methyl groups, such as the benzylic methyl group in 4-nitrotoluene, to an aldehyde. While stronger oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ would oxidize it all the way to a carboxylic acid, the use of MnO₂ commonly stops at the aldehyde stage.\n\n*   The methyl group (-CH₃) of 4-nitrotoluene is oxidized to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   The nitro group (-NO₂) remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, Product 2 is 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n**Product 2 is 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.**\nStructure: A benzene ring with an aldehyde group and a nitro group at opposite (para) positions.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\nProduct 2 is 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. The reagents are acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a classic base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically known as the **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**.\n\n*   Sodium hydroxide (a base) removes an acidic α-proton from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate ion (⁻CH₂COCH₃).\n*   4-nitrobenzaldehyde has no α-protons and cannot form an enolate. It acts as the electrophile.\n*   The acetone enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n*   The initial aldol addition product is formed, which then readily undergoes dehydration (loses a molecule of water) under the reaction conditions to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\nThe reaction is:\np-NO₂-C₆H₄-CHO + CH₃COCH₃ --(NaOH, H₂O)--> p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(O)CH₃ + H₂O\n\nThe double bond formed is predominantly the trans (E) isomer, as it is thermodynamically more stable.\n**Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one.**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of Product 3, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one.\nStructure: p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(O)CH₃\n\nThe molecule has an extended conjugated system (benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). This system prefers a planar conformation to maximize orbital overlap. Let's assume the main skeleton of the molecule lies in a single plane.\n\nWe need to identify the symmetry elements present in the molecule:\n1.  **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n2.  **Proper Rotation Axis (Cₙ):** Is there an axis around which rotation by 360°/n leaves the molecule unchanged?\n    *   There is no C₂ axis. For example, an axis passing through the para positions of the benzene ring and along the chain is not a C₂ axis because rotating by 180° would not superimpose the molecule upon itself (the -NO₂ group is different from the -CH=CH-C(O)CH₃ group). No other Cₙ axis exists.\n3.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Is there a mirror plane that divides the molecule into two identical halves?\n    *   Yes. The plane that contains the benzene ring, the nitro group, the vinyl group (-CH=CH-), and the acetyl group (-C(O)CH₃) is a plane of symmetry. The atoms of the skeleton lie within this plane. The methyl group will have one hydrogen in this plane, with the other two located symmetrically above and below it. This plane perfectly bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves (a top half and a bottom half).\n4.  **Center of Inversion (i):** Is there a point in the center of the molecule such that any atom can be reflected through this point to an identical atom on the other side? No.\n5.  **Improper Rotation Axis (Sₙ):** Rotation followed by reflection. Since there is no Cₙ (n>1), there can be no Sn (n>1).\n\nThe molecule possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ). A molecule with only these two symmetry elements belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) C2h: Requires C₂, σh, i. Incorrect.\nB) D2h: A high-symmetry group. Incorrect.\nC) C3: Requires a C₃ axis. Incorrect.\nD) Cs: Requires a single σ plane. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs.\n\n<<<D>>>"
