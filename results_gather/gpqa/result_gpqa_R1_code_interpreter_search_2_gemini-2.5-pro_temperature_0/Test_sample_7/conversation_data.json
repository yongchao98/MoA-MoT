As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the single-mutant data:**\n    *   Wild-type (WT) has 100% resistance (this is our baseline).\n    *   `g1` mutant has 75% resistance. This means that gene G1 is responsible for, or contributes to, 25% of the total resistance (100% - 75% = 25%).\n    *   `g2` mutant has 0% resistance. This means that gene G2 is absolutely essential for any resistance. Its loss completely abolishes the phenotype.\n    *   `g3` mutant has 50% resistance. This means that gene G3 is responsible for, or contributes to, 50% of the total resistance (100% - 50% = 50%).\n\n2.  **Analyze the double-mutant data to understand gene interactions (epistasis):**\n    *   **Epistasis** is a genetic interaction where the effect of one gene is masked by the effect of another gene. To test for epistasis, we compare the phenotype of the double mutant with the phenotypes of the single mutants. If the double mutant's phenotype is the same as one of the single mutant's phenotypes, then that single gene is epistatic to the other.\n    *   **`g1g2` double mutant:** Has 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance). The effect of the `g1` mutation (which would normally result in 75% resistance) is completely masked by the `g2` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   **`g2g3` double mutant:** Has 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance). The effect of the `g3` mutation (which would normally result in 50% resistance) is masked. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n    *   **`g1g3` double mutant:** Has 10% resistance. This phenotype is different from both the `g1` single mutant (75%) and the `g3` single mutant (50%). Therefore, there is **no epistasis** between G1 and G3. Instead, they show a **synergistic interaction**, because the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects. (Expected additive resistance = 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%. The observed resistance of 10% is much lower, meaning a greater loss of function).\n\n3.  **Identify the likely Transcription Factor (TF):**\n    *   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.\n    *   Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and its knockout (`g2`) leads to a complete loss of resistance, G2 is the most logical candidate for an upstream master regulator, such as a transcription factor, that is required for the entire resistance pathway.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Plausible.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **False**. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n    *   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Unlikely, as G2 is the better candidate. However, let's evaluate the other parts.\n        *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: **True**. As determined in step 2, the `g1g2` phenotype (0%) is the same as the `g2` phenotype (0%).\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **False**. (Same reason as in A).\n        *   Also, the interaction between G1 and G3 is synergistic, not redundant.\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: **False**. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Options A, C, and D all contain statements about epistasis between G1 and G3 that are demonstrably false based on the experimental data.\n    *   Option B is the only option that contains a factually correct statement about the gene interactions: \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\". While the claim that \"G1 is a transcription factor\" is questionable based on the data (G2 is a much stronger candidate), the statement about epistasis in option B is undeniably correct. In a multiple-choice question, we must select the best possible answer. Since A, C, and D are clearly incorrect, B is the only remaining choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
