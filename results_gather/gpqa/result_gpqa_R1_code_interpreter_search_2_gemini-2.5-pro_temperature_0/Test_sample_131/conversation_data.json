    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to identify which pair of compounds from the given options, when mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means that in the 1:1 mixture, the total number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second singlet.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This tells us about the relative number of methyl protons in different chemical environments.\n\n### **3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and the integration for both the aromatic and aliphatic protons of each potential compound. This is done by analyzing the molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, it will be a **singlet**. Integration: **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet**. Integration: 4 x 3H = **12H**.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent (ortho), equivalent protons do not split each other. They will produce a single **singlet**. Integration: **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet**. Integration: 2 x 3H = **6H**.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent. This gives a second **singlet**. Integration: 2 x 3H = **6H**.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A single plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. They will produce two separate signals. Meta-coupling is usually too small to be resolved, so they will appear as two **singlets**. Integration: **1H each**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. One **singlet**. Integration: **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. A second **singlet**. Integration: **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique. A third **singlet**. Integration: **3H**.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, like Durene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four ring protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce one **singlet**. Integration: **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The two methylene (-CH2-) groups are equivalent. They are split by the adjacent methyl group protons into a **quartet**. Integration: **4H**.\n        *   The two methyl (-CH3) groups are equivalent. They are split by the adjacent methylene group protons into a **triplet**. Integration: **6H**.\n    *   **Summary for 1,4-diethylbenzene:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).\n\n### **4. Evaluate Each Option Against the Mixture's Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio and see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio and each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. The mixture will show **three singlets** (assuming they have different chemical shifts). The integration ratio will be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three signals (one 2H, two 1H), not two. This does not match.\n\n**C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three signals, not two. This does not match.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene) and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The spectrum for this mixture would contain singlets, a quartet, and a triplet. The problem states there are only three singlets in the aliphatic region. This does not match.\n\n### **5. Final Answer**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that correctly predicts the observed 1H NMR spectrum for the 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
