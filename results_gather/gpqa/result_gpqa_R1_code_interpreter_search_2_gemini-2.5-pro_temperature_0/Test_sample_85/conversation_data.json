    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a delta-lactone. The structure is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (O1), a carbonyl group (C2=O), and an ethyl group at the C4 position. The reactions yield different stereoisomers, (R) and (S), at the chiral C4 center.\n*   **Lactone Precursor:** A delta-lactone like this is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. Specifically, the precursor is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is C3, which corresponds to the C4 position in the final lactone product.\n*   **Starting Materials (from options):** The proposed starting materials are of the form \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. The structure is `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`. This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). The chiral center is at C3, the carbon bearing the ethyl group.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the different selectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, towards carboxylic acids and esters.\n\n*   **Reaction A: Reagent is LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH4 is a moderately strong reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  LiBH4 will selectively reduce the ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) will remain unchanged.\n        2.  This reduction yields 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n            `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(LiBH4)--> `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n        3.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid to form the final lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Neither the reduction of the ester nor the subsequent lactonization affects the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is directly transferred to the product. To obtain **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n        *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n*   **Reaction B: Reagent is BH3 (Borane)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** BH3 is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. While it can reduce esters, it does so much more slowly than it reduces carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid in the presence of the ester.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) will remain unchanged.\n        2.  This reduction yields isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n            `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(BH3)--> `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n        3.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the reduction of the carboxylic acid and the subsequent transesterification do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained. To obtain **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n        *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
