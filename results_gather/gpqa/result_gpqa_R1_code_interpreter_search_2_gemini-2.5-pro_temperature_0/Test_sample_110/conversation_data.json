    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a substituted cyclohexanone, which can act as a nucleophile after deprotonation.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, a classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Enolate Formation (Deprotonation)**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of the ketone:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-hydrogens**.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C5. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-hydrogen**.\n    *   Since only the C6 position has an α-hydrogen, the base will exclusively deprotonate this position to form the enolate. The double bond of the enolate will be between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition)**\n    *   The C6 of the enolate acts as the nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The nucleophile is the cyclohexanone enolate (attacking from C6).\n    *   The electrophile is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The attack occurs at the β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Protonation**\n    *   The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated (likely by the solvent or tert-butanol formed in the first step) to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   A new group, `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` (from ethyl acrylate), is attached to the C6 position.\n    *   The final structure is `2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)cyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n6.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The names in the options treat the propanoate chain as the parent and the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent. Let's adopt this naming convention to match the options.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment to the propanoate chain is designated as C1'.\n    *   In our product, the attachment point is the original C6 of the ketone. So, C6 becomes C1'.\n    *   Let's renumber the ring based on this:\n        *   C1' was C6 (attachment point, has a methyl group).\n        *   C2' was C1 (has the oxo group, =O).\n        *   C3' was C2 (has an ethyl and a methyl group).\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name for A in options A and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The hydrogens on the carbon bearing the nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic. This will be the nucleophile after deprotonation.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Nitronate Formation (Deprotonation)**\n    *   The base (KOH) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion called a nitronate anion.\n    *   `CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂ + OH⁻  ⇌  CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂ + H₂O`\n\n3.  **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition)**\n    *   The α-carbon of the nitronate anion acts as the nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The nucleophile is the 1-nitropropane anion (attacking from C1).\n    *   The electrophile is but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The attack occurs at the β-carbon (the CH attached to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Protonation**\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The 1-nitropropane fragment is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-`.\n    *   The but-2-enenitrile fragment becomes `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Combining them gives the structure: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n6.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent name ends in `-nitrile`.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group has 6 carbons. Thus, it is a `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        `C⁶H₃-C⁵H₂-C⁴H(NO₂)-C³H(CH₃)-C²H₂-C¹N`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name for B in options A and C.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nOption A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
