    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n**1. Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nIn a conservative system, the total mechanical energy is conserved. For a relativistic particle, the total mechanical energy ($E_{mech}$) is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy ($K$) and its potential energy ($U$).\n\n$E_{mech} = K + U$\n\nThis quantity remains constant throughout the motion.\n\n**2. Relativistic Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy**\n\n*   The relativistic kinetic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving with speed $v$ is given by:\n    $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n*   The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law ($F = -kx$) is:\n    $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\nSo, the conserved mechanical energy is:\n$E_{mech} = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n**3. Energy at the Point of Maximum Displacement (Amplitude)**\n\nThe mass oscillates with a maximum amplitude $A$. At the turning points of the oscillation ($x = \\pm A$), the mass momentarily stops, so its speed is zero.\n\n*   At $x = A$, we have $v = 0$.\n*   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n*   The kinetic energy at this point is $K = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\n*   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n*   Therefore, the total mechanical energy of the system is:\n    $E_{mech} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n**4. Energy at the Equilibrium Position**\n\nThe speed of the mass is maximum ($v = v_{max}$) when it passes through the equilibrium position ($x=0$), where the net force is zero.\n\n*   At $x = 0$, we have $v = v_{max}$.\n*   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n*   The kinetic energy is at its maximum: $K_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n*   The potential energy at this point is $U = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n*   Therefore, the total mechanical energy at this point is:\n    $E_{mech} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n**5. Solving for the Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$)**\n\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy at the amplitude is equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\n\n*   First, isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n*   Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n*   Invert both sides of the equation:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n*   Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n*   Rearrange to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n*   Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
