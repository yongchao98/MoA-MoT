    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H4) that has two groups attached to it.\n*   **Molecular Formula Constraint:** The entire molecule contains 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A peak for a **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n    *   A peak for an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   Based on the FTIR data, one substituent is a halogen atom (-X).\n*   The other substituent must account for the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable functional group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond, satisfying all the given conditions.\n\n**3. Analyze the Expected 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nNow, we need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone. The two substituents (-X and -COCH3) can be arranged in three different ways on the ring: *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4). The NMR spectrum will reveal the substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Signal 1: The Acetyl Methyl Group (-COCH3)**\n    *   The three protons on this methyl group are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will not be split.\n    *   This will appear as a **singlet (s)**.\n    *   It will integrate to **3H**.\n    *   Its chemical shift is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm** because it's attached to a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: The Aromatic Protons (Ar-H)**\n    *   The pattern of these signals depends on the substitution pattern:\n        *   ***ortho* or *meta* substitution:** These isomers lack symmetry, resulting in four unique aromatic protons. This would produce a complex set of signals (multiplets), not simple patterns.\n        *   ***para* (1,4) substitution:** This isomer is highly symmetrical. There are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons next to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons next to the halogen are equivalent. This symmetry results in a very characteristic pattern: **two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's compare our prediction with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches our prediction for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This is a pair of doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons. This is the classic signature of a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum is a perfect match for a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks the key features. There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm), and there is no 3H singlet for the acetyl group. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a methyl ketone. An aldehyde group only has one carbon, which would mean the compound is a C7 species (e.g., p-halobenzaldehyde), contradicting the 8-carbon requirement. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). It cannot be the described aromatic compound. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 8-carbon aromatic ring with a carbonyl and a halogen is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
