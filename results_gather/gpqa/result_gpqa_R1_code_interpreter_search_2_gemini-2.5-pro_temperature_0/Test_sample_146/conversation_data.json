    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical process:** The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles, two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. The reaction is:\n    $p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   We have a proton and an antiproton.\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a key piece of information. It implies that the kinetic energy of the antiproton is negligible compared to its rest mass energy.\n    *   In such problems, we typically work in the center-of-mass frame. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, we can assume the proton is also effectively at rest or moving slowly to meet it, making the total initial momentum of the system approximately zero. Therefore, we can approximate the total initial energy ($E_i$) as the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial energy ($E_i$):**\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n    *   The antiproton has the same mass as the proton, so its rest mass energy ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is also 938.27 MeV.\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938.27 \\text{ MeV} + 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the final state:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   The mass of each particle A is given by $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    *   The total energy in the initial state is converted into the rest mass energy and kinetic energy of these four final particles.\n    *   Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero (Conservation of Momentum). By symmetry, the most probable outcome is that the available energy is shared equally among the four particles. This means they will all have the same total energy ($E_A$) and the same speed ($v$).\n\n5.  **Calculate the final energy ($E_f$):**\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Since there are four identical particles sharing the energy equally, the total final energy is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n    *   Substituting the given mass: $E_f = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n6.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n7.  **Solve for the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.56378$\n\n8.  **Solve for the velocity ($v$):**\n    *   Now we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find the velocity $v$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for $v/c$:\n        *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        *   $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        *   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n        *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.56378)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4454}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        *   $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\n9.  **Final Answer:**\n    *   The velocity of particle A is approximately $0.7688c$.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        A) 0.86c\n        B) 0.96c\n        C) 0.91c\n        D) 0.77c\n    *   The calculated value is closest to 0.77c.\n\nTo ensure precision, we can use a script for the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants from the problem\nmp_c2 = 938.27  # Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300    # Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# 1. Calculate total initial energy (assuming proton and antiproton are at rest)\nE_initial = 2 * mp_c2\n\n# 2. The final energy is E_final = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# By conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * mp_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n\n# 3. Solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma\ngamma = (2 * mp_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# 4. Solve for beta (v/c) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) => beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta_squared = 1 - (1 / (gamma**2))\nbeta = math.sqrt(beta_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\n> The calculated velocity of particle A is 0.77c\n\nThe calculation confirms that the velocity is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle:** The core principle governing this particle annihilation process is the conservation of energy. The total energy of the system before the annihilation must be equal to the total energy of the system after the annihilation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in physics problems, implying that the kinetic energy of the initial particles is negligible compared to their rest mass energy.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton is the same as an antiproton. From standard particle data, the rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   So, $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   We assume $A^+$ and $A^-$ have the same mass, $m_A$. The problem gives $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The initial momentum of the system is approximately zero (since the particles are moving slowly). By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero.\n    *   Due to symmetry, the most likely outcome is that the available energy is distributed equally among the four resulting particles. This means they will all have the same speed ($v$) and thus the same total relativistic energy ($E_A$).\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by the formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four particles: $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n    *   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n5.  **Solve for the velocity ($v$):**\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Substitute the known values:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find the velocity $v$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $v/c$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n6.  **Compare with options:**\n    *   The calculated value $0.77c$ matches option D.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nmp_c2 = 938.27\n\n# Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\nmA_c2 = 300\n\n# Total initial energy is the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton\nE_initial = 2 * mp_c2\n\n# Total final energy is 4 * gamma * mA_c2\n# By conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * mp_c2 = 4 * gamma * mA_c2\n\n# Solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma\ngamma = (2 * mp_c2) / (4 * mA_c2)\n\n# Solve for v/c (beta) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)  =>  beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\n# Print the result rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is approximately {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\n<<<D>>>",
