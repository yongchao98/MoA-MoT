    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on a described experiment.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the experimental setup and observations:**\n    *   **Antigen:** GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This targets the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n    *   **Location of response:** Fluorescent Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine, a key site for initiating immune responses to gut antigens. The fluorescence indicates the antigen has reached these sites and is being processed.\n    *   **Cells of interest:** Proliferating cell population isolated from the Peyer's patches. Proliferation (clonal expansion) is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response after antigen encounter.\n    *   **Key molecular finding:** Sequencing of the variable heavy chain (V-H) gene from these proliferating cells shows \"high variability.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the options in the context of the findings:**\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, involving a cascade of plasma proteins. It does not involve genetic changes in lymphocytes and is not responsible for variability in the variable heavy chain gene.\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process occurs in activated B cells, typically within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA or IgG), which alters the effector function of the antibody. However, it does *not* affect the *variable* region, which determines antigen specificity. The observation is high variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene, so CSR is not the primary process described.\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process also occurs in activated, proliferating B cells within germinal centers. SHM introduces point mutations at a very high rate specifically into the DNA sequences encoding the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different B cell receptors. Those with higher affinity for the antigen are then selected for survival and further proliferation (affinity maturation). This process is the direct cause of \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene among a population of B cells responding to a specific antigen. This perfectly matches the experimental observations: proliferating cells in a secondary lymphoid organ showing high variability in the V-H gene after antigen exposure.\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. It combines random V, D, and J gene segments. While it creates diversity, the process described in the question is happening *after* antigen encounter in a secondary lymphoid organ among a *proliferating* population. The \"high variability\" observed is the result of mutations being introduced into an already-formed V-D-J exon, not the initial formation of that exon.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating lymphocytes in a Peyer's patch following antigen stimulation is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
