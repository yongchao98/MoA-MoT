    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the limiting apparent magnitude for ESPRESSO on a single VLT.**\n\nThe problem states that a star is detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 is achieved in a 1-hour exposure. We need to find the faintest apparent magnitude (V) that satisfies this condition.\n\n1.  **Find the reference performance:** The ESPRESSO overview page states: \"ESPRESSO is designed to reach a S/N of 10 at magnitude V=20 in 1 hour of integration time with the 4-UT mode.\" The 4-UT mode combines the light from all four 8m VLT Unit Telescopes.\n\n2.  **Relate S/N, magnitude, and telescope area:**\n    *   The Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) is proportional to the square root of the number of photons collected.\n    *   The number of photons is proportional to the telescope's light-collecting area (A) and the flux (F) of the star.\n    *   The area (A) is proportional to the square of the telescope's diameter (D²).\n    *   The flux (F) is related to the apparent magnitude (m) by F ∝ 10⁻⁰.⁴ᵐ.\n    *   Therefore, for a fixed exposure time: S/N ∝ √A * √F ∝ D * 10⁻⁰.²ᵐ.\n\n3.  **Compare 4-UT mode and 1-UT mode:**\n    *   The 4-UT mode combines four 8m telescopes, which is equivalent in light-gathering power to a single telescope with a diameter D_4UT = √(4 * 8²) = 16m.\n    *   The question specifies using a single 8m telescope, so D_1UT = 8m.\n    *   We are given the performance for the 4-UT mode (let's call it Condition 2) and we want to find the limiting magnitude for the 1-UT mode (Condition 1).\n    *   Condition 2 (4-UT): S/N₂ = 10, D₂ = 16m, m₂ = 20.\n    *   Condition 1 (1-UT): S/N₁ = 10, D₁ = 8m, m₁ = ?\n\n4.  **Calculate the limiting magnitude (m₁):**\n    Since S/N ∝ D * 10⁻⁰.²ᵐ, we can set up a ratio:\n    S/N₁ / S/N₂ = (D₁ * 10⁻⁰.²ᵐ¹) / (D₂ * 10⁻⁰.²ᵐ²)\n    Since we want S/N₁ = S/N₂ = 10, the ratio is 1:\n    1 = (8m * 10⁻⁰.²ᵐ¹) / (16m * 10⁻⁰.²*²⁰)\n    1 = 0.5 * 10⁻⁰.²ᵐ¹ / 10⁻⁴\n    2 = 10⁻⁰.²ᵐ¹⁺⁴\n    Take the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n    log₁₀(2) = -0.2m₁ + 4\n    0.301 = -0.2m₁ + 4\n    0.2m₁ = 4 - 0.301\n    0.2m₁ = 3.699\n    m₁ = 3.699 / 0.2 = 18.495\n\n    So, a star is detectable with a single 8m VLT if its apparent magnitude V ≤ 18.5.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the visibility of each star from Paranal Observatory.**\n\n1.  **Find the observatory's location:** A quick search reveals the latitude of Paranal Observatory is approximately 24.6° South.\n2.  **Determine the visibility condition:** For a star to be observable, it must rise above the horizon. This means its declination (DEC) must be less than 90° - |latitude|.\n    Visibility limit: DEC < 90° - 24.6° = 65.4°. Any star with a declination greater than +65.4° will never be visible from Paranal.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate each star.**\n\nWe will now check each star for both visibility (DEC < +65.4°) and brightness (V ≤ 18.5). For stars c, d, e, and f, we first need to calculate their apparent magnitude (m_V) from their absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: m_V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d/10pc).\n\n*   **a) Canopus:**\n    *   Coordinates: DEC = -52.7°. This is < +65.4°, so it is **visible**.\n    *   Apparent Magnitude: V = -0.74. This is ≤ 18.5, so it is **bright enough**.\n    *   **Result: Detectable.**\n\n*   **b) Polaris:**\n    *   Coordinates: DEC = +89.3°. This is > +65.4°, so it is **not visible**.\n    *   **Result: Not Detectable.**\n\n*   **c) Star with M_V = 15, d = 10 pc:**\n    *   Coordinates: DEC = 0°. This is < +65.4°, so it is **visible**.\n    *   Apparent Magnitude: m_V = 15 + 5*log₁₀(10/10) = 15 + 0 = 15.0. This is ≤ 18.5, so it is **bright enough**.\n    *   **Result: Detectable.**\n\n*   **d) Star with M_V = 15, d = 200 pc:**\n    *   Coordinates: DEC = 0°. This is < +65.4°, so it is **visible**.\n    *   Apparent Magnitude: m_V = 15 + 5*log₁₀(200/10) = 15 + 5*log₁₀(20) ≈ 15 + 5*(1.301) = 21.5. This is > 18.5, so it is **not bright enough**.\n    *   **Result: Not Detectable.**\n\n*   **e) Star with M_V = 15, d = 5 pc:**\n    *   Coordinates: DEC = 0°. This is < +65.4°, so it is **visible**.\n    *   Apparent Magnitude: m_V = 15 + 5*log₁₀(5/10) = 15 + 5*log₁₀(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5*(-0.301) = 13.5. This is ≤ 18.5, so it is **bright enough**.\n    *   **Result: Detectable.**\n\n*   **f) Star with M_V = 15, d = 50 pc:**\n    *   Coordinates: DEC = 0°. This is < +65.4°, so it is **visible**.\n    *   Apparent Magnitude: m_V = 15 + 5*log₁₀(50/10) = 15 + 5*log₁₀(5) ≈ 15 + 5*(0.699) = 18.495. This is ≤ 18.5, so it is **bright enough**.\n    *   **Result: Detectable.**\n\n**Step 4: Count the detectable stars.**\n\nThe stars that are both visible from Paranal and bright enough to meet the S/N criterion are:\n1.  Canopus (a)\n2.  Star with d=10pc (c)\n3.  Star with d=5pc (e)\n4.  Star with d=50pc (f)\n\nThere are a total of 4 detectable stars.\n\n<<<A>>>"
