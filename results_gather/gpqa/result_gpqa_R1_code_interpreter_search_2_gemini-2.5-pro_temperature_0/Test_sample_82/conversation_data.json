    "This problem involves a two-step calculation for a titration process. First, we need to account for the initial dilution of the acetic acid. Second, we calculate the pH at two specific points in the titration curve: at 25% completion and at the equivalence point.\n\n**Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH):\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n*   The acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, so the new total volume is:\n    New Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   The new concentration of the diluted acetic acid is:\n    New Concentration (Ca) = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n**Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   At this point, 75% of the original acid (CH3COOH) remains, and 25% has been converted to the conjugate base (CH3COO⁻).\n*   The ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is [CH3COO⁻]/[CH3COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The solution now contains only the conjugate base, CH3COO⁻, which will hydrolyze in water.\n\n*   First, determine the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:\n    Moles of NaOH = Moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 mol\n    Volume of NaOH (Vb) = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) at this point:\n    [CH3COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C):\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Now, we can find the concentration of OH⁻ produced by this hydrolysis. Let [OH⁻] = x:\n    Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can simplify:\n    5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² = (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate the pOH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n*   Finally, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nLet's verify the calculations with a single script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- pH at 25% titration ---\n# The pH of a buffer is determined by the pKa and the ratio of base to acid.\n# At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3.\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- pH at equivalence point ---\n# 1. Moles of acid\nmoles_acid = 0.05 * 0.020  # 0.001 mol\n# 2.

Concentration of conjugate base [A-]\nconc_base_eq = moles_acid / total_vol_eq  # 0.001 / 0.050 = 0.02 M\n# 4. Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# 5.

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Initial Dilution**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    Moles = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **New total volume after dilution:**\n    New Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid:**\n    New Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution.\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   At this point, the ratio of the conjugate base to the remaining acid is:\n    [A⁻] / [HA] = 25% / (100% - 25%) = 25 / 75 = 1/3\n*   We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, and the solution contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n*   **Volume of NaOH needed:**\n    At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume of the solution:**\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate (CH₃COO⁻):**\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Initial moles of acid / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    The acetate ion reacts with water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Calculate Kb:**\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate. We can find it using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻]:**\n    We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02 M.\n    5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² = (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated pH values are 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
