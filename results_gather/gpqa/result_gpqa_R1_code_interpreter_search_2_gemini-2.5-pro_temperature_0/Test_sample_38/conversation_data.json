    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core principle:** The problem is about a quantum mechanical wave function, ψ(x). The fundamental principle we need to use is the normalization condition. This condition states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\n2.  **Define the Probability Density Function:** The probability of finding a particle at a specific position x is given by the probability density function, P(x). This function is calculated as the square of the modulus of the wave function, P(x) = |ψ(x)|².\n\n3.  **Calculate the Modulus of the Wave Function:** The given wave function is a complex number:\n    ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n    This is in the form `c + di`, where the real part is `c = a / sqrt(1 + x)` and the imaginary part is `d = -0.5`.\n    The modulus |ψ(x)| is calculated as `sqrt(c² + d²)`.\n    |ψ(x)| = sqrt( [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + [-0.5]² )\n    |ψ(x)| = sqrt( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 )\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability Density Function, P(x):**\n    P(x) = |ψ(x)|²\n    P(x) = ( sqrt( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) )²\n    P(x) = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n5.  **Apply the Normalization Condition:** The problem states that the particles are only found in the interval between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density function over this interval must be equal to 1.\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] P(x) dx = 1\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\n6.  **Solve the Integral:** We need to evaluate the definite integral.\n    ∫ ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = a² * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\n    The antiderivative is: a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x\n    Now, we evaluate this from x=1 to x=3:\n    [ a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 ] - [ a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 ]\n    = [ a² * ln(4) + 0.75 ] - [ a² * ln(2) + 0.25 ]\n    = a² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) + 0.75 - 0.25\n    = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\n    Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n    = a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n    = a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\n7.  **Solve for 'a':** Now we set the result of the integral equal to 1.\n    a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n    a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n    a = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** To get the final numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The value of 'a' is derived from the normalization condition: a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n# We use math.log for the natural logarithm (ln) and math.sqrt for the square root.\na = math.sqrt(0.5 / math.log(2))\n\nprint(a)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.8493263938426839\n</execute_code>\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 0.8493. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 0.6\n    B) 1.1\n    C) 0.35\n    D) 0.85\n\nThe value 0.8493 is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>",
