    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **The Chemical Reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[CaY]^{2-}$, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    *   Formation: $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    *   Dissociation: $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** We are given the formation constant, $K_f$ (also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which is $5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Setting up the Equilibrium Expression:** We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the dissociation of the complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions at equilibrium. Since the dissociation produces one $Ca^{2+}$ ion for every one $Y^{4-}$ ion, the concentration of $Y^{4-}$ will also be 'x'.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $Y^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Solving for x:** Now, we plug these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n5.  **Simplification:** Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the complex dissociates very little. Therefore, 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the approximation that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Calculation:** Now, we solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions.\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option B.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\nKf = 5e10  # Formation constant\n\n# The equilibrium expression is Kf = [CaY] / ([Ca][Y])\n# At equilibrium, [CaY] = initial_complex_conc - x\n# [Ca] = x\n# [Y] = x\n# So, Kf = (initial_complex_conc - x) / x^2\n# Since Kf is very large, x is very small, so we can approximate (initial_complex_conc - x) as initial_complex_conc.\n# Kf ≈ initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# x^2 ≈ initial_complex_conc / Kf\n# x = sqrt(initial_complex_conc / Kf)\n\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / Kf\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a solution that is prepared by dissolving 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Dissociation Equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as $[CaY]^{2-}$ (where $Y^{4-}$ is the fully deprotonated EDTA anion), dissociates slightly in solution according to the following equilibrium:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Formation Constant ($K_f$):** We are given the formation constant, $K_f$, for the complex. The formation reaction is the reverse of the dissociation reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    The equilibrium expression for formation is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **ICE Table:** We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n    *   **Initial:** The initial concentration of the complex $[CaY]^{2-}$ is 0.02 M. The initial concentrations of the dissociated ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$ and $[Y^{4-}]$, are 0.\n    *   **Change:** As the system reaches equilibrium, the concentration of the complex decreases by 'x', while the concentrations of the ions each increase by 'x'.\n    *   **Equilibrium:** The equilibrium concentrations are $[CaY]^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$, $[Ca^{2+}] = x$, and $[Y^{4-}] = x$.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $Y^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Solving the Equilibrium Expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n5.  **Approximation:** The value of $K_f$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), which indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying approximation that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n6.  **Calculation:** The expression simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.
