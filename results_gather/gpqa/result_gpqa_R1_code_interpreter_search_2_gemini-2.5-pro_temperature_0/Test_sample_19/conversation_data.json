    "This question asks us to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is to treat a scattering event off a nucleus as a sum of scattering events off its individual constituent nucleons, where each of these nucleons behaves as if it were free. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the foundational assumption of the impulse approximation. It posits that the probe (e.g., an electron or a neutrino) interacts with a single nucleon at a time. This neglects more complex interactions, such as meson-exchange currents, where the probe interacts with the virtual particles exchanged between nucleons. Therefore, this assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption deals with what happens *before* and *after* the primary interaction. It implies that the incoming probe and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) do not interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons in the nucleus. This is known as neglecting \"final-state interactions\" (FSI) for the outgoing particles and initial-state interactions for the incoming probe. In its simplest form, called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), this assumption is crucial. While more advanced models (like the Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation, DWIA) try to correct for this, the basic impulse approximation relies on this idea of transparency.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation treats the nucleon as a fundamental entity for the purpose of the interaction. It takes the properties of the nucleon (like its form factors) from experiments on *free* nucleons. These experimentally determined properties already encapsulate all the complex internal dynamics of the nucleon, including the relativistic motion of its constituent quarks and gluons. The impulse approximation itself does not make a separate assumption about the internal quark dynamics; it simply uses the observed free-nucleon properties. Therefore, this assumption is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the \"impulse\" part of the approximation. It assumes that the interaction happens over a very short timescale, so the momentum transferred to the nucleon is very large. During this brief \"impulse,\" the relatively slow-acting binding forces from the other nucleons are considered negligible. The nucleon is effectively \"knocked out\" of the nucleus as if it were a free particle at the moment of interaction. This is a central tenet of the approximation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe impulse approximation is defined by the assumptions that the interaction targets a single nucleon (1), that this nucleon is not affected by its binding potential during the brief interaction (4), and that the particles involved do not re-interact with the rest of the nucleus (2). Assumption (3) is about the internal structure of the nucleon, which is taken as a given from free-nucleon experiments, not an assumption of the approximation itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
