    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data to identify the products and their quantities.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect and absorb acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the identity of gas C and verify the law of conservation of mass.**\n\nThe total mass of the initial salt mixture was 7.20 g. This must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of gas C:\n*   Molar mass of C = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nThe elements present in the products are H (from H₂O), O (from H₂O and O₂), and the elements from gas C. Since no CO₂ was formed, there is no carbon. A gas with a molar mass of ~28 g/mol that is inert under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂), with a molar mass of 2 * 14.007 = 28.014 g/mol. This is a perfect match.\n\nSo, the gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n\n**3. Determine the overall stoichiometry of the decomposition.**\n\nWe have the molar amounts of all products:\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.025 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol\n\nTo find the simplest whole-number ratio, we divide all values by the smallest value (0.025):\n*   N₂ : 0.10 / 0.025 = 4\n*   O₂ : 0.025 / 0.025 = 1\n*   H₂O : 0.20 / 0.025 = 8\n\nThe overall stoichiometric ratio of the products is 4N₂ : 1O₂ : 8H₂O.\n\n**4. Identify salts A and B.**\n\nThe original salts A and B decomposed to produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O. This means they must be composed of Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Hydrogen. Since they are salts, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions. The most common candidates are:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nLet's examine their decomposition reactions:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)  *(Note: This decomposition occurs at higher temperatures, consistent with the production of O₂)*\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of A and B. Let's assume we have `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produces: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produces: `n` moles of N₂, `n/2` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `n/2`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nThe molar ratio of the products from this mixture is (2n) : (n/2) : (4n). Multiplying by 2 to clear the fraction gives 4 : 1 : 8. This perfectly matches the ratio we derived from the experimental data. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**5. Calculate the number of atoms.**\n\nNow we can find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (e.g., Ammonium Nitrate): NH₄NO₃**\n    *   Number of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₃⁻) = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen (O) atoms = 3\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (e.g., Ammonium Nitrite): NH₄NO₂**\n    *   Number of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₂⁻) = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen (O) atoms = 2\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n*   Total atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nTo be certain, we can quickly verify the initial mass using the value of `n`. From the product data, we know that 0.025 moles of O₂ were produced.\n*   Moles of O₂ = `n/2` = 0.025 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   So, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Mass(NH₄NO₃) = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.002 g\n*   Mass(NH₄NO₂) = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g\n*   Total mass = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given 7.20 g.\n\nThe reasoning is consistent and all data points are satisfied.\n\n<<<A>>>"
