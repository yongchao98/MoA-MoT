    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integration (Total Number of Protons):**\n    The sum of the integrations for all signals is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons. Let's check the number of protons in the possible compounds:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2):** Has 5 carbons, 8 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens. The number of protons is 8. This is a possible match.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2):** Has 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens. The number of protons is 10. This does not match the data.\n\n    Based on the total number of protons, we can eliminate Cis-butenyl acetate (B) and Trans-butenyl acetate (C). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Individual Signals:**\n    Let's analyze the structure of propenyl acetate: `CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3`. We need to assign the four signals to the four distinct groups of protons in this structure.\n\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet with an integration of 3H in this chemical shift range is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (C=O). This is the acetate methyl group (`-O-C(=O)-CH3`). It is a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon.\n\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet with an integration of 3H. This corresponds to the methyl group on the propenyl chain (`CH3-CH=`). It is a doublet because its protons are split by the single proton on the adjacent carbon of the double bond.\n\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These two signals correspond to the two protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (the vinylic protons).\n        *   The signal at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq). It is split into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (`CH3-CH=`) and into a doublet by the other vinylic proton.\n        *   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d). It is split only by the other vinylic proton. Its chemical shift is further downfield because it is attached to the carbon bearing the electronegative oxygen atom (`=CH-O-`).\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    The key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons.\n    *   For **trans** isomers, the coupling constant (`J_trans`) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   For **cis** isomers, the coupling constant (`J_cis`) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\n    The data shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz** for the signal at 7.0 ppm. This value falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The total proton count indicates a propenyl acetate. The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons confirms a trans geometry for the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
