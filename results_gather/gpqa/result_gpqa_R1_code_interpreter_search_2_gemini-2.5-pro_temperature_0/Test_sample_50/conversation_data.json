    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n\nWhen the charge `q` is brought near the sphere, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. These induced charges redistribute themselves in such a way that the net potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. Calculating the potential energy directly from this surface charge distribution (`sigma`) is complicated.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nA powerful technique to solve this type of problem is the \"method of images.\" We can replace the grounded sphere and its complex induced surface charge with a single, imaginary point charge (an \"image charge\") inside the sphere. This setup must replicate the boundary condition, which is V = 0 on the surface of the sphere.\n\nLet's find the magnitude and position of this image charge, which we'll call `q'`.\n\n*   **Position of Image Charge (`b`):** The image charge `q'` must lie on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the external charge `q`. Let its distance from the center be `b`.\n*   **Magnitude of Image Charge (`q'`):** For the potential to be zero everywhere on the sphere's surface (at radius `R`), the image charge and its position are found to be:\n    *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\nNow, the system of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` perfectly reproduces the electric field *outside* the sphere. The potential on the surface of the sphere due to these two charges is zero, satisfying the boundary condition.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As we bring `q` closer, it moves in the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere. The potential created by these induced charges at the location of `q` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe force on the charge `q` is the electrostatic force between `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n*   The force is `F = k * q * q' / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`.\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to `d`, which is the integral of the force.\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\nThis integration is possible but can be complex.\n\n**Method B: Using Potential (Simpler)**\n\nA more direct formula for the interaction energy `U` between a charge `q` and a grounded conductor is:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nWhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. As established, this is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n1.  **Calculate `V_induced` at the position of `q`:**\n    The potential at distance `d` from the center (the location of `q`) due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   distance = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n\n    Substituting these in:\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Potential Energy `U`:**\n    Now, we use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*(Note: The factor of 1/2 is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution is not independent; its existence and magnitude depend on the presence of `q`. We are calculating the energy to build the entire system, not just placing a charge in a pre-existing field.)*\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated potential energy is `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nComparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   B) `U = -k * q^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   C) `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n*   D) `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur result matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
