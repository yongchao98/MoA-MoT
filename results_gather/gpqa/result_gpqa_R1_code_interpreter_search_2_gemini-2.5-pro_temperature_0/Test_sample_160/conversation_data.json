    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM).\n    *   **Condition 1:** An ultra-high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr) exists in the sample compartment. There are still some residual gas molecules.\n    *   **Measurement 1 (λ1):** The mean free path of the *gas molecules themselves* is measured as λ1. This path is determined by collisions between gas molecules.\n    *   **Condition 2:** An electron beam (1000 kV) is turned on. The temperature and gas concentration remain the same.\n    *   **Measurement 2 (λ2):** A new mean free path, λ2, is observed. This path is based on the *scattering of electrons* by the gas molecules.\n    *   **Question:** What is the relationship between λ1 and λ2?\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The general concept of mean free path is the average distance a particle travels before it collides with another particle.\n    *   The formula for MFP is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the particles being collided with).\n        *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" that one particle presents to another for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the Physics to λ1:**\n    *   **Traveling Particle:** A gas molecule.\n    *   **Target Particle:** Another gas molecule.\n    *   **Number Density (n):** The density of gas molecules in the chamber. Let's call it `n_gas`.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (σ1):** This is the cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule. This is essentially a \"billiard ball\" type collision, governed by the physical size of the molecules. The standard formula from kinetic theory is σ1 = √2 * π * d², where `d` is the diameter of the gas molecule. The √2 factor accounts for the relative motion of the molecules.\n    *   **Formula for λ1:** λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ1) = 1 / (n_gas * √2 * π * d²)\n\n4.  **Apply the Physics to λ2:**\n    *   **Traveling Particle:** An electron from the beam.\n    *   **Target Particle:** A gas molecule.\n    *   **Number Density (n):** The density of the target particles is still the density of gas molecules, `n_gas`. This value has not changed.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (σ2):** This is the cross-section for an *electron scattering* off a gas molecule. This is a fundamentally different interaction. The electron is a charged particle. The gas molecule, while electrically neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a negatively charged electron cloud. The incoming electron interacts with this charge distribution via the long-range Coulomb force. An electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\") even if it passes quite far from the center of the gas molecule. This makes the effective target area for scattering much larger than the physical, geometric area of the molecule.\n    *   **Formula for λ2:** λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ2)\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   We have λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ1)\n    *   We have λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ2)\n    *   The number density `n_gas` is the same in both equations.\n    *   The key is to compare the cross-sections, σ1 and σ2.\n    *   σ1 is the kinetic cross-section for molecule-molecule collisions (related to physical size).\n    *   σ2 is the scattering cross-section for electron-molecule interactions (related to the long-range Coulomb force).\n    *   Because the Coulomb interaction has a much longer range than the forces governing molecule-molecule collisions (van der Waals forces), the effective target area for an electron is much larger.\n    *   Therefore, **σ2 > σ1**.\n\n6.  **Draw the Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the cross-section (σ), and σ2 is larger than σ1, it must be that λ2 is smaller than λ1.\n    *   λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    *   If σ2 > σ1, then 1/σ2 < 1/σ1.\n    *   Multiplying by 1/n_gas (a positive constant) doesn't change the inequality: 1/(n_gas * σ2) < 1/(n_gas * σ1).\n    *   This means **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n7.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1  (Incorrect)\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect)\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1 (Correct)\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect)\n\nThe reasoning is solid and leads directly to option C. No external search or calculation is needed as the question is based on fundamental physics principles.\n\n<<<C>>>"
