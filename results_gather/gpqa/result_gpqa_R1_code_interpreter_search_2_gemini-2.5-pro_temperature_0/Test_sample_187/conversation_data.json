    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the interplanar distance for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n### 1. Understand the Given Information\n- Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n- Lattice parameter (interatomic distance), `a`: 10 Angstrom\n- Interaxial angle, `α`: `α = β = γ = 30°`\n- Miller indices of the plane, `(hkl)`: (111)\n\n### 2. Recall the Formula for Interplanar Spacing\nFor a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` is given by:\n\n1/d_hkl² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²(α) - cos(α)) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²(α) + 2cos³(α)) ]\n\nwhere:\n- `d_hkl` is the interplanar distance for the plane (hkl)\n- `a` is the lattice parameter\n- `α` is the interaxial angle\n- `h, k, l` are the Miller indices\n\n### 3. Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane\nFor the (111) plane, we have `h = 1`, `k = 1`, and `l = 1`. Let's substitute these values into the formula:\n- `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n- `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nNow, substitute these into the numerator of the formula:\nNumerator = `3sin²(α) + 2(3)(cos²(α) - cos(α))`\nNumerator = `3sin²(α) + 6cos²(α) - 6cos(α)`\nUsing the identity `sin²(α) = 1 - cos²(α)`:\nNumerator = `3(1 - cos²(α)) + 6cos²(α) - 6cos(α)`\nNumerator = `3 - 3cos²(α) + 6cos²(α) - 6cos(α)`\nNumerator = `3 + 3cos²(α) - 6cos(α)`\nNumerator = `3(1 - 2cos(α) + cos²(α))`\nNumerator = `3(1 - cos(α))²`\n\nNow, let's simplify the denominator term `(1 - 3cos²(α) + 2cos³(α))`. This can be factored as:\nDenominator term = `(1 - cos(α))²(1 + 2cos(α))`\n\nSo, the full expression for `1/d_111²` becomes:\n1/d_111² = [ 3(1 - cos(α))² ] / [ a²(1 - cos(α))²(1 + 2cos(α)) ]\n\nWe can cancel the `(1 - cos(α))²` term from the numerator and the denominator:\n1/d_111² = 3 / [ a²(1 + 2cos(α)) ]\n\nThis is the simplified formula for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Value\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n- `a = 10` Angstrom\n- `α = 30°`\n- `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\nd_111² = [ a²(1 + 2cos(α)) ] / 3\nd_111² = [ 10²(1 + 2(√3 / 2)) ] / 3\nd_111² = [ 100(1 + √3) ] / 3\n\nNow, we take the square root to find `d_111`:\nd_111 = √[ 100(1 + √3) / 3 ]\nd_111 = 10 * √[ (1 + √3) / 3 ]\n\nTo get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0\n\n# Convert angle to radians for Python's math functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Calculate cos(alpha)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n\n# Simplified formula for d_111\n# d_111 = a * sqrt((1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3)\nd_111 = a * math.sqrt((1 + 2 * cos_alpha) / 3)\n\nprint(d_111)\n```\n>>>\n9.542955921528803\n>>>\nThe calculation gives a value of approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe calculated interplanar distance for the (111) plane is `d_111 ≈ 9.54` Angstrom. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 8.95 Angstrom\nB) 9.08 Angstrom\nC) 10.05 Angstrom\nD) 9.54 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
