    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are the presence of a chiral center or axial/planar/helical chirality. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls have a single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Rotation around this single bond can be restricted if there are large, bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   In this compound, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   The steric hindrance from these groups prevents the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar and restricts free rotation around the central C-C bond. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   Because of this restricted rotation, the molecule is locked into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral, and its mirror image is non-superimposable. It exists as a pair of enantiomers and thus exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is called a chiral center or a stereocenter.\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (R- and S-forms).\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   The structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2C=O. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The molecule does not contain any chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. It has a C2 rotational axis passing through the C=O bond. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   A molecule that is superimposable on its mirror image is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds 1 (due to atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nThus, the correct option includes only compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
