    "This problem requires us to calculate the total relativistic energy of a specific nucleus moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties:**\n*   The nucleus is specified as \"Li with 3 neutrons\".\n*   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it always has 3 protons.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li).\n*   To calculate its energy, we first need its rest mass ($m_0$). We can find this by taking the atomic mass of Lithium-6 and subtracting the mass of its 3 electrons.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Mass Energy ($E_0$):**\n*   The rest mass energy is given by Einstein's famous equation, $E_0 = m_0c^2$.\n*   We will use precise values for the masses and conversion factors.\n    *   Atomic mass of $^{6}$Li: 6.0151228 amu\n    *   Mass of an electron: 0.00054858 amu\n    *   Mass of the $^{6}$Li nucleus ($m_0$) = (Atomic mass of $^{6}$Li) - (3 * mass of an electron)\n    *   $m_0$ = 6.0151228 - 3 * 0.00054858 = 6.01347706 amu\n*   Now, we convert this mass from atomic mass units (amu) to energy in Mega-electron Volts (MeV) using the conversion factor 1 amu = 931.494 MeV/c².\n    *   $E_0$ = 6.01347706 amu * 931.494 MeV/amu = 5601.51 MeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relativistic Factor (Lorentz Factor, γ):**\n*   The particle is moving at a speed (v) of 0.96c, where c is the speed of light.\n*   The Lorentz factor, γ, accounts for relativistic effects at high speeds and is calculated as:\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √0.0784\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714\n\n**4.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties**\n\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus as \"Li with 3 neutrons\".\n*   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it contains 3 protons.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons. A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus in question is Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li).\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Mass and Rest Energy ($E_0$) of the Nucleus**\n\nTo find the total relativistic energy, we first need the rest energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$), where $m_0$ is the rest mass of the nucleus.\n\n*   We start with the atomic mass of a neutral $^{6}$Li atom and subtract the mass of its 3 electrons to find the mass of the nucleus.\n*   Using precise physical constants:\n    *   Atomic mass of $^{6}$Li: 6.0151228 amu\n    *   Mass of an electron: 0.00054858 amu\n*   Calculate the mass of the $^{6}$Li nucleus ($m_0$):\n    $m_0$ = (Atomic mass of $^{6}$Li) - (3 × mass of an electron)\n    $m_0$ = 6.0151228 amu - (3 × 0.00054858 amu) = 6.01347706 amu\n*   Now, we convert this rest mass into rest energy (in MeV) using the mass-energy equivalence factor: 1 amu = 931.494 MeV/c².\n    $E_0 = m_0c^2$ = 6.01347706 amu × 931.494 MeV/amu = 5601.51 MeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor accounts for relativistic effects at high speeds. It is determined by the nucleus's speed, v = 0.96c.\n\n*   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   Substituting v = 0.96c:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    γ = 1 / √0.0784\n    γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714\n\n**4.

Convert the Energy to Giga-electron Volts (GeV)**\n\nThe options are given in GeV, so we convert our result from MeV to GeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n\n*   E ≈ 20005.4 MeV / 1000 = 20.0054 GeV.\n\n**6.
