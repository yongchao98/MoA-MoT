    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a C2 rotational axis and a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the double bond.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                   C=C\n                 H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Reaction with mCPBA.** This is an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom is a *syn*-addition, meaning it adds to the same face of the double bond. When a trans-alkene undergoes syn-addition, it forms a trans-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the attack of mCPBA can occur from the top or bottom face with equal probability, leading to a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n    *   Attack from one face gives (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack from the other face gives (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   These two products are enantiomers. So, the intermediate is a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction with aqueous acid (H3O+).** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons. This attack occurs with inversion of configuration (*anti*-addition relative to the original double bond).\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The molecule is symmetric, so attack at C4 or C5 is equally likely.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) leads to inversion, making it S. The configuration at C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is R) leads to inversion, making it S. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol is a *meso* compound, as it has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   If we start with the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, the same logic applies, and the product is also the same meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                   C=C\n                 H       H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Reaction with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a cis-alkene forms a cis-epoxide.\n    *   The resulting cis-4,5-epoxyoctane has two chiral centers (C4 and C5) but also has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is a *meso* compound.\n    *   The intermediate is a single achiral product: meso-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction with aqueous acid (H3O+).** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the meso-epoxide proceeds via *anti*-attack by water.\n    *   Let's consider the meso-epoxide (e.g., (4R,5S)-epoxide).\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) leads to inversion, making it S. The configuration at C5 remains S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) leads to inversion, making it R. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers.\n    *   Since the starting material (meso-epoxide) and reagents are achiral, the two enantiomeric products must be formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated on a standard column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Since all three stereoisomers in the mixture are different, they will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The meso compound (a diastereomer to the others) will have a unique retention time.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), will be separated from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
