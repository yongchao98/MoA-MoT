    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to RV Amplitude (K):** The magnitude of the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift, given in the problem, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the RV semi-amplitude, or simply amplitude, $K$.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ mÅ}}{5 \\text{ mÅ}} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV amplitude $K$ is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship for this Specific Problem:** The problem states that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$.\n    *   In RV measurements, the quantity that can be determined is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin i$. The problem states the planets have similar masses, which in this context implies that the measured values of $m_p \\sin i$ are the same for both planets. So, we assume $m_{p1} \\sin i_1 = m_{p2} \\sin i_2$.\n    *   The term $(M_{star} + m_p)$ is also the same for both systems since both components are the same.\n\n    With these conditions, all terms in the formula for $K$ are constant for both systems except for the orbital period $P$. The relationship simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:** From the proportionality $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write a ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n    Now, substitute the known values:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:** To find the numerical answer, we calculate the value of $(5/7)^3$.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\nratio_K1_over_K2 = 5 / 7\nperiod_ratio_P2_over_P1 = ratio_K1_over_K2 ** 3\nprint(period_ratio_P2_over_P1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644324960753532\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Connection between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift of the host star's spectral lines. The amount of wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$). The maximum periodic shift, which is given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Ratio of RV Amplitudes:** Since the RV amplitude $K$ is proportional to the maximum wavelength shift $\\Delta \\lambda$, the ratio of the amplitudes for the two stars is the same as the ratio of their wavelength shifts.\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ mÅ}}{5 \\text{ mÅ}} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Use the Formula for RV Amplitude:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude $K$ is given by the equation:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    (This is a common approximation where the planet's mass $m_p$ is negligible compared to the star's mass $M_{star}$).\n    Here:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula Based on the Problem's Conditions:** The problem states that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n    *   In the context of the RV method, the quantity measured is the \"minimum mass,\" $m_p \\sin i$. The statement that the planets have similar masses implies that the measured values of $m_p \\sin i$ are the same for both systems.\n    *   $G$ and $2\\pi$ are constants.\n\n    Given these conditions, all terms in the equation for $K$ are the same for both systems except for the orbital period $P$. This leads to the proportionality:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:** We can express the proportionality as a ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We need to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n    $\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    Therefore:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Substitute the Known Values and Compute:** We know that $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n    Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    $\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 \\approx (0.7143)^3 \\approx 0.3644$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
