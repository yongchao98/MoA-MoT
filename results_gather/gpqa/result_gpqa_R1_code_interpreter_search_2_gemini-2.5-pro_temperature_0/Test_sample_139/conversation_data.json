    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance B:**\n    *   The problem states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is the well-known melting point of heavy water, or deuterium oxide (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   The initial clue mentions that Substance X incorporates a \"heavier isotope,\" which strongly supports the presence of deuterium (D), the heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Gas W:**\n    *   The problem states that gas W is released in a reaction and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   Let's examine some simple gas molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen): Each ¹⁴N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   CO (Carbon Monoxide): ¹²C has 6p, 6n. ¹⁶O has 8p, 8n. The molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n    *   Given that we've already identified D₂O in the problem, the most logical candidate for gas W is **D₂**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n    *   **Clue 1:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope.\" This fits with a deuterated compound.\n    *   **Clue 2:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. A reduction reaction is required to lower the oxygen count to 2 (by converting both the ketone and carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). This means **X is a strong reducing agent**.\n    *   **Clue 3:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common pair of reagents where one is the deuterated version of the other. The most famous strong reducing agent pairs are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Clue 4:** X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W (D₂) and form precipitate G. Let's test the hypothesis that **X is LiAlD₄**.\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent, fitting Clue 2.\n        *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent, fitting Clue 3.\n        *   It contains deuterium, fitting Clue 1.\n        *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with a deuterium source like heavy water (Y = D₂O) would be violent and produce D₂ gas. The reaction is:\n            LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)\n        *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W), which matches our deduction.\n        *   It also produces Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate, matching the description of G.\n    *   **Clue 5:** \"precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"\n        *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) causes decomposition:\n            2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B)\n        *   This reaction releases D₂O (B), which perfectly matches our first deduction.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The formula for Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   We identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic number (Z):\n        *   Hydrogen (Z=1) -> **Lightest element**\n        *   Lithium (Z=3)\n        *   Aluminum (Z=13) -> **Heaviest element**\n    *   The question specifies to sum the masses of *all* instances of these elements in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved:\n        *   The isotope of the lightest element (Hydrogen) is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**.\n        *   The isotope of the heaviest element (Aluminum) is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**.\n    *   Now, we calculate the cumulative mass:\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (H): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Al): There is 1 atom of Aluminum. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
