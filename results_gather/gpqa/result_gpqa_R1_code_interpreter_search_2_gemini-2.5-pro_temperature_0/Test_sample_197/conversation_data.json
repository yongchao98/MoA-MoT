    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], we need to calculate its fraction relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**1. Identify the species and equilibria:**\nThe cobalt(II) ions (Co^2+) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN-) to form a series of complexes:\n- [Co(SCN)]+\n- [Co(SCN)2] (the blue complex)\n- [Co(SCN)3]-\n- [Co(SCN)4]2-\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (βn):\n- Co^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]+ ; β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9\n- Co^2+ + 2 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2] ; β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40\n- Co^2+ + 3 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]- ; β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63\n- Co^2+ + 4 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]2- ; β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16\n\n**2. Define the total cobalt concentration:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co^2+ ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]\n\n**3. Express complex concentrations in terms of [Co^2+]:**\nUsing the stability constant expressions, we can write the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co^2+], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN-]:\n- [[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]\n- [[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2\n- [[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3\n- [[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for c(Co):\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)\n\n**4. Calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex:**\nThe fraction of a specific species, in this case [Co(SCN)2], is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. This fraction is often denoted as α2.\nα2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstitute the expressions from the previous steps:\nα2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))\n\nThe [Co^2+] term cancels out, leaving:\nα2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)\n\n**5. Plug in the given values and solve:**\n- [SCN-] = 0.1 M\n- β1 = 9\n- β2 = 40\n- β3 = 63\n- β4 = 16\n\nThe total cobalt concentration (10^-2 M) is much lower than the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M), so we can assume the equilibrium concentration of [SCN-] is approximately its initial concentration, 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can perform the calculation using a Python script for accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Given concentration of thiocyanate\nSCN_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator of the fraction formula\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * SCN_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * SCN_conc**2\nterm3 = beta3 * SCN_conc**3\nterm4 = beta4 * SCN_conc**4\n\n# The numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)2])\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms, representing the total cobalt species relative to free Co(II)\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n>>>\n16.91618032648228\n<<<\n\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 16.9%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**1. Define the Species and Equilibria**\nThe cobalt(II) ions, Co²⁺, react with thiocyanate ions, SCN⁻, to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**2. Use Stability Constants**\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (βn):\n- `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n- `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n- `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n- `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**3. Formulate the Fraction of the Desired Complex**\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, which we can call α₂, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from step 2 into the equation for `c(Co)`, we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, we can write the expression for α₂:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation to:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Substitute Values and Calculate**\nWe are given:\n- `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M (We can assume this concentration remains constant because it is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration of 10⁻² M).\n- `β₁` = 9\n- `β₂` = 40\n- `β₃` = 63\n- `β₄` = 16\n\nLet's calculate the terms:\n- Numerator: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n- Denominator terms:\n    - `1`\n    - `β₁ * [SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    - `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    - `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    - `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n- Total Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches the output from the code execution (`16.916...`).\n\nComparing our result to the options:\nA) 16.9%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated percentage is 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
