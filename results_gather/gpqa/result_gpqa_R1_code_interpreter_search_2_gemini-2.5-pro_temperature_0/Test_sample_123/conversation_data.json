    "This problem involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and radioactive decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the core physics principles:**\n    *   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles, N, that have not decayed after a time 't' in their own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds. From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), their internal clocks run slower. The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (`t_lab_lifetime`) is dilated by the Lorentz factor, `γ`: `t_lab_lifetime = γ * τ`.\n    *   **Survival Condition:** A particle \"reaches the detector\" if it survives for the time it takes to travel from the center to the inner wall.\n\n2.  **Formulate the equations for the fraction of surviving particles:**\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to travel the radius `R` of the detector in the lab frame is `t_travel = R / v`.\n    *   Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light, `c`. So, we can approximate `t_travel ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The fraction of particles that survive is `f = N(t_travel) / N₀`. We need to express the decay in terms of lab frame quantities. The decay law can be written as `N(t_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / t_lab_lifetime)`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `t_travel` and `t_lab_lifetime`, we get:\n        `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n        `f = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Analyze the two scenarios given in the problem:**\n    *   Let `C = R / (c * τ)` be a constant that depends on the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime. The formula simplifies to `f = exp(-C / γ)`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Fraction of survivors, `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Plugging these into the formula: `1/3 = exp(-C / 20)`\n        *   To solve for `C`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n            `ln(1/3) = -C / 20`\n            `-ln(3) = -C / 20`\n            `C = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Fraction of survivors, `f₂ = 2/3`\n        *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n        *   Plugging these into the formula: `2/3 = exp(-C / γ₂)`\n        *   Again, take the natural logarithm:\n            `ln(2/3) = -C / γ₂`\n            `-ln(3/2) = -C / γ₂`\n            `ln(3/2) = C / γ₂`\n            `γ₂ = C / ln(3/2)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the unknown Lorentz factor, `γ₂`:**\n    *   Now we substitute the expression for `C` that we found in Scenario 1 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   We can use the property of logarithms `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n5.  **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    *   To get a precise value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of gamma_2\n# gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / (math.log(3) - math.log(2))\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe output of this calculation is approximately 54.185.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 54\n    *   B) 68\n    *   C) 40\n    *   D) 28\n    The calculated value of ~54.2 is closest to option A.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe reasoning shows that to increase the fraction of surviving particles from one-third to two-thirds, the Lorentz factor must be increased. The required Lorentz factor is calculated to be approximately 54.2.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem describes a classic scenario involving special relativity and particle decay. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` in the particle's own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their time appears to run slower from the perspective of the laboratory (the detector). The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (`t_lab_lifetime`) is dilated by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `t_lab_lifetime = γ * τ`\n\n*   **Survival Fraction:** A particle \"reaches the detector\" if it survives for the time it takes to travel the radius `R` of the detector. The time of flight in the lab frame (`t_travel`) is:\n    `t_travel = R / v`\n    Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `t_travel ≈ R / c`.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive (`f`) is the ratio `N / N₀` after the time `t_travel`. Using the decay law in the lab frame:\n`f = N(t_travel) / N₀ = exp(-t_travel / t_lab_lifetime)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_travel` and `t_lab_lifetime`, we get the key formula:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n\nLet's group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ` into a single constant `K = R / (cτ)`, since these values do not change between the two scenarios. The formula simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### **2. Apply the Formula to Both Scenarios**\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of survivors, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into our formula:\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTo solve for the constant `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of survivors, `f₂ = 2/3`\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n`γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n### **3. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for `K` we found in Scenario 1 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\nUsing the property of logarithms `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / (1.0986 - 0.6931)`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
