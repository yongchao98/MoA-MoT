    "This is a problem of special relativity. We need to calculate two quantities: the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.\n\n**1. Calculation of the relative speed (v_rel)**\n\nThe formula for the relativistic velocity subtraction (since both astronauts are moving in the same direction) is given by:\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, v1 = 0.6c\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, v2 = 0.5c\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7\nv_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.\n\n**2. Calculation of the total energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula:\nE = γ * m_0 * c^2\nwhere γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2) and m_0 is the rest mass.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\n**For the first astronaut:**\n*   Rest mass, m1 = 2m\n*   Velocity, v1 = 0.6c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor γ1:\nγ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)\nγ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nγ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)\nγ1 = 1 / 0.8\nγ1 = 1.25\n\nNow, calculate the energy E1:\nE1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2\nE1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2\nE1 = 2.5 mc^2\n\n**For the second astronaut:**\n*   Rest mass, m2 = 3m\n*   Velocity, v2 = 0.5c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor γ2:\nγ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)\nγ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)\nγ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)\nγ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866\nγ2 ≈ 1.1547\n\nNow, calculate the energy E2:\nE2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2\nE2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2\nE2 ≈ 3.4641 mc^2\n\n**Total Energy:**\nE_total = E1 + E2\nE_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2\nE_total = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2\nE_total = 5.9641 mc^2\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated relative speed is v_rel ≈ 0.14c and the total energy is E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
