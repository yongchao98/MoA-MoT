    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the most effective mutation:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by a specific gene. To stop the compound's synthesis, we need to disrupt the gene so that it no longer produces a functional protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Gene:** The intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`, which is the universal start codon (Methionine). It ends with `...TGA-3’`, which is one of the three stop codons. The protein synthesis starts at `ATG` and continues until a stop codon is reached.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Types of Mutations:**\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. This *might* disrupt protein function, especially if the change occurs in a critical region, but it could also have little to no effect.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a premature stop codon. This truncates the protein, and if it occurs early in the sequence, it almost always results in a non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation (Insertion/Deletion):** The insertion or deletion of nucleotides (not in a multiple of three). This shifts the reading frame, changing every subsequent amino acid. This typically leads to a completely different and non-functional protein, often encountering a premature stop codon in the new frame.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Mutant Sequence:** We will break down each DNA sequence into three-letter codons and translate them into amino acids to see the effect of the mutation. The genetic code will be used for translation (`_` represents a stop codon).\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...`\n        *   This is our baseline for a functional protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Thr ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes a single amino acid. This might not be enough to completely inactivate the protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - STOP`\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA` (a stop codon). This is a **nonsense mutation**. Translation will stop after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This peptide will almost certainly be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val). These are two **missense mutations**. While two changes are more disruptive than one, it is still not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Thr - Ser ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence also contains two changes: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `GGT` (Gly) -> `ACT` (Thr). These are two **missense mutations**. Again, this is not as certain to eliminate function as a premature stop codon.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most effective way to ensure a gene is knocked out is to prevent the synthesis of a full-length protein. Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is the most drastic and definitive change among the options, making it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
