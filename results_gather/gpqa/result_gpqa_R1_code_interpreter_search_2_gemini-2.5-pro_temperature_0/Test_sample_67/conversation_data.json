    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle is in a magnetic field `B_z = B * z_hat`. Its magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with this field. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ . B_z = -γ * S_z * B`. Since the moment is aligned, the particle is in the lowest energy state, which is the spin-up eigenstate of `S_z`. We denote this state as `|+z>`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this state vector is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n*   **Final State (t > 0):** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to `B_y = B * y_hat`. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ . B_y = -γ * S_y * B`.\n\n### 2. Time Evolution of the System\n\nThe state of the particle for `t > 0` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian `H_new`. The time-evolved state `|ψ(t)>` is given by:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / hbar) |ψ(t=0)>`\nSubstituting the expressions for `H_new` and `|ψ(t=0)>`:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γ * B * S_y) * t / hbar) |+z>`\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / hbar) |+z>`\n\nThis expression describes a rotation of the initial state `|+z>` around the Y-axis by an angle `θ(t) = γ * B * t`. This physical phenomenon is known as **Larmor precession**. The spin vector, initially pointing along the +Z axis, will precess around the new magnetic field axis (+Y).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\nWe need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <γ * S_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t)`.\nThe expectation value of `S_z` at time `t` is:\n`<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n\nWe can solve this in a few ways.\n\n#### Method 1: Schrödinger Picture (Direct Calculation)\n\n1.  **Express the initial state in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian.**\n    The new Hamiltonian is proportional to `S_y`. The Pauli matrix for `S_y` is `S_y = (hbar/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    The initial state `|+z> = [[1], [0]]` can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of `S_y` (`|+y>` and `|-y>`).\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * |+y> - (i/√2) * |-y>`\n\n2.  **Evolve the state in time.**\n    The eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>` have energies `E_+ = -γB(hbar/2)` and `E_- = +γB(hbar/2)` under `H_new`.\n    The time evolution is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * exp(-iE_+t/hbar) * |+y> - (i/√2) * exp(-iE_-t/hbar) * |-y>`\n    Let `ω = γB`. Then `E_+ = -ω*hbar/2` and `E_- = +ω*hbar/2`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * exp(iωt/2) * |+y> - (i/√2) * exp(-iωt/2) * |-y>`\n\n3.  **Convert back to the Z-basis and calculate `<S_z>`**.\n    After substituting the Z-basis representations of `|+y>` and `|-y>` and simplifying (using Euler's formulas), we find the state vector at time `t` is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n\n4.  Now, calculate the expectation value:\n    `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n    `<S_z>(t) = (hbar/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we get:\n    `<S_z>(t) = (hbar/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Find the oscillation frequency.**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (hbar/2) * cos(ωt)`\n    The oscillation is described by the `cos(ωt)` term. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    Since we defined `ω = γB`, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Heisenberg Picture\n\nThe Heisenberg equation of motion for an operator `A` is `dA/dt = (1/(i*hbar)) * [A, H]`.\nFor `A = S_z` and `H = -γBS_y`:\n`dS_z/dt = (1/(i*hbar)) * [S_z, -γBS_y] = (-γB/(i*hbar)) * [S_z, S_y]`\nUsing the commutation relation `[S_z, S_y] = -i*hbar*S_x`:\n`dS_z/dt = (-γB/(i*hbar)) * (-i*hbar*S_x) = +γB*S_x`\n\nSimilarly, for `A = S_x`:\n`dS_x/dt = (1/(i*hbar)) * [S_x, -γBS_y] = (-γB/(i*hbar)) * [S_x, S_y]`\nUsing the commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = i*hbar*S_z`:\n`dS_x/dt = (-γB/(i*hbar)) * (i*hbar*S_z) = -γB*S_z`\n\nWe have a system of coupled differential equations:\n1.  `dS_z/dt = γB * S_x`\n2.  `dS_x/dt = -γB * S_z`\n\nDifferentiating the first equation and substituting the second gives:\n`d²S_z/dt² = γB * (dS_x/dt) = γB * (-γB * S_z) = -(γB)² * S_z`\n`d²S_z/dt² + (γB)² * S_z = 0`\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\n#### Method 3: Energy Splitting\n\nThe initial state `|+z>` is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates (`|+y>` and `|-y>`) of the new Hamiltonian. The energies are `E_+ = -γB(hbar/2)` and `E_- = +γB(hbar/2)`.\nThe interference between these two energy components in the superposition causes observables (that are not diagonal in the energy basis) to oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is given by the energy difference:\n`ω = ΔE / hbar = (E_- - E_+) / hbar`\n`ω = ( (γB*hbar/2) - (-γB*hbar/2) ) / hbar`\n`ω = (γB*hbar) / hbar = γB`\n\nAll three methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
