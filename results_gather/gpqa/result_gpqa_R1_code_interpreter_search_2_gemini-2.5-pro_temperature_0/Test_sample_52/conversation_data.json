    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aromatic Ring Information:**\n    *   The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens with two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons is a strong indication of para (1,4) substitution. This high degree of symmetry makes pairs of protons chemically equivalent, simplifying the spectrum to two signals (typically two doublets). This C6H4 fragment accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Group Information:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows the presence of an **ester group**. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms. This accounts for the O2 part of all the proposed chemical formulas.\n    *   The ester group also contains a carbonyl (C=O) bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Signals for the Substituents:**\n    *   **Vinyl Protons:** There are \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H\". This means there is a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) with a hydrogen attached to each carbon. The signals are described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\".\n        *   A **doublet** means a proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   A **doublet of quartets (dq)** means a proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet splitting) and a set of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet splitting).\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n            *   Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a), so its signal would be a doublet.\n            *   Proton H(a) is coupled to H(b) (giving a doublet) and the three H(c) protons (giving a quartet). Its signal would be a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description. So, one of the substituents on the ring is a propenyl group. This group has the formula -C3H5 and accounts for the two vinyl-H signals and one of the -CH3 signals.\n\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\".\n        *   We have already identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl substituent.\n        *   The second -CH3 group must be part of the other substituent, which we know is an ester.\n\n    *   **Absence of -CH2 Groups:** The spectrum has \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\". This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates possibilities like ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) or longer alkyl chains.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Pieces and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a **para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4)**.\n    *   One substituent is a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**, which has a formula of C3H5.\n    *   The other substituent is an ester that contains a methyl group. The only way to form this without a -CH2- group is to have a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-OOCCH3)**. Both of these fragments have the formula C2H3O2.\n    *   Let's combine these fragments to build the whole molecule. A plausible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n    *   Now, let's sum the atoms to find the total chemical formula:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 2 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **11 Carbons**\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **12 Hydrogens**\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   For C11H12O2, DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Our proposed structure has:\n        *   1 aromatic ring (4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds)\n        *   1 C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n        *   1 C=O double bond in the ester group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n    *   Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. The calculated DBE matches the structure, confirming its validity.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The deduced formula C11H12O2 matches option C. The other formulas are inconsistent with the spectroscopic data. For instance, C11H14O2 would have a DBE of 5, and C12 formulas would require an additional carbon atom, which cannot be accommodated without violating the NMR data constraints (e.g., by adding a CH2 group).\n\n<<<C>>>"
