    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means it's a cascade process involving an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an E1 transition to occur, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition:** From $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l' = 1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule: $n' < 3$.\n        *   The lowest possible energy level with $l=1$ is $n=2$. So, the most probable first transition is to the $n'=2$ level. The options provided in the question confirm that the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** From the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if this transition is allowed by the selection rules.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m'$ values (i.e., for $m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n        *   $\\Delta n = n_{final} - n' = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\n4.  **Identify Possible Transition Routes:** Based on the analysis above, there are three possible cascade routes from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) for each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The branching ratio is the ratio of the rate of a specific transition to the total transition rate.\n    The transition rate $\\Gamma_{i \\to f}$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    Let's analyze the rate of the first transition: $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the three degenerate sub-levels $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equally probable.\n\n    To formally verify this, we can use the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition rate from $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle l, m; 1, q | l', m' \\rangle|^2$, where $q = m' - m$.\n    For the first transition: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and $|f\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    So, $l=0, m=0$ and $l'=1, m'=m'$. This gives $q = m' - 0 = m'$.\n    The relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is $\\langle 0, 0; 1, m' | 1, m' \\rangle$. For coupling anything with angular momentum 0, this coefficient is always 1.\n    So, $|\\langle 0, 0; 1, m' | 1, m' \\rangle|^2 = 1$ for all three possible values of $m' (-1, 0, 1)$.\n\n    This confirms that the transition rates are equal:\n    $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,-1) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,1)$.\n\n    The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. Since the only allowed E1 decay is to the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the total rate is:\n    $\\Gamma_{total} = \\sum_{m'=-1,0,1} \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$.\n    Let $\\Gamma_0 = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$ for any $m'$. Then $\\Gamma_{total} = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\n    The probability, or branching ratio, for the transition to proceed via a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n    $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0)}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Since the rates are equal for all three intermediate $m'$ states, the probability for each of the three routes is $1/3$.\n\n6.  **Consider the Second Transition's Probability:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, it must decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Are there other competing decay channels from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$?\n    According to the selection rules, a state with $l=1$ can decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$.\n    *   $l=0$: The only state with $l=0$ and $n<2$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $l=2$: States with $l=2$ (d-states) only exist for $n \\ge 3$. Since decay requires $n_{final} < n_{initial}$, there are no allowed E1 transitions from $n=2, l=1$ to an $l=2$ state.\n    Therefore, the state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ can only decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an E1 transition. The probability of this second step, given the atom is in the intermediate state, is 1.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The overall probability of a specific cascade route is the probability of the first step (the branching ratio) multiplied by the probability of the second step.\n    Probability = (Branching Ratio of first step) $\\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n    So, for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability is $1/3$.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    A) Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, probability is $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    B) Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability, should be $1/3$)\n    C) Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability, should be $1/3$)\n    D) Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Correct route and probability)\n\n<<<D>>>"
