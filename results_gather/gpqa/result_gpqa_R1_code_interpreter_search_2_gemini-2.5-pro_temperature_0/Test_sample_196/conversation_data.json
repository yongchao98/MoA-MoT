    "*   **Analysis of Compound X from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption between `3400–2500 cm-1` is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong absorption at `1720 cm-1` is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at `1610 cm-1` and `1450 cm-1` are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: This very downfield, broad singlet corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield because it is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is more upfield, indicating it's adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   So far, the structure is an alkyl-substituted benzoic acid, specifically `4-alkylbenzoic acid`.\n        *   Now, let's determine the structure of the alkyl group from the remaining signals:\n            *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂). This suggests an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH).\n            *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet integrating to 2H corresponds to the -CH₂- group of the ethyl fragment. It's a multiplet because it's split by both the adjacent -CH₃ and the -CH group.\n            *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet integrating to 1H corresponds to the -CH group. This proton is attached directly to the benzene ring and is split by the protons of both methyl groups and the methylene group.\n        *   Assembling the alkyl group: We have a -CH group bonded to a -CH₃ group and a -CH₂CH₃ group. This is a `sec-butyl` group: `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`.\n        *   Conclusion from NMR: Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    2.  **Reaction Type:** Red P and HI form a powerful reducing system. This combination is known to reduce a variety of functional groups to alkanes. Most relevant here is its ability to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    3.  **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material (Compound X): 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   The sec-butyl group at position 4 and the benzene ring will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n        *   Final Product: The resulting molecule will have a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in a para (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring. The name of this compound is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Matching with Options**\n\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X, not the final product.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - Correct. This matches the predicted product of the reduction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
