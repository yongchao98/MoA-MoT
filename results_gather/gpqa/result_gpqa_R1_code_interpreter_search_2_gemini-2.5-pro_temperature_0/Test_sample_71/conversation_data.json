    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative, let's call it **N-OtBu**). This will act as the dienophile.\n    *   5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n    *   Sodium iodide (NaI).\n    *   Elevated temperature.\n\n*   **In-situ generation of the diene:** The reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide is a known method for generating a highly reactive diene via reductive elimination of the four bromine atoms. The two `CHBr2` groups on adjacent carbons (C5 and C6) will be converted into two exocyclic double bonds (`=CH2`). The product is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene** (let's call it diene **D**).\n\n    The structure of diene **D** is:\n    ```\n          C4(H)=C3(H)\n         /       \\\n        C5(=CH2)   C2(H)\n        |          ||\n        C6(=CH2)---C1(H)\n    ```\n    This molecule **D** will act as the diene in the subsequent reaction. The diene system for the Diels-Alder reaction is the one composed of the two exocyclic double bonds (`CH2=C5-C6=CH2`), which are held in a favorable conformation for cycloaddition.\n\n*   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** The problem states that 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used for every one equivalent of **N-OtBu**. **N-OtBu** has two double bonds, so it will undergo two successive Diels-Alder reactions, one at each double bond.\n\n    **N-OtBu** + 2 **D** → **Product 1**\n\n    Product 1 is a large, symmetric molecule formed by the addition of two molecules of **D** to the norbornadiene core.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Transformation:** These are standard acidic hydrolysis conditions for cleaving a tert-butyl ether. The 7-(tert-butoxy) group (-OtBu) is converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\n    **Product 1** (-OtBu) → **Product 2** (-OH)\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Transformation:** This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing alcohols. The secondary alcohol at the C7 position is oxidized to a ketone (C=O).\n\n    **Product 2** (-OH) → **Product 3** (=O)\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Transformation:** Product 3 is a ketone derivative of a double Diels-Alder adduct. Diels-Alder reactions are often reversible at high temperatures. This process is called a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   The heating of Product 3 will reverse the two Diels-Alder reactions that formed it. This will regenerate two molecules of the diene **D** and one molecule of the original dienophile core, which is now **7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene** (also known as norbornadien-7-one).\n\n    **Product 3** → 2 **D** + norbornadien-7-one\n\n*   **Decomposition:** Norbornadien-7-one is a known unstable molecule. It readily undergoes a cheletropic reaction to extrude carbon monoxide (CO), driven by the formation of the very stable aromatic benzene ring.\n\n    norbornadien-7-one → **Benzene** + **CO**\n\n*   **Identifying Product 4:** The final reaction mixture contains benzene, carbon monoxide, and two molecules of the diene **D**. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the \"final product 4\". Benzene has only 1 type of hydrogen (not an option), and CO has none. Therefore, \"product 4\" must refer to the other stable organic product, the diene **D**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Diene D)**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. It is an isomer of styrene with the formula C₈H₈.\n*   **Symmetry:** While one might initially assume the molecule is planar, computational studies and molecular models show that to relieve steric strain, the molecule adopts a non-planar, twisted conformation. This stable conformation possesses a **C₂ axis of symmetry**.\n*   **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** The molecule has a total of 8 hydrogen atoms:\n    *   4 hydrogens on the cyclohexadiene ring (at C1, C2, C3, C4).\n    *   4 hydrogens on the two methylidene (=CH₂) groups.\n\n    A C₂ axis of symmetry means that the molecule is superimposable on itself after a 180° rotation about the axis. This symmetry operation pairs up the atoms. For the 8 hydrogen atoms, they will be grouped into 4 equivalent pairs.\n    *   H on C1 is equivalent to H on the corresponding carbon on the other side.\n    *   H on C2 is equivalent to H on the corresponding carbon on the other side.\n    *   The two \"inner\" hydrogens on the =CH₂ groups are equivalent to each other.\n    *   The two \"outer\" hydrogens on the =CH₂ groups are equivalent to each other.\n\n    Therefore, there are **4** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Each set contains two equivalent hydrogens. This would result in 4 signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4 is 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
