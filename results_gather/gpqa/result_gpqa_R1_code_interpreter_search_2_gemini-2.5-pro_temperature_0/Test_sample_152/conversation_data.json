    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the acidic α-hydrogen located between the two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Mechanism (1,4-Conjugate Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons of the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π-electrons of the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    *   The reaction mixture contains ethanol (EtOH), which acts as a proton source to protonate the enolate intermediate at the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:**\n    *   The attack forms a new C-C bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n4.  **Naming the Product (A):**\n    *   To name this molecule as a tricarboxylate, we can identify a three-carbon propane backbone.\n    *   Let's number the chain as `(MeOOC)CH₂ - CH(p-tolyl) - CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   The propane backbone is `C3-C2-C1`.\n    *   C1 has two methoxycarbonyl groups (`-COOCH₃`).\n    *   C2 has the p-tolyl group.\n    *   C3 has one methoxycarbonyl group.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (the β-carbon of the original ketone), which is C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The structure is `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This is a Michael-type addition.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a new enolate (at the nitrile).\n    *   The intermediate is protonated (by MeOH).\n    *   The final step is acidic workup (H₃O⁺), which hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Product Formation:**\n    *   The reaction adds a `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group to the α-carbon of the original cyclohexanone.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the 2-position.\n    *   The structure is `2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n4.  **Naming the Product (B):**\n    *   The main functional group is the nitrile, so it is named as a derivative of butanenitrile: `NC-CH₂-CH(substituent)-CH₃`.\n    *   The substituent at position 3 is the 2-oxocyclohexyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major and most stable product, rather than its enol tautomer.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Knowns (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK). Structure: `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Reagents:** KOH, H₂O. KOH is the base that creates the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Michael Donor (Reactant C):**\n    *   A Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophilic carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Let's break the product at the bond formed during the reaction. The product has a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety and a `-(CH₂)₂-CO-CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) moiety.\n    *   The 3-oxobutyl group came from the Michael acceptor, MVK, after it accepted the nucleophile and a proton.\n    *   The new bond is between C2 of the dione ring and the former β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   This means the nucleophile was the enolate of the dione, formed by deprotonation at the highly acidic C2 position (between the two carbonyls).\n    *   Therefore, the starting Michael donor (reactant C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing this with the given options, option B matches all three results.\n\n<<<B>>>"
