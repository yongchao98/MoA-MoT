    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Vector Field**\n\nThe problem describes a vector field `f(r)` with the following properties:\n*   **Magnitude**: The magnitude of the field at a distance `r` from the origin is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`.\n*   **Direction**: The field points radially outward from the origin.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, we can express this vector field as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. Identify the Goal**\n\nThe goal is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∇.f`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\nThe integral to be calculated is:\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV`\n\n**3. Choose the Right Tool: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nCalculating the divergence `∇.f` directly can be tricky. The field `f(r)` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where its magnitude becomes infinite. While the divergence is zero for `r ≠ 0`, at `r=0` it is a Dirac delta function.\n\nA much more straightforward method is to use the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface that encloses the volume.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `V` is the volume (the sphere of radius R).\n*   `S` is the closed surface that bounds the volume (the surface of the sphere of radius R).\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outward from the surface.\n\n**4. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\nWe will now calculate the surface integral `∮_S (f . dS)`.\n\n*   **The Surface (S)**: The surface is a sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n\n*   **The Vector Field on the Surface (f)**: We evaluate the field `f(r)` at `r=R`:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n*   **The Differential Surface Element (dS)**: For a sphere, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is given by `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`. The vector `dS` points in the normal (radially outward) direction, so:\n    `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`\n\n*   **The Dot Product (f . dS)**: Now, we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f . dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] . [ (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    The terms `1/R^2` and `R^2` cancel out. The dot product of the unit vector `r_hat` with itself is `r_hat . r_hat = 1`.\n    `f . dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * (r_hat . r_hat) * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n    `f . dS = 1 * 1 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n    `f . dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n\n*   **The Surface Integral**: Finally, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = ( ∫_φ=0^(2π) dφ ) * ( ∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ )`\n\n    Let's evaluate each part:\n    *   `∫_φ=0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    *   `∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Multiplying the results:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`\n\nThe result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R>0` and the sphere encloses the origin).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 0\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
