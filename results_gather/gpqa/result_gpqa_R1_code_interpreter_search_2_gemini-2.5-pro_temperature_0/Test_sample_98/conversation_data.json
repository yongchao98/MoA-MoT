    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe most discriminating information comes from the proton NMR spectrum, specifically the complex splitting patterns.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four candidate structures are saturated, consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nWe need to find the structure that has protons which would give rise to *both* of these specific splitting patterns. Let's analyze the splitting for a proton (H) based on its neighbors using the n+1 rule:\n*   **Doublet (d):** 1 neighboring proton (n=1).\n*   **Triplet (t):** 2 equivalent neighboring protons (n=2).\n*   **Quartet (q):** 3 equivalent neighboring protons (n=3).\n\nTherefore:\n*   A **dtq** arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one proton (d), a set of two equivalent protons (t), and a set of three equivalent protons (q).\n*   A **dtt** arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one proton (d), a set of two equivalent protons (t), and a second, different set of two equivalent protons (t).\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each candidate molecule. The most likely protons to exhibit such complex splitting are the ones on the chiral centers (the `C(H)` groups).\n\n#### **Candidate A: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\nThis is 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid: `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   **H at C3:** Is coupled to H at C4 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ at C2 (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, gives a quartet). This proton's signal would be a **dtq**.\n*   **H at C4:** Is coupled to H at C3 (1H, gives a doublet) and the two CH₃ groups on C4 (6H, gives a septet). This signal would be a doublet of septets.\n*   **Result:** This molecule has a `dtq` but does not have a `dtt`. It is not the correct compound.\n\n#### **Candidate B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\nThis is 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n*   **H at C3:** Is coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This signal is a **dtq**.\n*   **H at C2:** Is coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₃ on C2 (3H, quartet). This signal is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   **Result:** This molecule has a `dtq` but does not have a `dtt`. It is not the correct compound.\n\n#### **Candidate C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\nThis is 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n*   **H at C3:** Is coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H, triplet). This signal is a **dtt**.\n*   **H at C2:** Is coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C2 (2H, triplet). This signal is a doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   **Result:** This molecule has a `dtt` but does not have a `dtq`. It is not the correct compound.\n\n#### **Candidate D: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\nLet's analyze the two protons on the chiral centers (C3 and C4).\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H on C4 (1 neighbor) → **doublet**\n    *   The CH₂ group at C2 (2 neighbors) → **triplet**\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 neighbors) → **triplet**\n    *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n*   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H on C3 (1 neighbor) → **doublet**\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2 neighbors) → **triplet**\n    *   The terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3 neighbors) → **quartet**\n    *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other required signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nStructure D is the only candidate that would produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (from the proton at C3) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (from the proton at C4) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
