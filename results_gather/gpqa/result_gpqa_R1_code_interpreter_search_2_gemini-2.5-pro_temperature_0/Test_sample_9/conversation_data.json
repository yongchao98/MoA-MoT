    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four described exoplanets has the highest density.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct Each Option:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is a baseline planet, essentially a clone of Earth. The density of Earth is a standard value, approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's denote this as ρ_E.\n        *   Density (a) = ρ_E ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given directly in the problem description.\n        *   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to, but slightly less than, Earth's density.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This is a \"Super-Earth\". The key here is understanding the effect of mass on a planet's structure.\n        *   **Composition:** It's made of the same \"stuff\" as Earth (iron, nickel, silicates, etc.).\n        *   **Mass:** It is 5 times more massive.\n        *   **Physics Principle:** Increased mass leads to stronger self-gravity. This immense gravitational force compresses the materials (the iron core, the silicate mantle) much more than they are compressed inside Earth.\n        *   **Effect on Density:** Density is mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). While the mass is 5 times greater, the increased compression means the volume will be *less* than 5 times Earth's volume. The atoms are packed more tightly together. Therefore, the overall density will be significantly higher than Earth's density.\n        *   Density (c) > ρ_E.\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This is a \"sub-Earth\". The logic is the reverse of option (c).\n        *   **Composition:** Same as Earth.\n        *   **Mass:** It is half the mass of Earth.\n        *   **Physics Principle:** Less mass means weaker self-gravity. The materials will be less compressed than they are inside Earth.\n        *   **Effect on Density:** With less compression, the same amount of material takes up more space. The overall density will be lower than Earth's density.\n        *   Density (d) < ρ_E.\n\n3.  **Compare the Densities:**\n    *   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n    *   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the derived relative densities, it is clear that planet (c) has the highest density. The gravitational compression due to its large mass is the deciding factor.\n\n5.  **Final Check (Optional Quantification):**\n    *   For rocky planets, there's an approximate mass-radius relationship: R ∝ M^β, where β is about 0.27-0.3. Let's use β ≈ 0.27.\n    *   Density ρ = M/V ∝ M/R³.\n    *   So, ρ ∝ M / (M^0.27)³ = M / M^0.81 = M^0.19.\n    *   This means density increases with mass (since the exponent 0.19 is positive).\n    *   For planet (c), M = 5 M_E. So, ρ_c ∝ (5 M_E)^0.19 ≈ 1.35 * ρ_E. This would be roughly 1.35 * 5.51 ≈ 7.4 g/cm³.\n    *   For planet (d), M = 0.5 M_E. So, ρ_d ∝ (0.5 M_E)^0.19 ≈ 0.88 * ρ_E. This would be roughly 0.88 * 5.51 ≈ 4.8 g/cm³.\n    *   The quantitative check confirms the qualitative reasoning: c > a > b > d.\n\n6.  **Select the Final Answer:** The highest density belongs to option (c).\n\n<<<C>>>"
