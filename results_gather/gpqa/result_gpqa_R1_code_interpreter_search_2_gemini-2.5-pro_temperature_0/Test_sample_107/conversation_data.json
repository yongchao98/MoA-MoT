    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Quantities to Compare**\n\nWe need to compare two energy values:\n1.  **The paramagnetic coupling term, `<H>`**: This is the energy shift of an atomic level due to an external magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the Zeeman effect.\n2.  **The transition energy, `ΔE`**: This is the energy difference between two electronic levels in the Hydrogen atom, corresponding to the emission or absorption of a photon with a given wavelength.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Term (`<H>`)**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field `B` is given by:\n`H = - \\vec{\\mu_L} \\cdot \\vec{B}`\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment `\\vec{\\mu_L}` is related to the orbital angular momentum `\\vec{L}` by:\n`\\vec{\\mu_L} = - \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L}`\nwhere `e` is the elementary charge and `m_e` is the electron mass.\n\nThis can be expressed using the Bohr magneton, `\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}`:\n`\\vec{\\mu_L} = - \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L}`\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian:\n`H = \\left( - \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L} \\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} (\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B})`\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field `\\vec{B}` is parallel to the Oz axis, so `\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}`. The dot product becomes:\n`\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B`\n\nSo, the Hamiltonian is:\n`H = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} L_z B`\n\nThe energy shift, which is the expectation value `<H>`, is found by replacing the operator `L_z` with its eigenvalue, `m\\hbar`, where `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n`\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} (m\\hbar) B = m \\mu_B B`\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of this energy.\n*   **B**: The magnetic field strength is given as `B = 1 T`.\n*   **m**: The problem states `m` has small values. For an order-of-magnitude comparison, we can take `m=1`.\n*   **μ_B**: The Bohr magneton is a physical constant. Its value is approximately `\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}`.\n\nLet's calculate `<H>`:\n`\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T})`\n`\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}`\n\n### **3. Calculate the Transition Energy (`ΔE`)**\n\nThe transition energy `ΔE` is the energy of a photon with the given wavelength `λ`. The relationship is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n`\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}`\n\nWe are given:\n*   **λ**: The wavelength is `\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu m = 486.1 \\text{ nm}`.\n*   **hc**: The product of Planck's constant and the speed of light is a useful constant in physics, with a value of approximately `hc \\approx 1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}`.\n\nNow, let's calculate `ΔE`:\n`\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}`\n\n(Note: This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series transition from n=4 to n=2 in the Hydrogen atom, which is a transition in the visible part of the spectrum).\n\n### **4. Compare the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energy values:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: `\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}`\n*   Transition energy: `\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}`\n\nTo compare them, we can look at their ratio:\n`\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.55 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}`\n\nThis ratio is a very small number, on the order of `10^{-5}`. This means that the paramagnetic coupling energy is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n`\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E`\n\nThis result is expected. The Zeeman splitting (paramagnetic coupling) represents a very fine perturbation to the main energy levels of an atom, while the transition energy `ΔE` corresponds to the large energy difference between these main levels.\n\nTo be certain, let's use a python script to perform the calculation with higher precision constants.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# Constants\n# Bohr magneton in eV/T\nmu_B_in_J_per_T = const.value('Bohr magneton')\neV_in_J = const.value('electron volt')\nmu_B = mu_B_in_J_per_T / eV_in_J\n\n# hc product in eV*m\nh = const.value('Planck constant in eV s')\nc = const.c\nhc = h * c\n\n# Given values\nB = 1.0  # Magnetic field in Tesla\nm = 1    # A small integer for the magnetic quantum number\nlambda_val = 0.4861e-6  # Wavelength in meters\n\n# 1. Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy <H>\nE_para = m * mu_B * B\n\n# 2. Calculate the transition energy Delta_E\nDelta_E = hc / lambda_val\n\n# 3. Compare the two energies\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> = {E_para:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta_E = {Delta_E:.4f} eV\")\nprint(f\"Ratio <H> / Delta_E = {E_para / Delta_E:.4e}\")\n\n# Conclusion based on the ratio\nif E_para / Delta_E < 0.01:\n    print(\"Conclusion: <H> << Delta_E\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The relationship is different.\")\n```\nParamagnetic coupling energy <H> = 5.7884e-05 eV\nTransition energy Delta_E = 2.5508 eV\nRatio <H> / Delta_E = 2.2692e-05\nConclusion: <H> << Delta_E\n\nThe calculation confirms that the paramagnetic coupling energy is significantly smaller than the transition energy.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to compare the order of magnitude of two distinct energy values related to a Hydrogen atom:\n*   **The paramagnetic coupling term `⟨H⟩`**: This is the energy shift of an atomic state due to an external magnetic field `B`. This is also known as the Zeeman effect energy.\n*   **The transition energy `ΔE`**: This is the energy of a photon involved in an electronic transition within the atom, given by its wavelength `λ`.\n\n### **2. Calculating the Paramagnetic Coupling Term `⟨H⟩`**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment of an electron with an external magnetic field `B` is given by:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment `\\vec{\\mu}_L` is related to the orbital angular momentum `\\vec{L}` by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} = -\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L}$\nwhere `\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}` is the Bohr magneton, a fundamental physical constant.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian expression:\n$H = \\left(-\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}(\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B})$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field is parallel to the Oz axis, so `\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}`. The dot product simplifies to:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\nThus, the Hamiltonian operator is:\n$H = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} L_z B$\n\nThe energy shift, `⟨H⟩`, is the expectation value of this Hamiltonian. For a state with a defined orbital magnetic quantum number `m`, the eigenvalue of the `L_z` operator is `m\\hbar`. Therefore:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} (m\\hbar) B = m \\mu_B B$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `B = 1` T (a typical strong laboratory magnetic field)\n*   `m` is a small integer. For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can take `m=1`.\n*   The Bohr magneton, `\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5}` eV/T.\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\n### **3. Calculating the Transition Energy `ΔE`**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength `λ` by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = hf = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWe are given the wavelength:\n*   `\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu m = 486.1` nm\n\nA useful constant for this calculation is the product `hc`, which is approximately `1240` eV·nm.\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\n(Note: This wavelength corresponds to the blue-green line in the Hydrogen spectrum, specifically the Balmer series transition from the `n=4` to the `n=2` energy level.)\n\n### **4. Comparing the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n*   Electronic transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.55 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.3 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThe ratio is a very small number, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of a typical visible light transition.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the two quantities is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis makes physical sense: the Zeeman effect causes a very small splitting of the main electronic energy levels. The energy of this splitting is much smaller than the energy difference between the levels themselves.\n\n<<<B>>>"
