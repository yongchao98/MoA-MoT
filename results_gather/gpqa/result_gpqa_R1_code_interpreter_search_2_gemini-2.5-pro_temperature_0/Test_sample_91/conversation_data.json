    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to calculate the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) for the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe can calculate the enthalpy of formation using bond energies with the following formula:\nΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\nFirst, let's determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms from the condensed formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2C: 1 (chain) + 2 (methyl) = 3\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   CH2: 1\n    *   CH(CH3): 1 (chain) + 1 (methyl) = 2\n    *   CH2: 1\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   C(CH3)2: 1 (chain) + 2 (methyl) = 3\n    *   **Total C atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   CH2: 2\n    *   CH(CH3): 1 (chain) + 3 (methyl) = 4\n    *   CH2: 2\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   (CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   **Total H atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22**\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C as solid graphite, H as H2 gas) into gaseous atoms.\n\n*   **For Carbon:** We need 12 moles of gaseous carbon atoms.\n    *   Energy = 12 mol × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n\n*   **For Hydrogen:** We need 22 moles of gaseous hydrogen atoms, which come from 11 moles of H2 molecules. The energy required to break the H-H bonds in 11 moles of H2 is:\n    *   Energy = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants:**\n    *   Σ ΔH_atomization(reactants) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**4. Count the Bonds in the Product Molecule (C12H22)**\nWe need to count the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated in the formula: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -C**H=C**(CH3)2. So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We can find the number of C-C single bonds by counting them in the structure:\n    *   Two C-C bonds in the initial (CH3)2C group.\n    *   One C-C bond between CH and CH2.\n    *   One C-C bond between CH2 and CH(CH3).\n    *   One C-C bond for the methyl branch in CH(CH3).\n    *   One C-C bond between CH(CH3) and the next CH2.\n    *   One C-C bond between CH2 and CH.\n    *   Two C-C bonds in the final C(CH3)2 group.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms combine to form one mole of the product.\n\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 × BE(C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 × BE(C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 × BE(C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n\n*   **Total Bond Energy of Product:**\n    *   Σ BE(product) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\nNow, we apply the main formula:\n\n*   ΔH_f = [Σ ΔH_atomization(reactants)] - [Σ BE(product)]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**7. Convert to the Required Units**\nThe options include answers in kJ/g. We need to convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass of C12H22.\n\n*   Molar Mass (M) of C12H22 = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get 11.45 kJ/g. This matches option D.\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\nenthalpy_atomization_carbon = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_h_h = 100             # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_c_c = 200             # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_c_double_c = 300      # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_c_h = 400             # kJ/mol\n\n# Counts for the molecule C12H22\nnum_c_atoms = 12\nnum_h_atoms = 22\nnum_c_c_bonds = 9\nnum_c_double_c_bonds = 2\nnum_c_h_bonds = 22\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n\n# 1.

    "The problem asks for the calculation of the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms in the molecule.\n- Structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n- Carbon atoms: 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (in CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 (in C(CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n- Hydrogen atoms: 6 (in (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (in CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (in C(CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n- The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Write the Formation Reaction**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the reactants into gaseous atoms (12 C(g) and 22 H(g)).\n- Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n- Energy to break 11 moles of H2 bonds: 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n- **Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms form one mole of the product, C12H22. We need to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.\n- **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n- **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n- **C-C bonds:** The total number of bonds in a non-cyclic molecule is (Number of C atoms) + (Number of H atoms) - 1 = 12 + 22 - 1 = 33 bonds. The number of C-C single bonds is the total number of bonds minus the C-H and C=C bonds.\n  Number of C-C bonds = 33 - 22 (C-H) - 2 (C=C) = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nNow, calculate the total bond energy:\n- Energy from C-H bonds = 22 × BE(C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n- Energy from C-C bonds = 9 × BE(C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n- Energy from C=C bonds = 2 × BE(C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n- **Total bond energy of the product** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when forming the product.\n- ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)\n- ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options include an answer in kJ/g. We need to convert our result using the molar mass of C12H22.\n- Molar Mass (M) of C12H22 = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n- ΔH_f (in kJ/g) = (ΔH_f in kJ/mol) / (Molar Mass in g/mol)\n- ΔH_f (in kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
