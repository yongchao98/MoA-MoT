    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the initial state after dilution.**\n*   The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   It is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The new total volume is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration of the acid.\n    *   M₁ = 0.05 M\n    *   V₁ = 20.00 cm³\n    *   V₂ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   M₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n*   So, we are titrating a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by the reaction with NaOH. This means 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n*   The solution at this point is a buffer, containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: `pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])`.\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   The ratio `[conjugate base]/[acid]` is `25% / 75%` = `0.25 / 0.75` = `1/3`.\n*   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3)\n*   Let's compute the exact value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# Calculate pH at 25% titration\n# pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = pKa + log(25/75) = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3)\npH_25_percent = pKa - math.log10(3)\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\n\n# Part 2: pH at equivalence point\n# Initial moles of acetic acid\nconc_acid_initial = 0.025 # M\nvol_acid_initial = 0.040 # L\nmoles_acid = conc_acid_initial * vol_acid_initial\n\n# At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = moles of acid\nconc_NaOH = 0.1 # M\nvol_NaOH_eq = moles_acid / conc_NaOH\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = vol_acid_initial + vol_NaOH_eq\n\n# Concentration of acetate (A-) at equivalence point\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_vol_eq\n\n# Acetate hydrolyzes water: A- + H2O <-> HA + OH-\n# We need Kb for acetate\nKw = 1.0e-14\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-] = x^2 / (conc_acetate - x)\n# Assume x is small, so Kb = x^2 / conc_acetate\n# x = [OH-]\nx_squared = Kb * conc_acetate\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n</execute_result>\n\n**3. Analyze the results from the calculation.**\n*   The Python script first calculates the pH at 25% titration. The result is **4.26**.\n*   Then, the script calculates the necessary parameters for the equivalence point: the initial moles of acid, the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence, the total volume at that point, and the concentration of the resulting acetate solution.\n*   Using the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, it calculates the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻], the pOH, and finally the pH. The result for the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n**4. Match the results to the given options.**\n*   The calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n*   Comparing these with the options:\n    A) 4.57; 6.92\n    B) 4.26; 8.52\n    C) 3.17; 6.73\n    D) 4.73; 7.00\n*   The calculated values perfectly match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Detailed Calculation Walkthrough:**\n\n**Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation:**\n    *   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n    *   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final total volume (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Concentration after dilution (M₂) = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**.\n\n2.  **Buffer System Formation:**\n    *   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has reacted to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means 75% of the initial acetic acid remains.\n    *   The solution now contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which constitutes a buffer.\n\n3.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**\n    *   The pH of a buffer is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        `pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])`\n    *   First, find the pKa from the given Ka:\n        `Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵`\n        `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 4.73`\n    *   The ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of their mole fractions at this point:\n        `[conjugate base]/[acid] = 25% / 75% = 1/3`\n    *   Now, calculate the pH:\n        `pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)`\n        `pH = 4.73 - log(3)`\n        `pH = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253`\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the **pH at 25% titration is 4.26**.\n\n**Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Moles Calculation:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = **0.001 moles**.\n    *   At equivalence, moles of NaOH added = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 moles.\n\n2.  **Volume at Equivalence Point:**\n    *   Calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed:\n        Volume = moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume of the solution = Initial volume + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = **0.050 L**.\n\n3.  **Concentration of Acetate:**\n    *   The concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point is:\n        [CH₃COO⁻] = moles / total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis and pH Calculation:**\n    *   The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes water:\n        CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for this reaction.\n        `Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰`\n    *   Set up the equilibrium expression: `Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]`\n    *   Let `x = [OH⁻]`. Then `[CH₃COOH] = x` and `[CH₃COO⁻] = 0.02 - x`. Since Kb is very small, we can approximate `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`.\n    *   `5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02`\n    *   `x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹`\n    *   `x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) = 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M`\n    *   Calculate pOH: `pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) = 5.48`\n    *   Calculate pH: `pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52`\n    *   The **pH at the equivalence point is 8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. These values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
