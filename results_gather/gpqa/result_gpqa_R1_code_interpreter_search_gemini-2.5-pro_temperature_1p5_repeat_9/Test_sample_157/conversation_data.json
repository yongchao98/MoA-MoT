    "*   **Analysis of the Wild-Type Protein:** The protein is a transcription factor subunit. Its function requires a sequence of events: phosphorylation -> dimerization -> nuclear import -> transcription activation. Dimerization is a crucial step for its function.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mutation X:** This is a recessive loss-of-function mutation in the transactivation domain. \"Recessive\" means that in a heterozygote (one wild-type allele, one mutant X allele), the cell can still produce enough functional wild-type dimers (WT-WT) to carry out the normal function, resulting in a wild-type phenotype. The mutant X protein is produced but is non-functional, or it's not produced at all. Critically, it does not interfere with the wild-type protein.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mutation Y:** This is a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain.\n    *   **Dominant:** The mutation has a phenotypic effect even when a wild-type allele is present.\n    *   **Negative:** The effect is a loss of function.\n    *   **Location:** The mutation is in the dimerization domain.\n    *   **Mechanism of a Dominant-Negative Mutation:** A dominant-negative mutation typically occurs in proteins that function as multimers (e.g., dimers, trimers). The mutant protein product is stable and can still interact with the wild-type protein product. However, the resulting multimer (in this case, a heterodimer of one wild-type subunit and one mutant Y subunit) is non-functional.\n\n*   **Applying the Mechanism to Mutation Y:**\n    1.  A heterozygous cell produces both wild-type (WT) subunits and mutant (Y) subunits.\n    2.  Because the mutation is in the dimerization domain, the mutant Y subunit might form aberrant dimers. It can dimerize with a WT subunit.\n    3.  This forms a WT-Y heterodimer. This heterodimer is \"poisoned\" by the mutant subunit and is non-functional. It cannot perform its transcription factor duties correctly.\n    4.  By forming these non-functional complexes, the mutant Y protein effectively sequesters the functional WT protein, preventing it from forming functional WT-WT dimers.\n    5.  This sequestration and formation of non-functional complexes can be described as a form of protein aggregation (in the sense of forming useless protein clumps/complexes) that leads to a loss of the overall protein function.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype: Incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation does not result in a wild-type phenotype. Also, dimerization isn't necessarily lost; it's aberrant, leading to non-functional dimers.\n    *   B) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele: Incorrect. If the mutant protein were simply degraded, it couldn't interfere with the wild-type protein. This would likely result in a recessive, not a dominant, mutation. The mutation affects the *protein product* of the wild-type allele, not the allele itself.\n    *   C) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype: Correct. The mutant protein forms non-functional complexes with the wild-type protein. This can be viewed as a form of aggregation or aberrant complex formation. This process inactivates the wild-type protein, leading to an overall loss-of-function phenotype, which is the definition of a dominant-negative effect.\n    *   D) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype: Incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation causes a *loss*-of-function, not a gain-of-function.\n\n<<<C>>>"
