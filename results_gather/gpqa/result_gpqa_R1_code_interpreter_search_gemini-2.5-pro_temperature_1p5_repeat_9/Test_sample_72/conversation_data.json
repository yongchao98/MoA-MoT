    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation process.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed\n\nThe problem asks for the relative speed between the two astronauts. Since their velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use the formula for relativistic velocity subtraction.\n\nLet the velocities of the two astronauts in a stationary reference frame be $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$ (velocity of the first astronaut with mass 2m)\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$ (velocity of the second astronaut with mass 3m)\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity ($v_{rel}$) between two objects moving in the same direction is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the formula:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nTo compare with the options, we convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857... c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System\n\nThe total energy ($E$) of a relativistic object is given by the equation:\n$E = \\gamma mc^2$\nwhere $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts.\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate the energy $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3/4}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nNow, calculate the energy $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n\nTo find the numerical value, we use the approximation $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 2 \\times 1.732) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately $0.14c$, and the total energy of the system is approximately $5.96 mc^2$.\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nC) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
