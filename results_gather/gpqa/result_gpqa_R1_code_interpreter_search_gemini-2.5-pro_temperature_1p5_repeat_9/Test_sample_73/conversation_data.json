    "This is a problem about the probability of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key characteristic of this distribution is the **memoryless property**.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the Survival Probability:** Let T be the random variable for the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom survives past time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = P(T > t)`. For radioactive decay, this follows an exponential model: `S(t) = exp(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   This means the probability of *not* decaying (surviving) for 100 minutes is `1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   So, `S(100) = P(T > 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   Using the survival function formula: `exp(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   We can solve for `λ`:\n        *   `-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n        *   `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\n3.  **State the Question in Probability Terms:**\n    *   We are told that 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. This is our given condition: `T > 50`.\n    *   We want to find the probability that it will decay in the *next* 150 minutes. This means it decays between `t=50` and `t=50+150=200`. This event is `50 < T ≤ 200`.\n    *   The question is asking for the conditional probability: `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    *   The memoryless property of exponential decay states that the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of how much time has already passed. Mathematically, `P(T > t + s | T > t) = P(T > s)`.\n    *   This means the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n    *   So, `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    *   We need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - exp(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can substitute the expression for `λ` we found earlier, but there's a more direct way:\n        *   We know `exp(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n        *   We want to find `1 - exp(-150λ)`.\n        *   Let's rewrite `exp(-150λ)` in terms of `exp(-100λ)`:\n            `exp(-150λ) = exp(-1.5 * 100λ) = (exp(-100λ))^1.5`\n        *   So, `exp(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   The probability of decay is `1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n\nLet's compute the final value using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We want to calculate the value of 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\n# P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32 => P(survive 100 min) = 0.68\n# Let S(t) be the survival probability. S(100) = exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n# We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property, this is P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - S(150).\n# S(150) = exp(-lambda * 150) = exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-lambda * 100))**1.5 = 0.68**1.5\n# Probability = 1 - 0.68**1.5\n\nprob = 1 - (0.68**1.5)\nprint(f\"The probability is: {prob}\")\nprint(f\"As a percentage: {prob*100:.2f}%\")\n```\nThe python script calculates `1 - (0.68**1.5)`.

    "The problem deals with radioactive decay, which is governed by the exponential distribution. A crucial feature of this distribution is its **memoryless property**. This property implies that the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of how much time has already passed, given that the object has survived up to the present.\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the Survival Probability:** Let T be the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom survives beyond time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = P(T > t)`. For radioactive decay, this follows the exponential law: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability of decay within time `t` is `P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Decay Constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n    *   This means the probability of *surviving* past 100 minutes is `P(T > 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   Using our survival function: `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   We don't need to solve for `λ` explicitly. This relationship is sufficient.\n\n3.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** The question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   Let the current time be `t_0 = 50`. We want to find the probability of decay between `t_0` and `t_0 + 150`, which is time `t=200`. This is the conditional probability `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`.\n    *   Because of the memoryless property, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. The \"clock\" essentially resets.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand-new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n    *   So, we need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Probability:** We want to find `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can use the relationship we found in step 2: `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   Let's manipulate the exponent: `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`.\n    *   Substitute the known value: `(0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   Now, we calculate the probability of decay: `P = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n\nThe previous Python code calculated this value:\n`1 - (0.68 ** 1.5) ≈ 0.4393`\n\nThis probability, `0.4393`, is equivalent to `43.93%`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 48%\nB) 40%\nC) 52%\nD) 44%\n\nThe calculated value of `43.93%` is closest to `44%`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
