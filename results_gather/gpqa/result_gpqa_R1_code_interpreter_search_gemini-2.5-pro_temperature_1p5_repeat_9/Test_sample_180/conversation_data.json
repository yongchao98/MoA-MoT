    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Event:** The `pp-III` branch of the proton-proton chain reaction in the Sun stops.\n    *   **Timing:** This happened ~8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, the effect of this stoppage is being observed on Earth *now*.\n    *   **Objective:** Calculate the ratio of the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands:\n        *   Band 1: 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV)\n        *   Band 2: 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV)\n    *   **Constraint:** All other reactions (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle, etc.) continue as normal.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Neutrino Sources by Energy:**\n    First, I need to identify which solar reactions produce neutrinos in or near the specified energy bands. The main sources are:\n    *   **pp reaction:** Produces neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to 0.42 MeV (420 keV). This is **below both bands**.\n    *   **pep reaction:** Produces a sharp line of neutrinos at 1.44 MeV. This is **above both bands**.\n    *   **⁷Be reaction (pp-II branch):** This is a key reaction. It produces neutrinos at two discrete energy lines. The dominant line is at **0.861 MeV (861 keV)**. This falls squarely within **Band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n    *   **⁸B reaction (pp-III branch):** This reaction produces neutrinos with a high-energy, continuous spectrum that extends up to ~15 MeV. These neutrinos contribute to the flux across a wide range of energies, including **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n    *   **CNO cycle reactions:** Reactions like the decay of ¹³N and ¹⁵O also produce neutrinos with continuous spectra that overlap with **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Hypothetical Scenario:**\n    The question states that the `pp-III` branch has stopped.\n    *   What does this mean for the neutrino sources? It means the **⁸B neutrinos are no longer being produced**.\n    *   What sources remain? The `pp`, `pep`, `⁷Be`, and `CNO` neutrino sources remain active.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Flux in Each Band *After* the Stoppage:**\n    Now, let's see what neutrino sources contribute to each band under the new conditions (with no ⁸B neutrinos):\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   pp neutrinos? No (too low energy).\n        *   pep neutrinos? No (too high energy).\n        *   ⁷Be neutrinos? No (the line is at 861 keV, outside this band).\n        *   ⁸B neutrinos? No (this source has stopped).\n        *   CNO neutrinos? Yes, their continuous spectrum contributes to this band.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 1:** The only remaining source of neutrino flux is the CNO cycle.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   pp neutrinos? No.\n        *   pep neutrinos? No.\n        *   **⁷Be neutrinos? YES!** The very strong, discrete line at 861 keV is the dominant contributor to this band.\n        *   ⁸B neutrinos? No.\n        *   CNO neutrinos? Yes, their spectrum also contributes a small amount of flux here.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 2:** The flux is the sum of the very large ⁷Be line flux and the smaller CNO flux.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    The ratio we need is: Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2)\n    *   Ratio = (Flux from CNO) / (Flux from ⁷Be + Flux from CNO)\n\n6.  **Compare the Magnitudes of the Remaining Fluxes:**\n    The final step is to compare the size of the CNO flux to the ⁷Be flux. In the Standard Solar Model, the Sun derives only about 1% of its energy from the CNO cycle, with 99% coming from the proton-proton chain. Consequently, the neutrino flux from the pp-chain reactions (like ⁷Be) is vastly greater than the flux from the CNO cycle.\n    *   Flux from ⁷Be >> Flux from CNO\n\n    Therefore, the denominator of our ratio is dominated by the ⁷Be flux:\n    *   (Flux from ⁷Be + Flux from CNO) ≈ Flux from ⁷Be\n\n    Our ratio simplifies to:\n    *   Ratio ≈ (Flux from CNO) / (Flux from ⁷Be)\n\n    Since the CNO flux is very small compared to the ⁷Be flux, this ratio will be a very small number, much less than 1. Looking at the options:\n    *   A) 10.\n    *   B) 1.\n    *   C) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n    *   D) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n\n    Option D (0.01) represents a scenario where the flux in Band 2 is about 100 times larger than the flux in Band 1. This aligns perfectly with the fact that the CNO flux is roughly 1-2% of the ⁷Be flux.\n\n7.  **Final Check:**\n    *   The crucial element is the stopping of the ⁸B neutrino source.\n    *   This leaves Band 1 with only a very small CNO contribution.\n    *   It leaves Band 2 with the massive ⁷Be line contribution, plus a small CNO contribution.\n    *   The ratio of (small number) / (very large number) must be a very small number. 0.01 is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
