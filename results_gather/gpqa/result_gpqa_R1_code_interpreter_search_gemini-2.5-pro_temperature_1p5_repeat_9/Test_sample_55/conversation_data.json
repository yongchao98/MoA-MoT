    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\nThe problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n,l,m> = |3,0,0> (the 3s state) to the final state |1,0,0> (the 1s state). This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. We need to identify a valid pathway and calculate its probability relative to all other possible two-dipole transition pathways.\n\n### 2. Applying Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n*   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n*   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n*   Δn can be any integer.\n\nA direct transition from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> is forbidden by the E1 selection rules because Δl = 0 - 0 = 0. Therefore, the process must go through an intermediate state, let's call it |n',l',m'>.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Intermediate State(s)\n\n#### First Transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>\n*   Initial state: n=3, l=0, m=0.\n*   Applying Δl = ±1: Since l=0, l' must be 1.\n*   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: Since m=0, m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so n' < 3. The most probable intermediate state is the energetically lowest possible one, which is n'=2 (the options also point to n'=2).\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. These correspond to the three sublevels of the 2p orbital.\n\n#### Second Transition: |n',l',m'> → |1,0,0>\nLet's check if transitions from our possible intermediate states to the final state are allowed.\n*   Initial state: |2,1,m'> (with m' = -1, 0, or 1).\n*   Final state: |1,0,0>.\n*   Applying Δl = ±1: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n*   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: Δm = 0 - m'. This is allowed for m' = -1, 0, or 1.\n*   So, all three intermediate 2p states can decay to the 1s final state.\n\nThis confirms there are three possible routes for the cascade decay:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probabilities of the Routes\nThe probability of a specific route depends on the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability of the |3,0,0> state decaying into a specific |2,1,m'> sublevel.\n\nThe transition rate from an initial state `i` to a final state `f` is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, summed over all possible polarizations of the emitted photon:\nRate(i→f) ∝ |⟨f|**d**|i⟩|² = |⟨f|x|i⟩|² + |⟨f|y|i⟩|² + |⟨f|z|i⟩|²\n\nWe need to calculate the relative rates for the decay from |3,0,0> to each of the three |2,1,m'> states.\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state |3,0,0> has l=0, which means it is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay from this symmetric state into the three sublevels (m'=-1, 0, 1), which are only distinguished by their orientation in space, must occur with equal probability. This implies that each route has a probability of 1/3.\n\n*   **Explicit Calculation (using the Wigner-Eckart Theorem):**\n    The rate of transition from an initial state |nlm⟩ to a final state |n'l'm'⟩ is determined by the matrix element. The Wigner-Eckart theorem separates the matrix element's dependence on geometry (the m quantum numbers) from its overall strength (the reduced matrix element).\n\n    The rate for the transition |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'> is proportional to a constant C for each of the three possible values of m' (-1, 0, 1). Let the rate for each transition be R.\n    *   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = R\n    *   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>)  = R\n    *   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)  = R\n\n    The total rate of decay from |3,0,0> to any of the |2,1,m'> states is the sum:\n    Total Rate = R + R + R = 3R.\n\n    The probability (or branching ratio) for the system to take a specific path is the rate for that path divided by the total rate. For example, for the path through the m'=0 intermediate state:\n    Probability(m'=0 route) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) / Total Rate = R / (3R) = 1/3.\n\n    Similarly, the probability for the routes via m'=-1 and m'=1 are also 1/3.\n\n    For the second step of the decay (|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>), it is the only E1-allowed decay channel for the 2p state. Therefore, its probability is 1 (or the branching ratio is 100%).\n\n    The overall probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the probability of the first step.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe three possible routes via the intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are all allowed and are equally probable, each with a probability of 1/3.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 (Correct route and probability)\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3 (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
