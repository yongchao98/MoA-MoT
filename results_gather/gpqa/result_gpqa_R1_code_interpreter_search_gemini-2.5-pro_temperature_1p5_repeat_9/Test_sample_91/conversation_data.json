    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's draw the structure to count the atoms and bonds correctly. The formula represents a single molecule, and we can validate the valency of each carbon atom.\n\n   CH3              CH3                   CH3\n    |                |                     |\nH3C-C == CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH == C - CH3\n\nLet's count the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   (CH3)2C- group: 3 C, 6 H\n*   =CH- group: 1 C, 1 H\n*   -CH2- group: 1 C, 2 H\n*   -CH(CH3)- group: 2 C, 4 H\n*   -CH2- group: 1 C, 2 H\n*   -CH= group: 1 C, 1 H\n*   =C(CH3)2 group: 3 C, 6 H\n\nTotal Carbons = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 carbons.\nTotal Hydrogens = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogens.\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Molar Mass\nThe molar mass of C12H22 is required to convert the final answer from kJ/mol to kJ/g.\nMolar Mass (M) = 12 * (Atomic Mass of C) + 22 * (Atomic Mass of H)\nM ≈ 12 * 12 + 22 * 1 = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Number of Each Type of Bond\nFrom the structure determined in Step 1, we count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: There are two double bonds in the structure: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -**CH=C**(CH3)2. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**:\n    *   From the (CH3)2C= group: 2 C-C bonds.\n    *   From the -CH(CH3)- group: 1 C-C bond.\n    *   From the =C(CH3)2 group: 2 C-C bonds.\n    *   Bonds in the main carbon chain: C=**C-C**-**C-C**-**C=C**. There are 4 single bonds linking the groups along the chain.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   n(C-H) = 22\n*   n(C-C) = 9\n*   n(C=C) = 2\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule\nThe total bond energy (or enthalpy of atomization of the compound) is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound.\nTotal Bond Energy (B.E.) = [n(C-C) × BE(C-C)] + [n(C=C) × BE(C=C)] + [n(C-H) × BE(C-H)]\nGiven values:\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nB.E. = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nB.E. = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants\nThe formation reaction for C12H22 is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of reactants is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states to gaseous atoms (12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g)).\nΔH_atom(reactants) = [12 × ΔH_atom(C)] + [11 × BE(H-H)]\nGiven values:\n*   ΔH_atom(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom(reactants) = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΔH_atom(reactants) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using Hess's Law:\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of the product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 7: Convert the Enthalpy of Formation to kJ/g\nThe options include values in kJ/g, so we must convert our result.\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166\n\nLet's perform this calculation.\n```python\n# Number of bonds\nn_CC_single = 9\nn_CC_double = 2\nn_CH = 22\n\n# Given bond energies (kJ/mol)\nBE_CC_single = 200\nBE_CC_double = 300\nBE_CH = 400\n\n# Given atomization enthalpies (kJ/mol)\nH_atom_C = 1000\nBE_HH = 100\n\n# Number of atoms\nn_C = 12\nn_H = 22\n\n# Step 4: Calculate total bond energy of the product molecule\ntotal_bond_energy_product = (n_CC_single * BE_CC_single) + (n_CC_double * BE_CC_double) + (n_CH * BE_CH)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate total enthalpy of atomization of reactants\n# Reactants are 12 C(s) and 11 H2(g)\ntotal_atomization_energy_reactants = (n_C * H_atom_C) + ((n_H / 2) * BE_HH)\n\n# Step 6: Calculate enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_formation_mol = total_atomization_energy_reactants - total_bond_energy_product\n\n# Step 2: Calculate molar mass (g/mol)\nmolar_mass = (n_C * 12) + (n_H * 1)\n\n# Step 7: Convert enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\nenthalpy_formation_gram = enthalpy_formation_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Total Bond Energy of Product: {total_bond_energy_product} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Total Atomization Energy of Reactants: {total_atomization_energy_reactants} kJ\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation: {enthalpy_formation_mol} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass: {molar_mass} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation: {enthalpy_formation_gram} kJ/g\")\n```\nTotal Bond Energy of Product: 11200 kJ/mol\nTotal Atomization Energy of Reactants: 13100.0 kJ\nEnthalpy of Formation: 1900.0 kJ/mol\nMolar Mass: 166 g/mol\nEnthalpy of Formation: 11.44578313253012 kJ/g\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is **11.446 kJ/g**. This value is extremely close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
