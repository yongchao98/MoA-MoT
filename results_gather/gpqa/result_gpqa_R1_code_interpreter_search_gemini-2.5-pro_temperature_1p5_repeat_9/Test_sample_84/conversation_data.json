    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2 ($T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_*$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   $R_*$ is the radius of the star.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_*$ and $R_*$ are identical for both and cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, the terms $(1-A)^{1/4}$ also cancel out. The simplified ratio becomes:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To solve the problem, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-major Axis to Observational Data:** The radial velocity (RV) method provides information that can be used to determine the semi-major axis. The Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is related to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) by the formula:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    The maximum radial velocity is the RV amplitude, denoted by $K$.\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of RV Amplitudes:** From the given maximum Doppler shifts, we can find the ratio of the RV amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$):\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c (\\Delta \\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0)}{c (\\Delta \\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0)} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n7.  **Connect RV Amplitude to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_*$), and the semi-major axis ($a$). The detection by both transit and RV methods implies an edge-on orbit (inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, so $\\sin i \\approx 1$). From the conservation of momentum in the star-planet system, and the formula for a planet's orbital velocity, we can derive the following relationship (assuming $M_p \\ll M_*$):\n    $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_*} v_p = \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    where $v_p$ is the planet's orbital velocity and $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n8.  **Solve for the Semi-major Axis ($a$):** We can rearrange the above equation to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\left( \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\right)^2 \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n9.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):** Now we can form the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet2 and Planet1:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_2^2}{M_* K_2^2}}{\\frac{G M_1^2}{M_* K_1^2}}$\n    The terms $G$ and $M_*$ are constants and cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 / K_2^2}{M_1^2 / K_1^2} = \\left( \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^2$\n\n10. **Substitute Known Values:** We have the ratio of masses ($M_2/M_1 = 5 M_E / 7 M_E = 5/7$) and the ratio of RV amplitudes ($K_1/K_2 = 3/4$). Let's substitute these into the equation:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n11. **Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio:** Finally, we substitute the ratio $a_2/a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n12. **Numerical Value:** To compare with the given options, we compute the numerical value.\n    $15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option D.\n\nI will use Python to perform the final calculation and verify the result.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given ratios\n# Mass of Planet 1 = 7 Earth masses\n# Mass of Planet 2 = 5 Earth masses\nM_ratio_2_over_1 = 5 / 7\n\n# Doppler shift for Planet 1 = 0.03 Å\n# Doppler shift for Planet 2 = 0.04 Å\n# The ratio of RV amplitudes (K1/K2) is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts\nK_ratio_1_over_2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes (a2/a1) is (M2/M1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (M_ratio_2_over_1**2) * (K_ratio_1_over_2**2)\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1/T_eq2) is sqrt(a2/a1)\nT_ratio_1_over_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(f\"{T_ratio_1_over_2:.4f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.5357.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 ($T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio for the Two Planets:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures as:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$, and the term $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ cancels out.\n    *   The remaining terms simplify to:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$).\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-major Axis to Observational Data:** The radial velocity (RV) method gives us the amplitude of the star's wobble ($K$). For a planet in a circular orbit, this amplitude is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the semi-major axis ($a$) by the following formula (assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass):\n    $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-major Axis ($a$):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\left( \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\right)^2 \\frac{G M_{star}}{a} = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p,2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p,1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)}$\n    The constants $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p,1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Determine the Input Ratios from the Problem Statement:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** $M_{p,1} = 7 M_{Earth}$, $M_{p,2} = 5 M_{Earth}$. So, $\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio ($K_1/K_2$):** The RV amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$), since $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$. Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\n9.  **Substitute the Ratios to find $a_2/a_1$:**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute the value of $a_2/a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 4:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n11. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n12. **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of ~0.536 is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
