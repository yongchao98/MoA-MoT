    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information from the Spectra and Description:**\n\n*   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core formula for this part is C6H4.\n*   **FTIR:** An ester group is present. This is a functional group with the structure R-COO-R', containing one C=O bond and one C-O bond. It adds two oxygen atoms (O2) to the formula.\n*   **1H NMR - Aromatic Region:** There are two signals for aromatic protons. A disubstituted benzene ring gives two signals for its aromatic protons only when it has a plane of symmetry, which is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substitution pattern**. Ortho (1,2) and meta (1,3) substitution would each result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **1H NMR - Vinyl Region:** There are two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-).\n    *   One signal is a **doublet**. This means the proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n    *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets**. The \"doublet\" part arises from coupling to the other vinyl proton. The \"quartet\" part (splitting into 4 lines) arises from coupling to three equivalent adjacent protons, which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. Let's label the protons: R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3. Proton H(a) is split by H(b) into a doublet. Proton H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and by the three protons of the CH3 group into a quartet, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n*   **1H NMR - Alkyl Region:**\n    *   There are **two signals for -CH3 groups**. We've already identified one from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This methyl group is adjacent to a vinyl proton, so it would appear as a doublet.\n    *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group. Since there are no -CH2- groups, the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or anything larger. It must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3). In either case, the methyl group is isolated and would appear as a singlet.\n    *   The fragment containing the ester and the second methyl group has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n*   **No -CH2- groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that rules out many possibilities like ethyl, propyl, or allyl groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from the deduced fragments to find the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic ring (para-substituted):** C6H4\n*   **Propenyl side chain:** C3H5\n*   **Ester and methyl part:** C2H3O2\n\nTotal count:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\nThe DBE is a useful check.\n*   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n\nLet's check the DBE from the proposed structure:\n*   Benzene ring = 1 ring + 3 π-bonds = 4 DBE\n*   C=C double bond in the propenyl group = 1 DBE\n*   C=O double bond in the ester group = 1 DBE\n*   Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**\nThe calculated DBE matches the DBE derived from the formula, confirming that C11H12O2 is the correct formula for the described structure.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options:**\n\n*   A) C12H12O2\n*   B) C11H14O2\n*   C) C11H12O2\n*   D) C12H14O2\n\nOur derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
