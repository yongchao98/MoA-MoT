    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gas Separation Process**\n    The gaseous mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. We need to identify what each tube absorbs and calculate the amount of substance absorbed.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** Magnesium perchlorate is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** Calcium hydroxide solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** The gas that passes through all tubes without reacting amounts to 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP). It is inert to a strong desiccant, a base, and hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   Molar volume of any gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n        *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Verify the Composition and Mass**\n    The decomposition products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. Let's check if their total mass equals the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Total Mass of Products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    This matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g), confirming that these are the only products and our calculations are correct.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n    The products (H₂O, N₂, O₂) indicate that the original salts must contain Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O) atoms. Since the decomposition yields only gases, the salts are likely composed entirely of non-metals. The most common cation fitting this description is ammonium (NH₄⁺). The anions would then be oxygen-containing ions of nitrogen, i.e., nitrite (NO₂⁻) or nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n\n    Let's hypothesize:\n    *   **Salt A is Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n    *   **Salt B is Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n    Now let's look at their decomposition reactions:\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   The decomposition of NH₄NO₃ can vary. The products N₂, O₂, and H₂O suggest the reaction: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n4.  **Check Stoichiometry with Experimental Data**\n    The problem states the mixture of A and B is equimolar. Let 'n' be the moles of salt A and 'n' be the moles of salt B.\n\n    Based on the reactions, n moles of each salt would produce:\n    *   From n moles of NH₄NO₂: n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n    *   From n moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the ratio 1 mol → 1 mol N₂ + 0.5 mol O₂ + 2 mol H₂O): n moles of N₂, 0.5n moles of O₂, and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\n    Total moles of products from the mixture:\n    *   Total N₂ = n (from A) + n (from B) = 2n\n    *   Total O₂ = 0.5n (from B)\n    *   Total H₂O = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = 4n\n\n    Now we use our experimental mole values to find 'n':\n    *   From O₂: 0.025 mol = 0.5n  => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   From N₂: 0.10 mol = 2n      => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   From H₂O: 0.20 mol = 4n      => n = 0.05 mol\n\n    All three calculations yield n = 0.05 mol, which strongly confirms our hypothesis about the identities of salts A and B and their reaction pathways.\n\n5.  **Final Verification with Molar Masses**\n    Let's check if 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ add up to 7.20 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14+4(1)+14+2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14+4(1)+14+3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    This matches the given total mass perfectly.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n    The question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = 8 (from A) + 9 (from B) = 17.\n\n```python\n# Moles of products\nmoles_H2O = 3.60 / 18.0\nmoles_O2 = 0.80 / 32.0\nmoles_N2 = 2.24 / 22.4\n\n# Verify total mass\ntotal_product_mass = (moles_H2O * 18.0) + (moles_O2 * 32.0) + (moles_N2 * 28.0)\nprint(f\"Total Product Mass: {total_product_mass:.2f} g\") # Should be 7.20 g\n\n# From stoichiometry: O2_moles = 0.5 * n\n# So, n = O2_moles / 0.5\nn = moles_O2 / 0.5\n\n# Molar masses\nM_NH4NO2 = 14 + 4*1 + 14 + 2*16\nM_NH4NO3 = 14 + 4*1 + 14 + 3*16\n\n# Verify total initial mass\ncalculated_initial_mass = n * M_NH4NO2 + n * M_NH4NO3\nprint(f\"Calculated Initial Mass: {calculated_initial_mass:.2f} g\") # Should be 7.20 g\n\n# Calculate number of atoms\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2  # NH4NO2 -> N2H4O2\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3  # NH4NO3 -> N2H4O3\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n>>>\nTotal Product Mass: 7.20 g\nCalculated Initial Mass: 7.20 g\nTotal number of atoms: 17\n<<<\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process that led to the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products from the Decomposition**\n    The problem describes passing a mixture of gases through a series of tubes, which separate the components based on their chemical properties.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent (desiccant), so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 1.01 * 2 + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts containing carbonate or sulfite anions.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 16.00 * 2 = 32.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** A gas that doesn't react with a strong desiccant, a base, or hot copper is very likely nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   The molar volume of a gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n        *   Moles of N₂ = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Verify Mass Conservation**\n    Let's check if the total mass of the gaseous products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × (14.01 * 2 g/mol) = 2.80 g\n    *   Total Mass of Products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    This exactly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g), confirming that H₂O, O₂, and N₂ are the only products.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Identity of the Salts**\n    *   The products contain Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   The decomposition produced only gases, which suggests the salts are composed of non-metallic ions. The most common cation in this category is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n    *   The anions must contain nitrogen and oxygen. The two most common are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are likely **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) (Salt A)** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) (Salt B)**.\n\n4.  **Write and Balance the Decomposition Reactions**\n    Let's write the thermal decomposition reactions for these two salts that would produce the observed products.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** The decomposition can proceed in multiple ways. The reaction that produces N₂, O₂, and H₂O is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n5.  **Use Stoichiometry and the \"Equimolar\" Condition**\n    The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of Salt A and also the number of moles of Salt B.\n\n    Let's calculate the total moles of each product based on the reactions and the initial 'n' moles of each salt:\n    *   **Total Moles of N₂:** n (from A) + (2/2)n (from B) = n + n = **2n**\n    *   **Total Moles of O₂:** 0 (from A) + (1/2)n (from B) = **0.5n**\n    *   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 2n (from A) + (4/2)n (from B) = 2n + 2n = **4n**\n\n    Now we can use the experimental moles calculated in Step 1 to solve for 'n':\n    *   From O₂: 0.025 mol = 0.5n  => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   From N₂: 0.10 mol = 2n      => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   From H₂O: 0.20 mol = 4n      => n = 0.05 mol\n    All calculations consistently give **n = 0.05 mol**. This confirms our identification of the salts and the reactions is correct.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms in the Formulas**\n    The question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of Salt A and Salt B combined.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** It contains 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** It contains 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total Atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n7.  **Final Answer**\n    The total number of atoms is 17, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
