    "*   **Analysis of the context:** The conversation is happening between two synthetic organic chemists. A key part of synthetic chemistry is not just making a new compound but also purifying it from the reaction mixture, which contains leftover starting materials, byproducts, and the desired product.\n*   **Analysis of the phrase:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" is a colloquialism used in chemistry labs. It's a visual metaphor. We need to think about which common laboratory technique would lead to a visual representation where compounds could be described as being \"on top of each other.\"\n*   **Evaluation of common purification techniques:**\n    *   **Chromatography (Thin-Layer Chromatography - TLC, or Column Chromatography):** This is one of the most common purification techniques in organic chemistry. It separates compounds based on their differential affinity for a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This affinity is primarily determined by the compound's **polarity**.\n        *   On a TLC plate, compounds appear as spots. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel up the plate at nearly the same speed, and their spots will be very close together or even completely overlap, literally appearing \"on top of each other.\" This indicates a failed separation.\n        *   In column chromatography, compounds elute from the column as bands. If two compounds have similar polarities, their bands will overlap and elute at the same time, making them impossible to separate into different collection flasks. Plotting the concentration over time would show two overlapping peaks, which could be described as being \"on top of each other.\"\n*   **Evaluation of the answer options:**\n    *   **A) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a physical property measured with a polarimeter. It doesn't directly relate to a common separation technique in a way that would be described as \"on top of each other.\" A failed measurement is not the same as a failed separation.\n    *   **B) Similar polarities:** As explained above, this is the direct cause of failed separation by chromatography. If the polarities are too similar, the compounds cannot be resolved and will appear \"on top of each other\" on a TLC plate or will co-elute from a column. This perfectly matches the chemist's complaint.\n    *   **C) Bonding through non-covalent interactions:** While intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces) are the underlying physical reason for properties like polarity and boiling point, the chemist's statement is about the practical consequence of these properties in a lab procedure, not the fundamental forces themselves. The problem isn't that they are bonding, but that this leads to similar physical properties that prevent separation.\n    *   **D) Similar boiling points:** This would make separation by distillation difficult. However, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more characteristic of chromatography slang than distillation slang. One would be more likely to say \"they co-distill\" or \"their boiling points are too close.\"\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is classic lab jargon for a failed separation attempt using chromatography (TLC or column), which occurs when the compounds have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<B>>>"
