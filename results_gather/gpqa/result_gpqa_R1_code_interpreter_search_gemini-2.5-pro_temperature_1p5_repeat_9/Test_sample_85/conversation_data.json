    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**: This describes a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring). It's saturated (tetrahydro). There's a carbonyl group (ketone/one) at position 2. This structure is a lactone (a cyclic ester), specifically a delta-lactone.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the carbon at position 4 of the ring.\n*   The IUPAC numbering for lactones starts with the ring oxygen as position 1, and the carbonyl carbon as position 2. So the structure is an O-C(=O)-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2 ring.\n*   The carbon at position 4, which bears the ethyl group, is a chiral center. The two reactions produce the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this product.\n\nA lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. For a six-membered delta-lactone, the precursor is a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The precursor to our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid** (HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH). The chiral center in this precursor is at C3, which becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for starting materials A and B are enantiomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is a non-standard IUPAC name, but it most plausibly describes a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid (also known as 3-ethylpentanedioic acid).\n*   **Structure**: iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH.\n*   This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOiBu).\n*   It has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group), which corresponds to the chiral center in the final lactone product.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe goal of each reaction is to convert the starting diester-acid into the lactone. This requires reducing one of the two carbonyl groups to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) and then inducing cyclization. The key to solving this problem is the different chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3.\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a strong, but selective, reducing agent. In a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH4 will preferentially reduce the **ester** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated by the basic hydride to form a carboxylate salt, which is much less reactive towards reduction.\n*   **BH3 (Borane)**: This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It is particularly effective at reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, and it does so much faster than it reduces esters.\n\n**4. Trace the Pathway for Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction**: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Starting Material**: A = `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction)**: LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group is mostly unreacted.\n*   **Step 2 (Workup & Cyclization)**: The acid workup (H+) protonates the intermediate carboxylate salt, yielding the hydroxy-acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid). This molecule then cyclizes (lactonizes), often promoted by the acidic conditions, to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: These reaction steps (reduction of a group away from the chiral center, lactonization) do not affect the stereochemistry at the C3 position. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A must be the (R)-enantiomer**.\n\n**5. Trace the Pathway for Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction**: B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Starting Material**: B = `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction)**: BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group is left intact.\n*   **Step 2 (Workup & Cyclization)**: The intermediate after reduction is a hydroxy-ester: `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`. During the workup or upon heating, this molecule undergoes an intramolecular transesterification: the terminal -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: As in the first reaction, these steps do not affect the existing chiral center. The configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B must be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
