    "This problem requires applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms over various energy levels in a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. The problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which justifies the use of this equation.\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy states (say, an excited state 2 and a lower state 1) to the temperature of the system:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   `N₂` and `N₁` are the number of atoms in the excited state and the lower state, respectively.\n*   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the two energy levels. These are properties of the atom and are the same for both stars.\n*   `ΔE = E₂ - E₁` is the energy difference between the two states.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.3806 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Applying the Equation to the Two Stars\n\nLet's define the ratio of the population in the excited state to the population in the lower state as `R = N₂ / N₁`. This ratio is a measure of the \"excitation\" of the atoms.\n\nFor Star 1, with temperature T₁:\nR₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\nFor Star 2, with temperature T₂:\nR₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n### 3. Using the Information from the Problem\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited ... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the excitation ratio `R` for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2:\n\nR₁ = 2 * R₂\n\nNow we can substitute the expressions from the Boltzmann equation:\n\n(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\nThe term `(g₂ / g₁)` is a constant for the specific atomic transition and can be canceled from both sides:\n\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n### 4. Algebraic Manipulation\n\nTo find the relationship between T₁ and T₂, we need to solve this equation.\n\nFirst, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(exp(x)) = x):\n\n-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + [-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n\nΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:\n\n(ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T₂) - (1 / T₁) ] = ln(2)\n\nCombine the fractions inside the brackets by finding a common denominator (T₁ * T₂):\n\n(ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)\n\n### 5. Incorporating the Given Numerical Values\n\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information:\n*   The energy difference `ΔE` is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n*   The Boltzmann constant `k` is 1.3806 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nThe problem is designed so that the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1 K:\n\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting `ΔE / k = 1` into our derived equation:\n\n1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThis equation matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
