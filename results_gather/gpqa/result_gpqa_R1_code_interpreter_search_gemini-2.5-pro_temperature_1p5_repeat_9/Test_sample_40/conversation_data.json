    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let S be the laboratory frame where the observer is at rest.\n    *   Let S' be the frame of reference that is moving with the glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam.\n    *   `u'`: The speed of the light beam relative to the glass (in frame S').\n    *   `u`: The speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory (in frame S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n    *   `c`: The speed of light in a vacuum. The problem sets `c=1`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (S'):**\n    *   The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium at rest (`u_medium`).\n    *   In frame S', the glass is at rest, so the speed of light in the glass is `u' = c/n`.\n    *   Since the problem specifies `c=1`, we have `u' = 1/n`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    *   According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, velocities do not simply add up linearly. The formula for adding two velocities `v` and `u'` that are in the same direction is:\n        `u = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u') / c^2)`\n    *   Here, `u` is the resultant velocity in the stationary frame S, `v` is the velocity of the moving frame S', and `u'` is the velocity of the object within the moving frame S'.\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    *   We have `v` = `v`.\n    *   We have `u'` = `1/n`.\n    *   We have `c` = `1`.\n\n    Substituting these into the velocity addition formula:\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + (v * (1/n)) / 1^2)`\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n        `u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n        `u = (n*v + n*(1/n)) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n        `u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n\n    *   Rearranging the terms in the numerator gives:\n        `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated speed `u` matches option A.\n\n    *   A) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    *   C) 1\n    *   D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe correct answer is (1+n*v)/(n+v).\n\n<<<A>>>"
