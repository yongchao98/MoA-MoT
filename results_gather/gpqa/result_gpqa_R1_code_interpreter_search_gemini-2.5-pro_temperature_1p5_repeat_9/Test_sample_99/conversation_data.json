    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence and an analysis of each statement.\n\n**Reaction Sequence Analysis**\n\n1.  **Compound A to Compound B:**\n    *   Compound A has the molecular formula C3H6, which corresponds to propene (CH3-CH=CH2) or cyclopropane.\n    *   The reaction is bromination in CCl4, which is a characteristic electrophilic addition reaction for alkenes.\n    *   A: Propene (CH3-CH=CH2)\n    *   Reaction: CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 → CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n    *   B: 1,2-Dibromopropane\n\n2.  **Compound B to Compound C:**\n    *   Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This reagent causes dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, two molecules of HBr are eliminated to form an alkyne.\n    *   Reaction: CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH(alc.) → CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n    *   C: Propyne\n\n3.  **Compound C to Compound D:**\n    *   Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This condition promotes the cyclic polymerization of alkynes to form aromatic compounds. Three molecules of propyne will trimerize.\n    *   Reaction: 3 CH3-C≡CH --(Red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene\n    *   D: 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)\n\n4.  **Compound D to Compound E:**\n    *   Compound D (mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This is the standard condition for nitration (conc. HNO3 + conc. H2SO4). The three methyl groups are activating and ortho, para-directing. Due to symmetry, all available positions (2, 4, 6) are equivalent.\n    *   Reaction: Mesitylene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n    *   E: 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n\n5.  **Compound E to Compound F:**\n    *   Compound E (a nitro compound) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   Reaction: 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n    *   F: 2,4,6-Trimethylaniline (Mesidine)\n\n6.  **Compound F to Compound G:**\n    *   Compound F (an aromatic primary amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, typically from NaNO2/HCl at 0-5°C). This is a diazotization reaction.\n    *   Reaction: 2,4,6-Trimethylaniline + HNO2 → 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium salt\n    *   G: 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium salt\n\n7.  **Compound G to Compound H:**\n    *   Compound G (a diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide. Typically, warming the aqueous solution of a diazonium salt results in its hydrolysis to a phenol. The NaOH neutralizes the acid and forms the sodium salt of the phenol.\n    *   Reaction: 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium salt + H2O --(Warm, NaOH)--> 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol\n    *   H: 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol (Mesitylol)\n\n**Evaluation of the Statements**\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to its high symmetry, the three protons on the benzene ring are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons, so they appear as one singlet. The nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups also appear as one singlet.\n    *   Therefore, the 1H NMR spectrum of D shows two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is characteristic for most phenols, typically yielding a violet, purple, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored [Fe(OAr)6]3- complex.\n    *   However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the two methyl groups at the ortho positions cause significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the bulky phenol molecules from coordinating with the Fe3+ ion to form the colored complex.\n    *   Consequently, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol does not give a positive ferric chloride test. The solution may appear yellow, but this is the color of the FeCl3 reagent itself, not a positive result.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for the production of azo dyes, which are a large class of synthetic colorants. Aniline and its derivatives are diazotized and then coupled with other aromatic compounds to create dyes.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne (CH3C≡CH). It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature and pressure. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\nThe incorrect statement is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
