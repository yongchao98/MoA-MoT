    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Gas W:** The clue states that the molecule of gas W contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Let's consider simple diatomic gases.\n    *   H₂ (Hydrogen gas): Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. The H₂ molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. They are not equal.\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Deuterium (D) is a heavy isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has (1+1) = 2 protons and (1+1) = 2 neutrons. The numbers are equal. This is a very strong candidate for gas W.\n    *   N₂ (Nitrogen gas): The most common isotope ¹⁴N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This also fits. However, the release of nitrogen gas from a violent reaction with a liquid is less common in this context than the release of hydrogen.\n    *   Given the first clue about a \"heavier isotope\", D₂ is the most likely identity of gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:**\n    *   The problem states \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W\".\n    *   If gas W is D₂ (deuterium), then substance X must contain deuterium. A violent reaction that produces hydrogen (or its isotope) is characteristic of a reactive metal hydride/deuteride with a protic substance like water.\n    *   To produce pure D₂ gas, the reaction must be between a metal deuteride (let's call it MDₙ) and heavy water (D₂O). The reaction would be: `MDₙ + n D₂O → M(OD)ₙ + n D₂`.\n    *   If the liquid Y were normal water (H₂O), the gas produced would be HD (`MDₙ + n H₂O → M(OH)ₙ + n HD`), which has 2 protons but only 1 neutron, not fitting the description of gas W.\n    *   Therefore, Gas W is D₂, Liquid Y is D₂O (heavy water), and Substance X is a metal deuteride.\n\n3.  **Identify Precipitate G and Substance B:**\n    *   The reaction is `X + D₂O → D₂ (W) + G (precipitate)`. From our deduction, the reaction is `MDₙ + n D₂O → M(OD)ₙ (G) + n D₂ (W)`. So, G is a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₙ.\n    *   Precipitate G, when heated, releases B. Metal hydroxides (and deuteroxides) decompose upon heating to form a metal oxide and water (or heavy water). So: `M(OD)ₙ → Metal Oxide + B`. This means substance B must be D₂O.\n    *   To confirm this, the problem states the melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\". The melting point of normal water is 273.15 K (0 °C). Let's check the melting point of heavy water (D₂O).\n\n<search>melting point of D2O in kelvin</search>\n<information>\nThe melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K.\n</information>\n\n    *   The melting point of D₂O is 276.97 K, which is indeed very close to 277 K. This confirms that Y and B are D₂O, W is D₂, and G is a metal deuteroxide.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X using Organic Chemistry Clues:**\n    *   The clue states \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" and \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   This points to X being a reducing agent. Common metal hydride reducing agents used in organic chemistry are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated analogs (and thus candidates for X) are LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄.\n    *   A keto acid has the general structure R-CO-COOH, containing a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids. The reduction of R-CO-COOH would yield a diol, R-CD(OH)-CH₂OH. This final product contains **2 oxygen atoms**, which perfectly matches the clue.\n    *   NaBH₄ (and NaBD₄) is a milder agent. It reduces ketones but not carboxylic acids. The reduction would yield R-CD(OH)-COOH. This product also has **2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   To distinguish between LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄, we revisit earlier clues. The reaction is described as \"violent,\" and a \"precipitate G forms.\" LiAlH₄ reacts much more violently with water than NaBH₄. Furthermore, in the reaction `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`, aluminum deuteroxide `Al(OD)₃` is an insoluble precipitate. In the reaction with NaBD₄, the products `NaOD` and `B(OD)₃` are both soluble.\n    *   Therefore, the evidence strongly points to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its isotopic form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   We need the atomic masses for the calculation. We'll use the mass numbers of the most common/relevant isotopes: Li = 7, Al = 27, D = 2.\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest and heaviest elements**.\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (represented by Deuterium, D).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄. There are 4 atoms of Deuterium and 1 atom of Aluminum.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen as D): 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative mass = Mass from D + Mass from Al = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nLet's use a python script to confirm the final calculation.\n```python\n# Mass numbers for the isotopes in LiAlD4\n# Deuterium (D), the heavy isotope of Hydrogen (H), is the lightest element.\nmass_D = 2\n# Aluminum (Al) is the heaviest element.\nmass_Al = 27\n\n# Number of atoms in the LiAlD4 molecule\nnum_D = 4\nnum_Al = 1\n\n# Calculate the total mass contribution from the lightest element (Hydrogen)\ntotal_mass_lightest = num_D * mass_D\n\n# Calculate the total mass contribution from the heaviest element (Aluminum)\ntotal_mass_heaviest = num_Al * mass_Al\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass as requested\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_lightest + total_mass_heaviest\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "An in-depth analysis of the problem statement allows for the systematic identification of each substance involved.\n\n1.  **Identify Gas W and Liquid Y:** The problem describes Gas W as having an equal number of protons and neutrons. A prime candidate for such a molecule is Deuterium gas (D₂). Each Deuterium atom (an isotope of Hydrogen) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description. The first clue also mentions \"a heavier isotope\", which strongly supports the presence of Deuterium. A violent reaction that produces a gas is characteristic of a reactive hydride (or deuteride) reacting with a protic substance like water. For the gas produced to be pure D₂, Substance X (a deuteride) must react with heavy water (D₂O), which would be Liquid Y. The reaction would be of the form: `Metal-Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal-Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G and Substance B:** The reaction produces a precipitate G, which, upon heating, releases B. Following the reaction from step 1, G would be a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)ₙ`. When heated, metal hydroxides (and deuteroxides) decompose into a metal oxide and water (or heavy water). Therefore, B must be D₂O. To confirm this, the problem states B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\". The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C), while the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C), which is indeed very close to 277 K. This confirms that B is D₂O, and by extension, Y is also D₂O.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** The problem provides clues from organic chemistry:\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    This points to X being a deuterated version of a common reducing agent. The two most common hydride-based reducing agents are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs, and thus candidates for X, are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has two reducible groups: a ketone and a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **LiAlD₄** is a powerful reducing agent and would reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols, yielding a diol: `R-CD(OH)-CH₂OD`. After a workup with normal water, the product would be `R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH`, which contains **2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **NaBD₄** is a milder agent and would only reduce the ketone, leaving the carboxylic acid intact, yielding `R-CD(OH)-COOH`. This product also contains **2 oxygen atoms**.\n    To distinguish between the two, we revisit the reaction's description. The reaction is \"violent\" and forms a \"precipitate G\". LiAlH₄ reacts much more violently with water than NaBH₄. Furthermore, its reaction with D₂O produces Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD, soluble) and Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃, **insoluble precipitate**). In contrast, the reaction products of NaBD₄ with D₂O are soluble. Therefore, Substance X must be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements. We use the integer mass numbers for the most common isotopes: D = 2, Li = 7, Al = 27.\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (represented by Deuterium, D). There are 4 Deuterium atoms. Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al). There is 1 Aluminum atom. Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass from all Deuterium atoms) + (Mass from all Aluminum atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n```python\n# Atomic mass numbers for the isotopes in LiAlD4.\n# Deuterium (D) is the heavy isotope of the lightest element, Hydrogen.\nmass_D = 2\n# Aluminum (Al) is the heaviest element.\nmass_Al = 27\n\n# Number of atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\nnum_D = 4\nnum_Al = 1\n\n# Sum the mass contributions of the lightest element (all its isotopes/instances).\ntotal_mass_lightest_element = num_D * mass_D\n\n# Sum the mass contributions of the heaviest element (all its isotopes/instances).\ntotal_mass_heaviest_element = num_Al * mass_Al\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_lightest_element + total_mass_heaviest_element\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
