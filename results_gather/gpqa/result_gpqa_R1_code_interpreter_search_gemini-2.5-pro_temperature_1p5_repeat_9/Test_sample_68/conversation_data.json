    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics Principles\nThe problem involves concepts from special relativity and particle physics:\n*   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer in the laboratory frame than in its own rest frame.\n*   **Relativistic Energy and Momentum:** The energy and momentum of the particle determine its speed and Lorentz factor.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** Unstable particles decay randomly, following an exponential decay law. The characteristic distance for this decay is the mean decay length.\n*   **Detector Resolution:** To \"observe\" a decay track, the track length must be greater than the minimum resolution of the detector.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\nThe Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, relates the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n\nThe formula is $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$.\nSo, $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.91788$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L_{mean}$)\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying.\nThe proper lifetime (mean lifetime in the rest frame) is $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\nThe mean lifetime in the lab frame is $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\nThe particle's velocity is $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\nThe mean decay length is $L_{mean} = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta\\gamma c \\tau_0$.\n\nA convenient relativistic identity is $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\nSo, $L_{mean} = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2-1}$.\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n*   $\\gamma \\approx 7.91788$\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n$\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{(7.91788)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{62.6928 - 1} = \\sqrt{61.6928} \\approx 7.8544$\n$L_{mean} = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times 7.8544$\n$L_{mean} = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times 7.8544 \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n### 4. Interpret the Observation Condition\nThe condition is to \"observe at least 30% of the decays\".\nObserving a decay means being able to resolve the track of the particle $X^0$ before it decays. This is only possible if the track length, $x$, is greater than the detector's spatial resolution, let's call it $d_{res}$.\nSo, we need to find the value of $d_{res}$ such that the fraction of particles with a decay length $x > d_{res}$ is at least 30%.\n\nThe probability of a particle surviving to a distance $x$ follows the exponential decay law: $P(\\text{distance} > x) = e^{-x/L_{mean}}$.\nWe require this probability to be at least 0.30:\n$e^{-d_{res}/L_{mean}} \\ge 0.30$\n\n### 5. Solve for the Minimum Resolution\nTo find the boundary condition, we solve the equality:\n$e^{-d_{res}/L_{mean}} = 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-d_{res}/L_{mean} = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res} = -L_{mean} \\ln(0.30) = L_{mean} \\ln(1/0.30)$\n$d_{res} = L_{mean} \\ln(10/3)$\n\nUsing $\\ln(10/3) \\approx 1.204$:\n$d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis value represents the largest possible resolution (i.e., the \"worst\" detector) that can still observe at least 30% of the decays. The phrasing \"minimum resolution\" is slightly ambiguous, but in this context, it refers to this limiting value.\n\n### 6. Compare with Options and Final Answer\nOur calculated value is $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\nLet's look at the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n\nThe calculated value is of the order of $10^{-6}$ m, which matches option C. The numerical value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest to option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy (around 9%) is likely due to slight inaccuracies or rounding in the values provided in the problem statement. Given the choices, C is the only plausible answer.\n\nWe can perform the calculation using a script for better precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nE = 27  # GeV\nm0 = 3.41 # GeV/c^2\ntau0 = 8e-16 # s\nc = 299792458 # m/s\n\n# 1. Calculate Lorentz factor gamma\ngamma = E / m0\n\n# 2. Calculate the mean decay length L_mean\n# L_mean = c * tau0 * beta * gamma = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nL_mean = c * tau0 * math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# 3. Calculate the required resolution d\n# We need to observe at least 30% of decays, so P(x>d) >= 0.3\n# exp(-d/L_mean) >= 0.3  =>  -d/L_mean >= ln(0.3)  => d <= -L_mean * ln(0.3)\n# The minimum resolution in the sense of the limiting value is d = L_mean * ln(1/0.3)\nd = L_mean * math.log(1 / 0.3)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated mean decay length is L_mean = {L_mean:.3e} m\")\nprint(f\"The required resolution is d = {d:.3e} m\")\n```\nThe calculated mean decay length is L_mean = 1.884e-06 m\nThe required resolution is d = 2.268e-06 m\n\nThe computed value $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal\nThe objective is to find the minimum spatial resolution ($d_{res}$) a detector needs to observe the decay tracks of at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles. An observation is possible if the particle's travel distance before decay is greater than the detector's resolution.\n\n### 2. Understand the Physics Concepts\n*   **Relativistic Time Dilation:** A particle moving at a relativistic speed has its lifetime extended in the laboratory frame compared to its own rest frame (proper lifetime). The factor of this extension is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy $E$ of a particle is related to its rest mass $m_0$ and its Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ by the equation $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(\\text{distance} > x) = e^{-x/L_{mean}}$, where $L_{mean}$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Mean Decay Length:** This is the average distance a particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is calculated as $L_{mean} = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau_{lab}$ is its mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 3.1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy.\n\n*   Total energy, $E = 27$ GeV.\n*   Rest mass, $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$. So, rest mass energy is $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n\n**Step 3.2: Calculate the Particle's Velocity (in terms of $\\beta = v/c$)**\nThe velocity factor $\\beta$ is related to $\\gamma$ by:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(7.9179)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.01595} \\approx \\sqrt{0.98405} \\approx 0.9920$\n\n**Step 3.3: Calculate the Mean Lifetime in the Lab Frame ($\\tau_{lab}$)**\nThe lifetime in the lab is dilated by the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n\n$\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.9179 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15}$ s.\n\n**Step 3.4: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L_{mean}$)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels at speed $v = \\beta c$ during its lab lifetime $\\tau_{lab}$.\n\n$L_{mean} = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau_0$\nUsing the relativistic identity $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$:\n$\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{(7.9179)^2 - 1} \\approx \\sqrt{62.69 - 1} \\approx 7.854$\n$L_{mean} = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times 7.854 \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nThis is the average distance an $X^0$ particle travels before decaying.\n\n**Step 3.5: Determine the Required Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nWe need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the fraction of particles whose decay track length ($x$) is greater than the resolution ($d_{res}$) must be at least 0.30.\n\n$P(x > d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n\nUsing the exponential decay law:\n$e^{-d_{res}/L_{mean}} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the limiting value, we solve the equality:\n$e^{-d_{res}/L_{mean}} = 0.30$\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{d_{res}}{L_{mean}} = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res} = -L_{mean} \\cdot \\ln(0.30) = L_{mean} \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.30}\\right)$\n$d_{res} \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(3.333...)$\n$d_{res} \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe calculated resolution required is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. We compare this result with the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n\nThe calculated value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m has the same order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) as option C and is numerically closest to it. The slight difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's given values. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
