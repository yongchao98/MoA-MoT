    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **Identify Functional Groups and Fragments:**\n        *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet integrating to 3 protons in this region is highly characteristic of an acetate methyl group (CH₃-C=O). All four options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n        *   **Proton Count:** The total number of protons is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n            *   Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂) has 3 (on propene) + 2 (on propene) + 3 (on acetate) = 8 hydrogens (wait, let's write it out: CH₃-CH=CH-O-Ac, so 3+1+1+3 = 8H). This matches.\n            *   Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂) has 10 hydrogens. This does not match.\n            *   Therefore, we can immediately eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and C). We are left with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n    2.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n        *   We have two signals in the alkene (vinylic) region: 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm. These correspond to the two protons on the C=C double bond.\n        *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n        *   The coupling constant (J-value) between two vinylic protons is highly diagnostic of the double bond's geometry.\n            *   A **trans** arrangement typically shows a large coupling constant, usually in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n            *   A **cis** arrangement shows a smaller coupling constant, typically **6-12 Hz**.\n        *   Since the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, this strongly indicates a **trans** configuration. This eliminates the Cis-propenyl acetate option (D).\n\n    3.  **Confirm the Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n        *   The proposed structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n            ```\n                O\n               //\n            H-C----C-O-C-CH₃(a)\n              |    |\n              H(b) H(c)-CH₃(d)\n            ```\n        *   Let's assign the signals to the protons in this structure:\n            *   **Protons (a):** The acetate methyl group. It has no adjacent protons, so it appears as a singlet. This corresponds to the signal at **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**.\n            *   **Protons (d):** The methyl group on the double bond. It is coupled to the single proton (c) on the adjacent carbon, so it appears as a doublet. This corresponds to the signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**.\n            *   **Proton (c):** This vinylic proton is coupled to proton (b) (one proton, giving a doublet) and the methyl group (d) (three protons, giving a quartet). The signal should be a doublet of quartets (dq). This corresponds to the signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**.\n            *   **Proton (b):** This vinylic proton is coupled to proton (c) (one proton), so it appears as a doublet. It is attached to the carbon bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom, which deshields it, causing it to appear further downfield (at a higher ppm value). This corresponds to the signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The proton count eliminates the butenyl options, and the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) confirms the trans stereochemistry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
