    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2 and is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field in the +Z direction.\n*   The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `H = -μ ⋅ B`.\n*   The magnetic moment operator `μ` is proportional to the spin operator `S`, so `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   For a magnetic field `B_z` in the +Z direction, `H = -γS ⋅ (B_z ẑ) = -γB_z Sz`.\n*   The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are the eigenstates of `Sz`: spin-up `|+z>` with energy `E_+ = -γB_z(ħ/2)` and spin-down `|-z>` with energy `E_- = +γB_z(ħ/2)`.\n*   \"Aligned\" means the particle is in the lowest energy state. Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `E_+`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   So, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In matrix form, `|+z> = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian for Time Evolution\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction.\n*   The new Hamiltonian `H'` that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H' = -μ ⋅ (Bŷ) = -γS ⋅ (Bŷ) = -γB Sy`.\n*   The spin operator `Sy` is given by `Sy = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   So, `H' = -γB(ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation's evolution operator:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n\nThis can be solved in two ways:\n\n**Method A: Using Eigenstates of the New Hamiltonian**\n\n1.  Find the eigenstates of `H'` (which are the eigenstates of `Sy`).\n    *   The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are:\n        *   `|+y>` (eigenvalue +ħ/2): `(1/√2) [[1], [i]] = (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        *   `|-y>` (eigenvalue -ħ/2): `(1/√2) [[1], [-i]]` -> Let me recheck this from the thought process. My previous calculation gave `(1/√2)[i, 1]`. Let's stick to the rotation operator method which is less prone to error in eigenvector definitions.\n\n**Method B: Using the Rotation Operator (More Direct)**\n\nThe time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ)` can be seen as a rotation operator.\n`U(t) = exp(-i(-γB Sy)t/ħ) = exp(i(γBt)Sy/ħ)`\n\nThis operator represents a rotation around the Y-axis by an angle `θ = -γBt`.\nThe general rotation operator around the Y-axis is `R_y(θ) = exp(-iθSy/ħ) = cos(θ/2)I - i sin(θ/2)σ_y`.\nHere, our evolution operator `U(t)` corresponds to `R_y(-γBt)`.\n`U(t) = cos(-γBt/2)I - i sin(-γBt/2)σ_y = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y`\nIn matrix form:\n`U(t) = cos(γBt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(γBt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n`U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n\nNow, apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`:\n`|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] [[1], [0]]`\n`|ψ(t)> = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\nIn terms of the Z-basis vectors, this is:\n`|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the moment, `<μz(t)>`.\n`<μz(t)> = <ψ(t)| μz |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γSz |ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\n\nFirst, calculate `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`.\n`Sz = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n`<Sz(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<-z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * (Sz) * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n`Sz` acts on the kets: `Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `Sz|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`.\n`Sz|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z> = (ħ/2)(cos(γBt/2)|+z> + sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n\nNow, take the inner product with `<ψ(t)|`:\n`<Sz(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * (ħ/2)(cos(γBt/2)|+z> + sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\nUsing the orthogonality of the basis vectors (`<+z|+z>=1`, `<+z|-z>=0`, etc.), we get:\n`<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we have:\n`<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expression for `<μz(t)>` is a cosine function `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω` is:\n`ω = γB`\n\nThis is the famous Larmor frequency. The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is `ω`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe calculated frequency `γB` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
