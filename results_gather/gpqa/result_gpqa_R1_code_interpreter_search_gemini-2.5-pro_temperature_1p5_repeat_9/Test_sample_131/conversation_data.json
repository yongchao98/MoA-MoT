    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Clues**\n\n*   The molecular formula for both compounds is C10H14.\n*   All options provided are isomers with this formula.\n    *   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C6H2 + C4H12 -> C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 -> C6H4 + C4H10 -> C10H14. (Correct)\n*   The spectrum is of a 1:1 molar mixture. This means the total signal intensity from each compound is equal.\n\n**2. Analyze the Aliphatic Region (around 2.2 ppm)**\n\n*   The data shows three signals, all of which are **singlets**, in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n*   The presence of only singlets for the alkyl groups is a very strong clue. It means none of the protons on the alkyl carbons are adjacent to other protons. This is characteristic of methyl (-CH3) groups attached to the aromatic ring or a quaternary carbon, but not ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl, or isopropyl groups, which would show splitting (quartets, triplets, etc.).\n*   Let's examine **1,4-diethylbenzene**. The two ethyl groups would produce a quartet (for the -CH2- protons) and a triplet (for the -CH3 protons) in the aliphatic region. This contradicts the data that all signals are singlets.\n*   **Conclusion:** 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated. This immediately rules out option A.\n\n**3. Analyze the Aromatic Region (around 6.7 ppm)**\n\n*   The data shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound produces **one singlet** in the aromatic region, and these two singlets have slightly different chemical shifts.\n*   Let's predict the aromatic signals for the remaining three tetramethylbenzene isomers based on their symmetry.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6). Due to the planes of symmetry, these two protons are chemically equivalent. They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**. This compound fits the requirement.\n\n         \n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   This molecule has less symmetry. There are two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6). The proton at C4 is in a different chemical environment from the proton at C6. Therefore, they are not equivalent and will produce **two distinct singlets (1H each)**. This compound does *not* fit the requirement of producing only one aromatic signal. This rules out options B and D, as they both contain this compound.\n\n         \n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two adjacent aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent (which would normally lead to splitting), because they are chemically and magnetically equivalent, they behave as a single group and produce a **single singlet (2H)**. This compound fits the requirement.\n\n         \n\n**4. Confirm the correct pair by analyzing the combined Aliphatic Signals**\n\n*   Based on the aromatic signals, the only possible pair is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Option C). Let's verify this by checking if their combined aliphatic signals match the data (three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n    *   **Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to high symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12 protons (4 x CH3).\n\n    *   **Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to its plane of symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent methyl groups:\n        1.  The \"outer\" methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** (6H).\n        2.  The \"inner\" methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives a second **singlet** (6H).\n\n*   **Combining the spectra:**\n    *   In the 1:1 mixture, we will see the signals from both compounds.\n    *   Total number of aliphatic singlets = 1 (from 1,2,4,5-isomer) + 2 (from 1,2,3,4-isomer) = **3 singlets**. This matches the data.\n    *   The integrals of these three signals will be 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all the given NMR data (aromatic and aliphatic regions) is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
