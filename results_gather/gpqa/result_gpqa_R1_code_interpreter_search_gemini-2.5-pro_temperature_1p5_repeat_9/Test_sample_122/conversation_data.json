    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference: the Galaxy's frame and the ejecta's frame.\n    *   The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time that passes in the ejecta's reference frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured in the frame of the moving clock (the ejecta).\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Physical Principle:**\n    *   The speed `v` is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2` or 20% of the speed of light). Therefore, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically **time dilation**.\n    *   Time dilation describes how an observer in one frame of reference perceives time passing for a moving object in another frame. The observer in the \"stationary\" frame (the Galaxy) will see the clock in the \"moving\" frame (the ejecta) ticking more slowly. This means more time will pass in the Galaxy's frame than in the ejecta's frame.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor, `γ`, quantifies the effect of time dilation. It is calculated using the formula:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²) `\n    *   First, find `(v/c)²`:\n        `v/c = 0.2`\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   The time dilation formula is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n        where `Δt` is the time measured in the Galaxy's frame and `Δt'` is the proper time measured in the ejecta's frame.\n    *   `Δt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds passed for the ejecta, about 51.031 seconds passed for an observer in the Galaxy.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame:**\n    *   To find the distance the ejecta traveled as measured by an observer in the Galaxy, we multiply the ejecta's speed (relative to the Galaxy) by the time that passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   `Distance = v * Δt`\n    *   `Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s`\n    *   `Distance ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n    *   The calculated distance, approximately 3,061,860 km, is closest to option B.\n\nThe Python code executed in the background confirms this calculation precisely, yielding `3,061,862.17...` km, which rounds most closely to `3,060,000` km.\n\n<<<B>>>"
