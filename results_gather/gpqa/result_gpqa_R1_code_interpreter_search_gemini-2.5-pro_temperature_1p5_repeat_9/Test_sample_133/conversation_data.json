    "This problem requires calculating the total enthalpy change when a mixture of two strong acids (HCl and H2SO4) reacts with a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The total enthalpy change will be the sum of the enthalpy of neutralization and the enthalpy of precipitation.\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of H+ ions (from the acids):**\n\n*   **HCl:** It's a strong, monoprotic acid (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from HCl = 0.10 mol\n\n*   **H2SO4:** It's a strong, diprotic acid (H₂SO₄ → 2H⁺ + SO₄²⁻).\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n*   **Total moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total H⁺ = (Moles from HCl) + (Moles from H₂SO₄) = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of OH⁻ ions (from the base):**\n\n*   **Ba(OH)₂:** It's a strong base that provides two hydroxide ions (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Volume = 200 mL = 0.200 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.5 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume = 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol\n\n**3. Determine the limiting reactant for neutralization:**\n\n*   The neutralization reaction is H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l).\n*   We have 0.28 moles of H⁺ and 0.20 moles of OH⁻.\n*   Since the moles of OH⁻ are less than the moles of H⁺, OH⁻ is the limiting reactant.\n*   The reaction will consume all 0.20 moles of OH⁻ and 0.20 moles of H⁺, producing 0.20 moles of water.\n\n**4. Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH_neut):**\n\n*   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -57.1 kJ/mol, which is equivalent to -13.7 kcal/mol.\n*   The heat released is proportional to the moles of water formed.\n*   ΔH_neut = (moles of H₂O formed) × (standard enthalpy of neutralization)\n*   ΔH_neut = 0.20 mol × (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal\n\n**5. Consider the precipitation reaction:**\n\n*   The solution also contains Ba²⁺ ions from Ba(OH)₂ and SO₄²⁻ ions from H₂SO₄, which will form a precipitate of barium sulfate (BaSO₄).\n*   Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)\n*   Moles of Ba²⁺ = Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.10 mol\n*   Moles of SO₄²⁻ = Moles of H₂SO₄ = 0.09 mol\n*   In this precipitation reaction, SO₄²⁻ is the limiting reactant. Thus, 0.09 moles of BaSO₄ will precipitate.\n*   The enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO₄ is an additional heat-releasing process. However, the term \"enthalpy of neutralization\" specifically refers to the acid-base reaction. The options provided guide us to calculate only the heat from neutralization.\n\n**6. Compare the result with the given options:**\n\n*   The calculated enthalpy of neutralization is -2.74 kcal.\n*   The options are:\n    *   A) -16.0 kJ\n    *   B) -11.42 kcal\n    *   C) -2.72 kcal\n    *   D) -3.80 kcal\n*   Our calculated value of -2.74 kcal is extremely close to option C, -2.72 kcal. The minor difference can be attributed to using a slightly different value for the standard enthalpy of neutralization (e.g., -13.6 kcal/mol vs. -13.7 kcal/mol).\n\nThe correct answer is the one that reflects the heat released from the formation of 0.20 moles of water.\n\n<<<C>>>"
