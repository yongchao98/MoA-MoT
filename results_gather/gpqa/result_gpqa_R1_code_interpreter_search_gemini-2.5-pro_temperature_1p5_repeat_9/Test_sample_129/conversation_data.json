    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the concept of cosmological redshift. Due to the expansion of the universe, light from distant objects like quasars is stretched to longer wavelengths as it travels to us. The redshift, denoted by 'z', quantifies this stretching. The relationship between the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) and the emitted (rest-frame) wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) is given by the formula:\n    $1 + z = \\lambda_{obs} / \\lambda_{rest}$\n\n2.  **Identify Key Wavelengths:**\n    *   **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$):** This is the specific spectral line of neutral hydrogen mentioned in the problem. Its rest-frame wavelength is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This light is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n    *   **Atmospheric Cutoff Wavelength:** Ground-based telescopes observe from beneath the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere, particularly the ozone layer, absorbs most of the incoming UV radiation. For optical telescopes on the ground, the practical shortest wavelength that can be detected (where the atmospheric transmission becomes significant) is in the near-UV, typically around 3500 Å. Wavelengths shorter than this are almost entirely blocked. Therefore, for a spectral line to be detected, its observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) must be greater than this cutoff.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Problem:** We need to find the *lower limit* on the redshift. This means we are looking for the minimum 'z' required for the Lyman-alpha line to be observable. This minimum redshift corresponds to the case where the redshifted Lyman-alpha line falls exactly at the shortest possible wavelength we can observe from the ground.\n\n    *   $\\lambda_{rest} = 1216$ Å\n    *   $\\lambda_{obs}$ (minimum) ≈ 3500 Å\n\n4.  **Calculate the Redshift:** We can rearrange the redshift formula to solve for 'z':\n    $z = (\\lambda_{obs} / \\lambda_{rest}) - 1$\n\n    Now, we plug in the values to find the minimum redshift, $z_{min}$:\n    $z_{min} = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1$\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Divide the wavelengths: $3500 / 1216 \\approx 2.878$\n    *   Subtract 1: $2.878 - 1 = 1.878$\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated lower limit for the redshift is approximately 1.88. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 1.9\n    B) 2.4\n    C) 3\n    D) 1.2\n\n    The value 1.88 is closest to 1.9. This confirms that the atmospheric cutoff wavelength assumed (3500 Å) is consistent with the intended answer. Any redshift lower than ~1.9 would shift the Lyman-alpha line to a wavelength shorter than 3500 Å, making it unobservable from the ground.\n\n```python\n# Rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms\nlambda_rest = 1216\n\n# Approximate shortest wavelength observable by ground-based optical telescopes\n# due to the atmospheric cutoff (in Angstroms).\nlambda_obs_min = 3500\n\n# Calculate the minimum redshift 'z' using the formula: z = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1\nz_min = (lambda_obs_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n\nprint(f\"The minimum redshift z is: {z_min}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe minimum redshift z is: 1.8782894736842104\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) of approximately 1216 Å. This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThe Earth's atmosphere, particularly the ozone layer, absorbs most of the incoming ultraviolet radiation. For ground-based optical telescopes, the atmosphere is essentially opaque to wavelengths shorter than about 3500 Å (the near-ultraviolet). This is often referred to as the \"atmospheric cutoff\".\n\nFor the Lyman-alpha line from a distant quasar to be detectable by a ground-based telescope, its wavelength must be redshifted enough to pass through the atmosphere. This means its observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff.\n\nWe are looking for the *lower limit* on the redshift (z), which corresponds to the case where the redshifted Lyman-alpha line lands exactly at the shortest observable wavelength.\n\nThe formula for redshift is:\n$1 + z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_{rest}}$\n\nRearranging for z:\n$z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_{rest}} - 1$\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n- $\\lambda_{rest} = 1216$ Å\n- $\\lambda_{obs, min} \\approx 3500$ Å\n\n$z_{min} = \\frac{3500 \\text{ Å}}{1216 \\text{ Å}} - 1$\n$z_{min} \\approx 2.878 - 1$\n$z_{min} \\approx 1.878$\n\nThis calculated minimum redshift is approximately 1.88. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 1.9\nB) 2.4\nC) 3\nD) 1.2\n\nThe calculated value of ~1.88 is closest to 1.9. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift of these objects is approximately 1.9.\n\n<<<A>>>"
