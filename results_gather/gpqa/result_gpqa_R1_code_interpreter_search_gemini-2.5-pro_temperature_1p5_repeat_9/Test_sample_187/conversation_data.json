    "Here's my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to find the interplanar distance (d-spacing) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice parameter, a = 10 Angstrom (assuming \"interatomic distance\" refers to the rhombohedral lattice constant).\n    *   Interaxial angles, α = β = γ = 30°. In a rhombohedral system, the three angles are equal, so we only need α.\n    *   Miller indices of the plane (hkl) = (111).\n\n3.  **Find the Relevant Formula:** I need the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal system. A search for this formula yields:\n    \n    1/d² = [(h²+k²+l²)sin²α + 2(hk+kl+lh)(cos²α - cosα)] / [a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)]\n    \n    This formula looks complex, but it's the correct one.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula (if possible):** Since we are dealing with the specific (111) plane, I can substitute h=1, k=1, l=1 into the formula to see if it simplifies.\n    \n    *   For (111), h = 1, k = 1, l = 1.\n    *   h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3.\n    *   hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3.\n    \n    Let's substitute these into the numerator:\n    Numerator = [3 * sin²α] + [2 * 3 * (cos²α - cosα)]\n    Numerator = 3sin²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα\n    \n    Using the identity sin²α = 1 - cos²α:\n    Numerator = 3(1 - cos²α) + 6cos²α - 6cosα\n    Numerator = 3 - 3cos²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα\n    Numerator = 3 + 3cos²α - 6cosα\n    Numerator = 3(1 - 2cosα + cos²α)\n    Numerator = 3(1 - cosα)²\n    \n    Now let's look at the denominator part `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)`. This is a cubic polynomial in `cosα`. I can try to factor it. Let x = cosα. The polynomial is `2x³ - 3x² + 1`. By inspection, x=1 is a root (2-3+1=0), so `(x-1)` is a factor. Polynomial division or synthetic division gives: `(2x³ - 3x² + 1) / (x-1) = 2x² - x - 1`.\n    The quadratic `2x² - x - 1` can be factored into `(2x+1)(x-1)`.\n    So, the denominator part is `(x-1)(x-1)(2x+1) = (x-1)²(2x+1)`.\n    Substituting back `x = cosα`:\n    `1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α = (cosα - 1)²(2cosα + 1) = (1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`\n    \n    Now, I can rewrite the full formula for the (111) plane:\n    1/d₁₁₁² = [3(1 - cosα)²] / [a² * (1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)]\n    \n    The `(1 - cosα)²` terms cancel out, leaving a much simpler formula:\n    1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [a²(1 + 2cosα)]\n    \n    Or, solving for d₁₁₁:\n    d₁₁₁² = a²(1 + 2cosα) / 3\n    d₁₁₁ = a * sqrt[(1 + 2cosα) / 3]\n    \n    This simplified formula is specific to the (hhh) type planes in a rhombohedral system and is much easier to work with.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:** Now I'll plug the given values into the simplified formula.\n    *   a = 10 Å\n    *   α = 30°\n    *   cos(30°) = √3 / 2\n    \n    1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [10² * (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2))]\n    1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [100 * (1 + √3)]\n    \n    d₁₁₁² = [100 * (1 + √3)] / 3\n    d₁₁₁ = √([100 * (1 + √3)] / 3)\n    d₁₁₁ = 10 * √((1 + √3) / 3)\n    \n    Now, I'll use a calculator (or a Python script for precision) to get the numerical value.\n\n6.  **Use a Python Script for Precision:** To avoid rounding errors, I will use Python to compute the final value. I can use either the original complex formula or the simplified one. The simplified one is less prone to typing errors.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0\n\n# Convert angle to radians for Python's math functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Calculate cos(alpha)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n\n# Use the simplified formula for the (111) plane\n# d_111 = a * sqrt((1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3)\nd_111_squared = (a**2 * (1 + 2 * cos_alpha)) / 3\nd_111 = math.sqrt(d_111_squared)\n\nprint(d_111)\n```\n\n7.  **Execute the Code and Interpret the Result:**\n    \n    The code execution returns `9.542974533993186`.\n    \n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    A) 10.05 Angstrom\n    B) 9.08 Angstrom\n    C) 9.54 Angstrom\n    D) 8.95 Angstrom\n    \n    The calculated value, 9.543 Å, is extremely close to option C.\n\n9.  **Final Answer Formulation:** I will state the final answer based on the calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>",

Simplification for the (111) plane:**\nFor the (111) plane, we have h=1, k=1, and l=1.

Calculation:**\nNow, we can solve for `d` and plug in the given values:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{a^2(1+2\\cos\\alpha)}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1+2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\n\nGiven `a = 10` Angstrom and `α = 30°`:\n*   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2 ≈ 0.866`\n\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1+2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3}} $$\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nTo get a precise numerical value, we can use a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values for the rhombohedral crystal\na = 10.0  # interatomic distance in Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0 # angles in degrees\n\n# Convert the angle from degrees to radians for use in Python's math functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Calculate the cosine of the angle alpha\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n\n# For the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula for interplanar distance simplifies to:\n# d = a * sqrt((1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3)\n\n# Calculate the term inside the square root\nterm_inside_sqrt = (1 + 2 * cos_alpha) / 3\n# Calculate the interplanar distance d_111\nd_111 = a * math.sqrt(term_inside_sqrt)\n\nprint(d_111)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n**5.

    "To solve this problem, we need the formula for the interplanar distance `d` in a rhombohedral crystal system for a plane with Miller indices (h, k, l).\n\n**1.
