    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   This reaction is a classic example of **cyanohydrin formation**. Butan-2-one is a ketone. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n    *   The mechanism proceeds in two steps:\n        1.  **Nucleophilic attack:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon, breaking the C=O double bond and forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n            `CH3-CO-CH2-CH3 + CN⁻ ---> CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n        2.  **Protonation:** The negatively charged oxygen atom (the alkoxide) is then protonated by a proton source to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n            `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3 + H⁺ ---> CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3` (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    *   The role of reagent **A** is to provide this proton (H⁺). The reaction is typically performed by adding a mineral acid after the initial nucleophilic attack, or by using a buffered, slightly acidic solution. Therefore, a source of protons like **H₃O⁺** (hydronium ion, formed by adding an acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ to water) is required for this step.\n    *   NaHSO₃ would lead to a different product, a bisulfite addition product, not a cyanohydrin.\n    *   Thus, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n    *   The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The reaction proceeds via an amide intermediate.\n    *   Given the options, we are looking for a catalyst **B** to be used with water (H₂O).\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** `R-CN + 2H₂O + H⁺ ---> R-COOH + NH₄⁺`\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** `R-CN + H₂O + OH⁻ ---> R-COO⁻ + NH₃` (requires a final acidification step to get R-COOH)\n    *   The product shown is the carboxylic acid (R-COOH), not the carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻), which strongly suggests acid catalysis is the intended direct route.\n    *   **HCl** is a strong acid and is a common reagent for this purpose. It effectively catalyzes the complete hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and would not be effective enough to drive the hydrolysis to completion under typical conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺** and reagent **B** is **HCl**.\n    *   This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
