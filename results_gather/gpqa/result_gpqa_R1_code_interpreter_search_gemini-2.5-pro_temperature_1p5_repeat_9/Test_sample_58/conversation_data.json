    "This problem requires us to determine the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The final pH will depend on what species is in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of acids and bases.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely (HCl → H+ + Cl-).\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol H+\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates completely to yield two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-).\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol OH-\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will react first with the strong acid (H+ from HCl), and then with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid-Strong Base Neutralization**\n    *   H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   Initial moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH- = 0.180 mol\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH- than H+, all the strong acid will be neutralized.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid-Strong Base Neutralization**\n    *   CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- available (from Reaction 1) = 0.100 mol\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH- than CH3COOH, all the weak acid will be neutralized.\n    *   Moles of excess OH- remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final concentration of excess OH- and determine the pH.**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of OH- ions. The pH of the final solution is determined by this excess strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = (Moles of excess OH-) / (Total Volume)\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
