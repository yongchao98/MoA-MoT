    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n### **1. Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where a bromine atom is at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) is at position 2. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Reagent and Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the amide anion, NH2⁻, is the active species), and liquid ammonia is a polar solvent.\n\n### **2. Determine the Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe reaction of an aryl halide that has a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent (ortho) to the halogen-bearing carbon with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, commonly known as the **benzyne mechanism**.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Mechanism**\n\n#### **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base, NH2⁻, abstracts an acidic proton from one of the ortho positions (C-2 or C-6) to the bromine atom. This is the elimination step.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen (H) from C-6**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH2⁻) removes a proton (H⁺) from the C-6 position.\n    2.  This is generally the faster process due to the **kinetic isotope effect**, as the C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond.\n    3.  A carbanion is formed at C-6. This carbanion is unstable and rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n    4.  The result is the formation of a highly reactive intermediate called a benzyne. In this case, a triple bond forms between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium (D) from C-2**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH2⁻) removes a deuteron (D⁺) from the C-2 position.\n    2.  This process is slower than H⁺ abstraction but is still possible.\n    3.  A carbanion is formed at C-2, which then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n    4.  A triple bond forms between C-1 and C-2. Since the deuterium was abstracted from C-2, the resulting benzyne intermediate has no deuterium atom. This is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n     \n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture: **3-deuterobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n#### **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe nucleophile in the solution, the amide ion (NH2⁻), now attacks the electrophilic carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This is the addition step. After the attack, the resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. These two positions are not equivalent because of the adjacent deuterium at C-2.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH2⁻ group adds to C-1. This creates a carbanion at C-6. Protonation of C-6 by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C-1 and the deuterium is at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline** (or *ortho*-deuterioaniline).\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The NH2⁻ group adds to C-6. This creates a carbanion at C-1. Protonation of C-1 by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C-6 and the deuterium is at C-2. By IUPAC nomenclature (numbering from the -NH2 group), this is **3-deuterioaniline** (or *meta*-deuterioaniline).\n\n     \n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate B (benzyne)**\n    The triple bond is between C-1 and C-2, and there is no deuterium.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** The two carbons of the triple bond are equivalent. Attack by NH2⁻ at either carbon, followed by protonation by NH3, leads to the same single product. This product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n     \n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing the two possible initial elimination pathways and the subsequent addition reactions, we find three distinct possible organic products:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
