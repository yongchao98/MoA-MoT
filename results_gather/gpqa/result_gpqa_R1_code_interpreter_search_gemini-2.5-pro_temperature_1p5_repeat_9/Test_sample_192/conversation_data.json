    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. In astrophysics and physics, when a quantity \"varies with\" a variable, it typically refers to the density or distribution function. So, we interpret the given information as the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    We can write this as a proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, `r`, per unit range of distance. This is asking for the functional form of `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Find the Relationship between Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance to the star (when distance is measured in parsecs and parallax in arcseconds). The relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule of calculus. However, since the number of stars `dN` in a corresponding interval of parallax `d(plx)` and distance `dr` must be positive, it's safest to use the formula for transforming probability distributions, which involves the absolute value of the Jacobian (the derivative of the transformation).\n    The formula is:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    The absolute value is:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Pieces into the Transformation Formula:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` and `|d(plx)/dr|` into our formula from step 4.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²) `\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of `r`:**\n    The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. To get the final answer in terms of `r` only, we substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression.\n    `dN/dr ∝ ( (1/r)⁻⁵ ) * (1/r²) `\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Using the rules of exponents (`(a/b)⁻ⁿ = (b/a)ⁿ` and `aⁿ * aᵐ = aⁿ⁺ᵐ`):\n    `(1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n    So, the expression becomes:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * (1/r²) `\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * r⁻² `\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵⁻² `\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³ `\n\nConclusion: The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r³`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
