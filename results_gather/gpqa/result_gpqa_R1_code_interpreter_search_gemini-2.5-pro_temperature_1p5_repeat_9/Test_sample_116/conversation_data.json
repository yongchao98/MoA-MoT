    "**Thinking Process**\n\nThe user wants me to identify which of the four given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**1. Understand Optical Isomerism:**\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are:\n*   **Chiral center (or stereocenter):** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Axial chirality:** Found in molecules that have a chiral axis due to restricted rotation around a bond. Common examples are substituted biphenyls (atropisomers), allenes, and spiranes.\n*   **Planar chirality:** Found in molecules where a plane is chiral.\n*   A key test for achirality is the presence of an internal plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) or a center of inversion (i). If a molecule has either of these symmetry elements, it is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Compound:**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system. Two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   The positions ortho to this central bond (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) at 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) at 6 and 6'.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The bulky substituents at all four ortho positions sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This lack of free rotation is a prerequisite for a type of axial chirality known as atropisomerism. To be chiral, the molecule must not be superimposable on its mirror image. We check for planes of symmetry.\n    *   Consider one of the rings. It has a -COOCH3 group at position 2 and a -NO2 group at position 6. Since these two substituents are different, the ring itself is not symmetric with respect to the axis of the biphenyl bond. The same applies to the second ring.\n    *   Because of the restricted rotation and the lack of symmetry within each ring, the molecule as a whole lacks an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image will be a non-superimposable enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality (atropisomerism).\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group). We identify the four groups attached to it:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH3 (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon atom is a chiral center (stereocenter). A molecule with one chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound has a chiral center and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon: (C6H5)-C(=O)-(C6H5).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is symmetrical. The two phenyl groups are identical. We can identify a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule that possesses an internal plane of symmetry is achiral. It has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar and highly symmetrical. It has a center of inversion (a center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you draw a line from any atom through this point, you will find an identical atom at an equal distance on the opposite side. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. It also has a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the molecule, bisecting the C=C bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It is a stereoisomer, specifically a geometric isomer or diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, but it is not an optical isomer).\n\n**3. Final Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
