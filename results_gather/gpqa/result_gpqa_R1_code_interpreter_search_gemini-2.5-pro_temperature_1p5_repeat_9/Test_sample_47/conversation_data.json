    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) to form product 1.**\nThis is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. The reaction occurs at the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). Cyclohexanone is symmetric, so bromination at either α-carbon gives the same product.\n*   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form product 2.**\nAn α-haloketone reacting with a strong base like NaOH can undergo several reactions. The two main possibilities are E2 elimination or a Favorskii rearrangement.\n*   **Pathway A (Favorskii Rearrangement):** The base removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6) to form an enolate. This enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide and forming a bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one). The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl group, leading to the opening of the strained three-membered ring. This results in the formation of a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylate group. After neutralization, the product is a carboxylic acid. This reaction is a ring contraction.\n    *   **Product 2 would be cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n*   **Pathway B (E2 Elimination):** The base removes a proton from the β-carbon (C3), leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Product 2 would be cyclohex-2-en-1-one.**\n\nTo decide which pathway is correct, we look at the next step.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine to form product 3.**\nThionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides (-COOH → -COCl). It does not have a standard, clean reaction with ketones or α,β-unsaturated ketones like cyclohex-2-en-1-one under these conditions. The fact that this reagent is used strongly implies that product 2 is a carboxylic acid.\n*   This confirms that the reaction in Step 2 was a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n*   Product 2 reacts with SOCl₂ to form **Product 3, which is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) to form product 4.**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms (or sets of equivalent hydrogen atoms) in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This corresponds to the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule. The molecule is achiral. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon it's attached to, the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n\nThis plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their attached hydrogens chemically equivalent:\n*   C2 is equivalent to C5.\n*   C3 is equivalent to C4.\n\nNow, let's count the distinct hydrogen environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 distinct type of H)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 distinct type of H)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** Each of these carbons has two protons. On C2, the two protons are diastereotopic because they are in a different spatial relationship to the rest of the molecule (specifically the aldehyde group). They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule. Therefore, they are chemically non-equivalent. The same is true for the two protons on C5. However, due to the plane of symmetry, the \"upper\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"upper\" proton on C5, and the \"lower\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"lower\" proton on C5. So, the four protons on C2 and C5 together constitute two distinct sets of equivalent protons. (2 distinct types of H)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to the corresponding protons on C4. Thus, the four protons on C3 and C4 give rise to two distinct signals. (2 distinct types of H)\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming up the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (from CHO) + 1 (from C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
