    "*   **Analysis of the Scenario:**\n    *   **Antigen Delivery:** Rotavirus proteins (antigens) are delivered orally, mimicking a natural infection of the gut.\n    *   **Immune Response Location:** The response is observed in Peyer's patches, which are key secondary lymphoid organs for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n    *   **Cellular Activity:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. This strongly suggests the formation of a germinal center, where B cells undergo rapid proliferation after activation by an antigen and T-helper cells.\n    *   **Genetic Change:** The key finding is \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells. The variable region of an antibody is what binds to the antigen.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system involving a cascade of serum proteins. It does not involve genetic changes in lymphocytes.\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that occurs within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). It specifically introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains) of proliferating B cells. This process generates antibodies with varying affinities for the antigen, and those with higher affinity are selected for survival. This directly explains the \"high variability\" observed in the \"variable heavy chain gene.\"\n    *   **C) V(D)J recombination:** This process creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors by combining different Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) gene segments. However, this occurs in the bone marrow during the development of na√Øve B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. It is not a process that occurs in proliferating, antigen-activated cells in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n    *   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. It changes the constant region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the antibody's function. However, CSR does *not* affect the variable region of the heavy chain. The question specifically mentions variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The combination of a proliferating cell population in a Peyer's patch and high variability in the variable region of the heavy chain gene is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation occurring during a germinal center reaction to an antigen.\n\n<<<B>>>"
