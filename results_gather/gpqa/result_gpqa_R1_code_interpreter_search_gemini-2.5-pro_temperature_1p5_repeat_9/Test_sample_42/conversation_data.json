    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the description and draw the structure\n\nFirst, we need to translate the textual description into a chemical structure. Let's place the groups on a benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Identify the main groups:** We have a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN) that are all *meta* to one another. The most logical way to arrange this is to place them at positions 1, 3, and 5 on the ring. Let's arbitrarily assign the carboxylic acid to position 1 for now, as it will likely be the principal functional group.\n    *   Position 1: -COOH\n    *   Position 3: -CHO (carbaldehyde)\n    *   Position 5: -CN (cyano)\n\n2.  **Add the remaining substituents relative to the carboxylic acid (-COOH):**\n    *   *Ortho* to the carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1) are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)₂). The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, {-OH, -N(CH3)₂} are at {C2, C6}.\n    *   *Para* to the carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1) is a methoxy group (-OCH₃). The para position is C4. So, -OCH₃ is at C4.\n\n3.  **Use the final piece of information to resolve ambiguities:**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" The nitrile (-CN) is at C5. The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   We already placed the methoxy group (-OCH₃) at C4, which is indeed ortho to C5. This is consistent.\n    *   This means the alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must be in the other ortho position, which is C6.\n    *   If the -OH group is at C6, then the dimethylamino group [-N(CH₃)₂] must be at the remaining ortho position relative to the carboxylic acid, which is C2.\n\n4.  **Finalized Structure:** Based on this deductive process, we have the following arrangement of substituents (this is just one possible numbering for drawing, not the final IUPAC numbering):\n    *   **C1:** -COOH\n    *   **C2:** -N(CH₃)₂\n    *   **C3:** -CHO\n    *   **C4:** -OCH₃\n    *   **C5:** -CN\n    *   **C6:** -OH\n\n### 2. Determine the IUPAC Name\n\nNow, we apply the IUPAC rules of nomenclature to this specific structure.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:** We compare the priority of the functional groups present: Carboxylic acid > Nitrile > Aldehyde > Alcohol > Amine > Ether. The **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Number the Ring:**\n    *   The carbon atom attached to the principal functional group (-COOH) is assigned locant **C1**.\n    *   We must then number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible set of locants. We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1.\n    *   Let's check the locant sets for both directions, based on our derived structure:\n        *   **Numbering Clockwise:** Substituents are at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Set: {2,3,4,5,6}\n        *   **Numbering Counter-Clockwise:** The substituents would be -OH at C2, -CN at C3, -CHO at C4, -N(CH3)2 at C5, and -OCH3 at C6. But this does not match our structure. We must stick to the structure we derived. Let's re-state the substituents based on their actual positions on the ring relative to C1: C2 has -N(CH3)2, C3 has -CHO, C4 has -OCH3, C5 has -CN, and C6 has -OH.\n        *   **Numbering Counter-clockwise from C1:** C2 would have -OH, C3 would have -CN, C4 would have -OCH3, C5 would have -CHO, and C6 would have -N(CH3)2.\n    *   The locant set is **{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}** in both directions.\n\n3.  **Apply the Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the locant sets are identical, we give the lower number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n    *   First, let's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n        *   **c**yano (-CN)\n        *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n        *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n        *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n        *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n    *   The first substituent in the alphabetical list is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering direction that gives 'cyano' the lower number.\n        *   In the **clockwise** direction (C2=-N(CH₃)₂, C3=-CHO,...), the cyano group is at **C5**.\n        *   In the **counter-clockwise** direction (C2=-OH, C3=-CN,...), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the correct IUPAC numbering is **counter-clockwise**.\n\n4.  **Assign Final Locants and Assemble the Name:**\n    Using the correct counter-clockwise numbering, we get:\n    *   C1: -COOH (the parent acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (**2-hydroxy**)\n    *   C3: -CN (**3-cyano**)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (**4-methoxy**)\n    *   C5: -CHO (**5-formyl**)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (**6-(dimethylamino)**)\n\n    Now, assemble the full name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order before the parent name \"benzoic acid\":\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    This name perfectly matches option D.\n\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order)\n    *   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n    *   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Correct**)\n\n<<<D>>>"
