    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Vector Field\n\nThe problem describes a vector field `f(r)` with the following properties:\n*   Its magnitude is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the distance from the origin.\n*   Its direction is purely radial, pointing away from the origin.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, we can write this vector field as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n### 2. The Problem Statement\n\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∇ ⋅ f`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\nThe integral to be calculated is:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\n\n### 3. Choosing the Method: The Divergence Theorem\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses that volume.\n\nMathematically:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`, and `S` is its surface.\n\n**Important Note:** The Divergence Theorem requires the vector field to be well-behaved (continuously differentiable) everywhere inside the volume `V`. Our field `f(r) = r_hat / r^2` has a singularity at the origin (`r = 0`), where it is undefined. However, the theorem can still be used to find the answer by considering the flux through the boundary surface, which cleverly avoids the point of singularity. This is a standard technique for dealing with such problems, especially in contexts like electrostatics (e.g., Gauss's Law for a point charge).\n\n### 4. Applying the Divergence Theorem\n\nWe will calculate the right-hand side of the theorem: the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Surface `S`**: This is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n*   **Vector Field `f` on the surface**: At any point on the surface `S`, `r = R`. So the field is `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **Surface Element `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential surface element vector `dS` always points radially outward. Therefore, `dS = dS * r_hat`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the surface element area.\n*   **The Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**: We compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [dS * r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, this simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Integral\n\nNow we can substitute this back into the surface integral:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n\nSince `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, `1/R^2` is a constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n`= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\nThe integral `∮_S dS` simply means summing up all the differential surface areas over the entire surface of the sphere. This is, by definition, the total surface area of the sphere.\nThe surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\nSo, we have:\n`= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n\nThe `R^2` terms cancel out:\n`= 4π`\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nBy the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral (flux) we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThe result is a constant value, `4π`, independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`, so that the singularity at the origin is enclosed).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 1\nD) 4 π\n\nThe calculated answer matches option D.\n\n(Self-reflection: An attempt to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly would yield 0 for `r > 0`. This is misleading because it ignores the singularity at `r=0`. The divergence at the origin is actually a Dirac delta function, `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ^3(r)`. Integrating `4πδ^3(r)` over a volume containing the origin gives `4π`, confirming the result obtained using the Divergence Theorem.)\n\n<<<D>>>"
