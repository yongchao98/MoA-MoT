    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. We check for chiral centers and overall molecular symmetry.\n        *   There are no stereocenters (no carbon with four different single-bonded substituents).\n        *   However, chirality can also arise from the arrangement of groups around a double bond (planar chirality). The carbons of the double bond are C1 and C2.\n        *   Groups on C1: `Cl` and `H`. These are different.\n        *   Groups on C2: `-CH3` (methyl) and `-CH2CH3` (ethyl). These are different.\n        *   The molecule has the general structure `abC=Cde` where `a`≠`b` and `d`≠`e`. Let's draw the (Z)-isomer, where the high-priority groups on each carbon are on the same side. Priority(C1): `Cl` > `H`. Priority(C2): `-CH2CH3` > `-CH3`.\n            ```\n              Cl   CH2CH3\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n              H   CH3\n            ```\n        *   This molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The plane of the double bond is not a molecular plane of symmetry because of the constitution of the ethyl and methyl groups. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Since it is a specific stereoisomer ((Z)-isomer), it will be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active. **(1)**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS,E)`. These descriptors specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The parent structure (without the `8-(chloromethylene)` group) can be meso, but the addition of the `=CHCl` substituent breaks this symmetry. A molecule designated with specific R/S configurations is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound (unless it happens to be a meso compound, which is not the case here). A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active. **(2)**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check if this specific stereoisomer (`2R,3S`) is chiral or meso. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   Drawing the Fischer projection for the (2R, 3S) isomer reveals that it has a center of inversion (i), which makes it achiral. Alternatively, a staggered Newman projection or 3D model shows a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3 in the anti-conformation of the carboxyl groups. This is the definition of a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive (meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is another stereoisomer of the same molecule.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the `(R,R)` diastereomer. Unlike the `(R,S)` meso form, the `(R,R)` isomer and its mirror image, the `(S,S)` isomer, are not superimposable. The `(R,R)` isomer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is therefore chiral. As a single, specified enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active. **(3)**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at a stereocenter. This implies the molecule is chiral. Let's verify. Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-OH`, (2) `-H`, (3) `-CH2-CH=` (path towards C2), and (4) `-CH2-CH2-CH=` (path towards C6). Since the paths around the ring are different, C1 is indeed a stereocenter. The molecule as a whole is chiral. Since it's given as a single enantiomer `(R)`, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active. **(4)**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptors `(1s,3s,5s)` or the more common `cis` indicate that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all axial or all equatorial).\n    *   **Analysis:** This highly symmetric molecule is achiral. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (each plane containing one C-OH group and bisecting the opposite C-C bond). Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral (meso).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The IUPAC name describes a ketone. The parent chain is butan-1-one, with the carbonyl at C1. A cyclopentyl group is attached to C1, and a methyl group is on C3. The structure is `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. This is also known as cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone: `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Analysis:** We check for stereocenters. The carbon atom in the `CH(CH3)2` group is attached to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-` group, and two identical methyl groups (`-CH3`). Since it is attached to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter. There are no other stereocenters in the molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry in certain conformations, making it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Optically active:\n    1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    3. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    4. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n- Optically inactive:\n    * (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    * (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    * 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 4 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<A>>>"
