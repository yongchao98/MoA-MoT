    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have a neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. This means the net charge of the conductor is zero. Inside this conductor, there is a cavity.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive charge, $+q$, is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges (electrons) in the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the electric field inside the conductor must be zero. For the electric field to be zero, the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. This means the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity must be exactly equal and opposite to the charge placed inside. Therefore, a charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner wall of the cavity.\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor. These positive charges (which are essentially the atoms left behind by the migrated electrons) will repel each other and move as far apart as possible. They will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor. Thus, a charge of $+q$ is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges inside it. The conducting material between the cavity and the outer surface prevents the electric field from the charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$) from reaching the outside. The net electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced *only* by the charges on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The charge $+q$ on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge inside the cavity due to the shielding effect. This $+q$ charge will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to minimize electrostatic potential energy.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** According to the shell theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Therefore, the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P is the same as the field from a point charge $+q$ located at O. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    The information about the cavity's radius ($r$), its displacement from the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to the point P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all distractors, as they do not affect the electric field *outside* the conducting sphere.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. Ignores the conductor's shielding.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct. Matches our derivation.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. This would be the field from a charge at the cavity's center without the conductor.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. Ignores the conductor's shielding.\n\n<<<B>>>"
