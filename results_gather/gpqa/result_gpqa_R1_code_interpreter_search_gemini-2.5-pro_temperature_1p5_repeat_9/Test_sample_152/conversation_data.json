    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate (`CH2(COOCH3)2`). The α-carbon is flanked by two ester groups, making its protons acidic. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), will deprotonate this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate), which is a potent nucleophile.\n        `CH2(COOCH3)2 + NaOEt <=> Na+[-CH(COOCH3)2] + EtOH`\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH3`). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon bonded to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (1,4-Conjugate Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion from dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π-electrons from the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming an enolate intermediate.\n    *   This enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure:**\n    *   A new single bond is formed between the α-carbon of the dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the methyl acrylate.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the acrylate is saturated in the process.\n    *   The structure is: `(CH3OOC)2CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):**\n    *   To name this molecule according to the options, we identify the longest carbon chain that can be considered a backbone. Let's consider a three-carbon (propane) backbone.\n    *   If we number the carbons as `C1-C2-C3` where `C1` is the `CH` from the malonate, `C2` is the `CH` from the acrylate, and `C3` is the `CH2` from the acrylate, the structure looks like this: `(CH3OOC)2-C1H - C2H(p-tolyl) - C3H2-COOCH3`.\n    *   This molecule is a tricarboxylate. There are two methyl carboxylate (`-COOCH3`) groups on C1 and one on C3. There is a p-tolyl group on C2.\n    *   Therefore, the systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at their β-carbon.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`), also known as crotononitrile, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an intermediate containing an iminium ion (from the enamine part) and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion, which is quickly protonated.\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (`H3O+`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (a ketone).\n\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The piperidine is removed, and the C1 of the cyclohexane ring becomes a ketone (C=O).\n    *   The `(E)-but-2-enenitrile` moiety becomes a `CH(CH3)-CH2-CN` group attached to the α-carbon (C2) of the newly formed cyclohexanone.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position with a 3-cyanobutyl group.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The product is a butanenitrile derivative. The parent chain is `butanenitrile`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on this chain. It is attached at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The substituent name is (2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Thus, the name of product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative option, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol form, which is typically the minor tautomer compared to the more stable keto form under these conditions.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to find one of the starting materials. This requires a retrosynthetic analysis.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This means a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring has a `-(CH2)2-CO-CH3` (3-oxobutyl) group at position C2.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** But-3-en-2-one (`CH2=CH-CO-CH3`), also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).\n\n3.  **Perform Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   In a Michael addition, the new C-C bond forms between the β-carbon of the acceptor and the α-carbon of the donor.\n    *   The acceptor (MVK) is `CH2(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH3`. The `(3-oxobutyl)` side chain in the product corresponds to this molecule after the reaction. The bond to the donor is at the `CH2` (former β-carbon).\n    *   The donor's nucleophilic carbon is the C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring, which is acidic.\n    *   To find reactant C, we break the bond between C2 of the ring and the side chain.\n    *   Breaking this bond gives us the enolate of C and the acceptor. Adding a proton to the enolate reveals the identity of the Michael donor, C.\n    *   Therefore, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Forward Reaction:**\n    *   Cyclohexane-1,3-dione has a highly acidic methylene group at C2 (pKa ≈ 5).\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates C2 to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    *   This enolate attacks the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one.\n    *   Protonation of the resulting intermediate yields the given product. The mechanism is consistent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nComparing this with the given options, we find that option B contains all the correct assignments.\n\n<<<B>>>"
