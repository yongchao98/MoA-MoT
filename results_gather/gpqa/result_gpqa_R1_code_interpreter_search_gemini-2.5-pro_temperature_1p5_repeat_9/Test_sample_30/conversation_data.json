    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically nitration. Toluene has a methyl group (-CH3) on a benzene ring. The methyl group is an activating group and an *ortho-, para-* director. This means the incoming nitro group (-NO2) will be directed to the positions ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) to the methyl group.\n*   Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the *para* product is generally favored and is the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** para-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n    ```\n        CH3\n         |\n      /-----\\\n     |       |\n     |       |\n      \\-----/\n         |\n        NO2\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** MnO2 in an acidic medium is an oxidizing agent. In organic chemistry, it is known for selectively oxidizing benzylic or allylic alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. While stronger oxidizing agents like KMnO4 are typically used to oxidize a benzylic methyl group to a carboxylic acid, MnO2 can oxidize activated methyl groups (like the one in p-nitrotoluene) to the corresponding aldehyde, especially when a subsequent reaction points to the presence of an aldehyde functional group. The formation of the carboxylic acid (p-nitrobenzoic acid) is also possible under harsher conditions, but the aldehyde is more consistent with the next reaction step.\n*   **Product 2:** p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde). The methyl group (-CH3) is oxidized to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n    ```\n        CHO\n         |\n      /-----\\\n     |       |\n     |       |\n      \\-----/\n         |\n        NO2\n    ```\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH3)2C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, known as the **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**. The base (NaOH) removes an acidic α-proton from acetone to form an enolate ion, which acts as a nucleophile. P-nitrobenzaldehyde does not have any α-protons and its carbonyl carbon is highly electrophilic, so it acts as the electrophile.\n    1.  The acetone enolate attacks the aldehyde carbonyl group.\n    2.  The resulting aldol addition product quickly dehydrates (loses a molecule of water) because the resulting double bond is in conjugation with both the aromatic ring and the ketone's carbonyl group, which leads to a very stable system.\n*   The reaction is:\n    p-NO2-C6H4-CHO + CH3-CO-CH3  ---(NaOH/H2O)---> p-NO2-C6H4-CH=CH-CO-CH3 + H2O\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The trans (E) isomer is the major product due to lower steric hindrance.\n\n    ```\n                      H   H   O\n                       \\ /   //\n    O2N --- [Benzene Ring] --- C = C - C - CH3\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Molecule:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** To find the point group, we look for symmetry elements (rotation axes, mirror planes, center of inversion, etc.).\n    *   For maximum stability due to conjugation, the molecule will adopt a largely planar conformation. The benzene ring, the nitro group (-NO2), the vinyl group (-CH=CH-), and the carbonyl group (-CO-) all lie in the same plane.\n    *   **Rotation Axes (Cn):** There are no rotation axes (other than the trivial C1 axis). A C2 axis passing through the center of the ring, for example, is not present because the substituents on the ring are different (a nitro group vs. the butenone side chain).\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not possess a center of inversion. Inverting the oxygen atoms of the nitro group through the molecular center does not lead to equivalent atoms.\n    *   **Mirror Plane (σ):** If we consider the plane that contains the benzene ring and the C=C-C=O backbone, this plane bisects the molecule. Even considering the 3D nature of the methyl group (-CH3), it is possible to orient it such that one of its C-H bonds is in this plane, and the other two hydrogens are positioned symmetrically above and below the plane. In this conformation, the molecular plane acts as a mirror plane (σ).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses only two symmetry elements: the identity element (E) and a single mirror plane (σ). A molecule with only these two elements belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) C3: Requires a three-fold axis of rotation.\nB) Cs: Requires a single plane of symmetry. This matches our finding.\nC) C2h: Requires a C2 axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and a center of inversion.\nD) D2h: A high symmetry group with multiple C2 axes and mirror planes.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
