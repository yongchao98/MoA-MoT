    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5. A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (DBE=4) and one additional double bond or ring (DBE=1), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Data:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n=2, n+1=3 peaks), indicating a -CH2-CHO group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) multiplicity means these two protons are coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1, n+1=2 peaks), which is the aldehyde proton. The chemical shift is consistent with a benzylic CH2 group that is also alpha to a carbonyl. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The upfield shifts (especially 6.51 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the aromatic signals.\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have the following fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), an amine group (-NH2), and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO). Assembling these fragments gives the structure 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal (also known as p-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) -> C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n    The starting material is:\n     ![Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/L1d4g0E.png)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is the standard diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The aldehyde group remains unchanged.\n    The product is 2-(4-diazoniophenyl)ethanal chloride.\n    [Cl-][N2+]-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O, Heat**\n    Heating an aqueous solution of an aromatic diazonium salt results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, liberating nitrogen gas (N2). This is a standard method for synthesizing phenols.\n    The product after this step is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (or p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n    HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves treating the product from step 2, p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound has acidic α-hydrogens (the H's on the -CH2- group) and an aldehyde functional group. These are the classic conditions for a self-aldol condensation.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-hydrogen to form a resonance-stabilized enolate. The acidic phenolic proton is also removed to form a phenoxide.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of another molecule of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond and, after protonation (from water), yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol addition product. The structure of this adduct is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This is option D).\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with \"Heat\". This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. The acidic α-hydrogen (on C2) and the β-hydroxyl group (on C3) are removed. This dehydration is highly favorable as it results in the formation of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new C=C double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group and one of the phenyl rings, leading to a highly stable system.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\nLet's visualize the aldol condensation:\nReactant: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\nAldol Adduct (Option D):\n```\n      CHO        OH\n      |          |\n  HO-Ph-CH --- CH --- CH2-Ph-OH\n```\nThis is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n\nDehydration (due to heat):\nElimination of H2O (the blue H from C2 and OH from C3) gives the final condensation product:\n```\n      CHO\n      |\n  HO-Ph-C==CH---CH2-Ph-OH\n```\nThe IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option C.\n\nGiven that the reaction is performed with heating, the reaction will proceed to the most stable product, which is the dehydrated condensation product. The aldol addition product (Option D) is an intermediate.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\nFinal check of options:\nA) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect molecular formula and structure.\nB) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure, missing the hydroxyl groups.\nC) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This is the correct structure and name for the aldol condensation product.\nD) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating.\n\n<<<C>>>"
