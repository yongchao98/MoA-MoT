    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration forms an anhydride.\n    *   **NMR of Anhydride:**\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak means all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl).\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n    *   These spectral data perfectly match **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making its two vinylic protons equivalent (a singlet at ~7.0-7.3 ppm) and its two carbonyl carbons equivalent (~165 ppm) and its two vinylic carbons equivalent (~137 ppm).\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4) and methyl groups attached to each of these four carbons. The fifth carbon (C5) is a -CH₂- group.\n\n2.  **The Reaction: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** derivative.\n    *   The reaction produces two stereoisomers: the **endo** and **exo** products. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry: Endo vs. Exo Selectivity**\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Typically, Diels-Alder reactions favor the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. This would make the *endo* product the major kinetic product.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** However, the diene used here is extremely bulky. It has four methyl groups on the reacting carbon atoms (C1, C2, C3, C4). This significant steric hindrance can override the electronic preference for the *endo* transition state, making the less hindered *exo* pathway faster.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific case, it is very likely that the **exo product is the major product** (kinetic control) and the **endo product is the minor product**.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Products and NOESY Analysis**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows a cross-peak between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor).\n    *   Let's analyze the proton signals and their positions in the two isomers.\n        *   **Product Protons:**\n            *   **Vinylic methyls (Me_vinyl):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the newly formed C=C bond. (6H singlet). Expected shift ~1.7 ppm.\n            *   **Bridgehead methyls (Me_bridgehead):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. (6H singlet). Expected shift ~1.0-1.5 ppm.\n            *   **Anhydride protons (H_anhydride):** Two equivalent protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride. They are alpha to carbonyls. (2H singlet). Expected shift ~3.0-4.0 ppm.\n            *   **Methylene bridge protons:** Two protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Spatial Proximity in Isomers:**\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Major):** In the *exo* structure, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C7 bridge. This places its two protons (**H_anhydride**) on the *endo* face of the molecule, pointing \"underneath\" the C=C double bond. This brings them very close to the **vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl)**. A strong NOE is expected between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl**.\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Minor):** In the *endo* structure, the anhydride ring points towards the C7 bridge. This places its two protons (**H_anhydride**) on the *exo* face, pointing \"away\" from the C=C double bond and its methyl groups. They are far apart. The NOE between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** would be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major product (exo) but absent in the minor product (endo) must be between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n    *   Let's match these protons to the options provided:\n        *   **Anhydride protons (H_anhydride):** A 2H singlet at a downfield shift, ~3.5 ppm is a very reasonable assignment.\n        *   **Vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinyl):** A 6H singlet around ~1.7 ppm is a very reasonable assignment.\n    *   Now we check the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> Incorrect protons/multiplicity.\n        *   B) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** -> This perfectly matches our prediction for the NOE between Me_vinyl and H_anhydride in the major (exo) product.\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Incorrect protons/multiplicity.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> This would be an NOE between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. This interaction would likely exist in both isomers and is not the key distinguishing feature.\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
