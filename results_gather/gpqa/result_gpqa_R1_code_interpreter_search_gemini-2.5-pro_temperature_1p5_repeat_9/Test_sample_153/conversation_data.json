    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has a relative abundance of 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 intensity ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1) is a characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**. (Natural abundance: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. The molecular formula that fits this is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Calculation: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35.5, avg) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   With ³⁵Cl: 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   With ³⁷Cl: 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158.\n    This confirms the molecular formula and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a classic, very distinctive peak for the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the characteristic range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Given the O-H peak, this corresponds to the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal far downfield, between 10-13 ppm, is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**). It is a singlet because it typically does not couple with other protons due to rapid chemical exchange. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 4H (2H + 2H), indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The splitting pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para structure makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent equivalent. They split each other into two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule contains a benzene ring with two different substituents arranged in a para (1,4) configuration. One of those substituents is the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### 4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options\n\n*   **From MS:** We know the molecule is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **From IR and NMR:** We know it contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **From NMR:** We know the substituents are on a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThe pieces are: a benzene ring, a -COOH group, and a -Cl atom. Arranging them in a para configuration gives the structure **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. It is an acyl chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H IR peak and the ¹H NMR signal at 11 ppm.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Perfect match.** It has the correct formula (C₇H₅ClO₂), the carboxylic acid functional group (explains IR and the 11 ppm NMR signal), and the para-substitution pattern (explains the two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR).\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. This is ortho-substituted. The four aromatic protons would not be symmetrical and would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR, not two clean doublets of 2H each.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would show an aldehyde proton signal (~9-10 ppm) instead of a carboxylic acid proton, and it has a phenolic -OH, not a carboxylic acid -OH.\n\nThe combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
