    "An analysis of the options provided:\n\n1.  **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum field theory describing how light and matter interact. When calculating physical quantities, especially those involving virtual particles in \"loops,\" the integrals often diverge at high energies (short distances). This is known as an ultraviolet (UV) divergence. To handle these infinities, a procedure called **regularization** is employed, which introduces a cutoff to make the integrals finite. This is followed by renormalization to absorb the infinities into the definition of physical constants. Therefore, QED requires regularization.\n\n2.  **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, also encounters infinities. The most famous example is the self-energy of a point-like charge (like an electron). If you calculate the energy contained in the electric field of a point charge, the integral diverges as you get closer to the point. This is effectively a high-energy problem. To get a finite answer, one must \"regularize\" the theory, for instance, by assuming the charge is not a true point but is spread over a tiny, non-zero radius. Thus, classical electrodynamics also requires a form of regularization to deal with the concept of point charges.\n\n3.  **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force, which binds quarks and gluons to form protons and neutrons. Similar to QED, QCD is a quantum field theory where calculations of interaction processes lead to UV divergences in loop diagrams. Consequently, QCD also necessitates the use of regularization and renormalization techniques.\n\n4.  **D) Superstring Theory:** This theory is a candidate for a \"theory of everything.\" It replaces the idea of fundamental point-like particles with one-dimensional, vibrating \"strings.\" A key feature and major motivation for string theory is that it appears to be free from the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that plague quantum field theories. The finite size of the strings \"smears out\" the interactions at very short distances, which prevents the integrals in calculations from diverging. This intrinsic property means that superstring theory is considered \"UV finite\" and does not need the ad-hoc procedure of regularization.\n\nBased on this analysis, Superstring Theory is the one that is believed not to require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
