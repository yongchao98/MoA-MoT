    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 1/7 (which is approximately 14.2857%).\n    *   Let's check the general formulas for hydrocarbons to see which one gives a hydrogen mass fraction of 1/7. We can use integer atomic masses for this (C=12, H=1).\n        *   Alkanes (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). This is not equal to 1/7.\n        *   Alkenes/Cycloalkanes (CnH2n): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7. This matches.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. This rules out it being an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Let's check the mass fraction for C6H12: Mass % H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / (72 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (C + D) gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means hydrogenation of C must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, C cannot be an alkene or alkyne. It could be a saturated compound or an aromatic one.\n        *   If C is a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), its hydrogenation under severe conditions would break the ring and form acyclic alkanes (like hexane), not cyclohexane.\n        *   This leaves the possibility that C is an aromatic compound. Benzene (C6H6) does not decolorize bromine water (without a catalyst) and its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12).\n    *   This fits all the criteria. Therefore, **mixture Y consists of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n3.  **Identify the components of Mixture X and the reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n        *   Reaction: A + B → C + D\n        *   Substituting the known components of Y: **A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)**\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. All molecules involved must have the same carbon skeleton, because hydrogenation of both A and B results in cyclohexane. This means A and B are C6 hydrocarbons.\n    *   Let A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy. By balancing the hydrogen atoms in the reaction:\n        *   x + y = 6 (from benzene) + 12 (from cyclohexane)\n        *   **x + y = 18**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is precisely the sum x + y.\n\n4.  **Verify the properties of Mixture X.**\n    *   We have determined that the total number of hydrogen atoms in molecules A and B is 18. Let's find what A and B are to ensure consistency with the remaining conditions.\n    *   Condition: Mixture X decolorizes bromine water. This means A and/or B must contain C=C double bonds (i.e., they are unsaturated). Their formulas must be C6Hx where x < 12.\n    *   Condition: There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n    *   Let's find a pair of C6-ring based unsaturated hydrocarbons (that hydrogenate to cyclohexane) such that the sum of their hydrogens is 18. The candidates are:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) (non-conjugated)\n        *   (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is C6H8 but is conjugated, so it is ruled out).\n    *   Let's test the pair {Cyclohexene, Cyclohexa-1,4-diene}:\n        *   Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n        *   Number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n        *   The disproportionation reaction would be:\n            C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n            This is a chemically plausible hydrogen transfer. The diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the mono-ene gains 2H to become cyclohexane.\n        *   All other conditions are satisfied by this choice of A and B.\n\n5.  **Final Answer.**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
