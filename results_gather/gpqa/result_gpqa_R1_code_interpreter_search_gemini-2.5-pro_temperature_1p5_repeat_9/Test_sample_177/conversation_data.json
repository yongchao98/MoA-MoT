    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ in the given interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$ and whether this implies the theory is renormalizable.\n\n2.  **Principle of Dimensional Analysis in Quantum Field Theory (QFT):**\n    *   In natural units, where the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to 1 ($\\hbar = c = 1$), mass, energy, and momentum all have the same dimension, which we will denote as mass dimension $[M]$. Length and time have an inverse mass dimension, $[L] = [T] = -1$.\n    *   The action, $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$, is a dimensionless quantity in these units.\n    *   The four-dimensional spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of $[d^4x]_M = [L^4]_M = -4$.\n    *   For the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of +4. So, $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$.\n    *   This means every term in the total Lagrangian, including our interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$, must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n3.  **Determine the Mass Dimension of Each Component in $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$:**\n    *   **Fermion Field ($\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$):** The mass dimension of the fermion field is determined from its kinetic term in the Dirac Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{Dirac} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. The kinetic part is $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have:\n        $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\gamma^\\mu]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M + [\\psi]_M = 4$.\n        The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless constants, so $[\\gamma^\\mu]_M = 0$.\n        The derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has a mass dimension of +1, since $[x^\\mu]_M = -1$.\n        The dimensions of $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$ are the same: $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M$.\n        So, $2[\\psi]_M + 0 + 1 = 4$.\n        This gives $2[\\psi]_M = 3$, which means $[\\psi]_M = 3/2$.\n\n    *   **Field Strength Tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$):** The mass dimension of the electromagnetic field strength tensor is determined from its kinetic term in the Maxwell Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{Maxwell} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have:\n        $[F_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n        $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n        This gives $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n\n    *   **Sigma Tensor ($\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$):** This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$. Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless. Thus, $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mass Dimension of $\\kappa$:**\n    *   Now we use the fact that the interaction term must have a mass dimension of 4:\n        $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n    *   We can write this as the sum of the dimensions of each part:\n        $[\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n    *   Substitute the dimensions we found:\n        $[\\kappa]_M + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4$.\n    *   Simplify the equation:\n        $[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4$.\n        $[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4$.\n    *   Solve for $[\\kappa]_M$:\n        $[\\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1$.\n\n5.  **Determine Renormalizability:**\n    *   In QFT, the renormalizability of a theory is related to the mass dimension of its coupling constants. This is known as power-counting renormalizability.\n    *   **Renormalizable Theory:** All coupling constants have a non-negative mass dimension ($[g]_M \\ge 0$). These are called 'relevant' or 'marginal' operators.\n    *   **Non-Renormalizable Theory:** The theory contains at least one coupling constant with a negative mass dimension ($[g]_M < 0$). These are called 'irrelevant' operators.\n    *   In our case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1.\n    *   A negative mass dimension means that as we go to higher orders in perturbation theory (i.e., consider loop diagrams with higher momentum), the divergences become progressively worse. To cancel these new types of divergences, an infinite number of counterterms would be required, rendering the theory non-renormalizable in the traditional sense. Such theories are typically treated as effective field theories, valid only up to a certain energy scale.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n    *   Because the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable.\n    *   This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
