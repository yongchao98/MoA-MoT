    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**1. Analyze the Potential**\n\nThe potential energy of the particle is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often helpful to express the potential in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nUsing these relationships, we can convert the terms in the potential:\n*   The first term is: `1/2 kr^2 = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2)`\n*   For the second term, we can identify `r^2 cos^2(θ)` as `(r cos(θ))^2`, which is simply `x^2`. So, the second term is: `3/2 kx^2`\n\nNow, substitute these back into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\nCombine the terms with x^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n**2. Separate the Schrödinger Equation**\n\nThe potential V(x, y) is now expressed as a sum of two independent terms, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis form corresponds to a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into two one-dimensional equations. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from the x and y motions, E = E_x + E_y.\n\nThe standard form for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential is `V(q) = 1/2 mω^2 q^2`, and its energy eigenvalues are `E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω`.\n\n**3. Solve for the x-direction**\n\nThe potential in the x-direction is `V_x(x) = 2kx^2`. We compare this to the standard form `1/2 m(ω_x)^2 x^2`:\n1/2 m(ω_x)^2 = 2k\nm(ω_x)^2 = 4k\n(ω_x)^2 = 4k/m\nω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the motion in the x-direction are:\nE_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n\n**4. Solve for the y-direction**\n\nThe potential in the y-direction is `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`. We compare this to the standard form `1/2 m(ω_y)^2 y^2`:\n1/2 m(ω_y)^2 = 1/2 k\nm(ω_y)^2 = k\nω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the motion in the y-direction are:\nE_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**5. Find the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of E_x and E_y:\nE = E_x + E_y\nE = (n_x + 1/2) * 2ℏ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term `ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`:\nE = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\nDistribute the 2 in the first term:\nE = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\nCombine the constant terms inside the bracket:\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nHere, `n_x` and `n_y` are non-negative integer quantum numbers (n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the given choices:\nA) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nD) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nOur derived energy spectrum, E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m), matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
