    "Here is my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I first identify all the given information and what needs to be calculated.\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Radius of Star 1 ($R_1$) = 1.5 × Radius of Star 2 ($R_2$)  => $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$\n        *   Mass of Star 1 ($M_1$) = 1.5 × Mass of Star 2 ($M_2$)\n        *   The peak brightness wavelength is the *same* for both stars. This refers to the *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,obs}$). So, $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$.\n        *   Radial velocity of Star 1 ($v_1$) = 0 km/s.\n        *   Radial velocity of Star 2 ($v_2$) = 700 km/s.\n    *   **To find:** The ratio of the luminosities, $L_1/L_2$.\n    *   **Assumption:** The stars radiate as black bodies.\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Luminosity of a Black Body:** The luminosity (L) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Peak Wavelength and Temperature:** The temperature (T) of a black body is related to its *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,em}$) by Wien's Displacement Law: $\\lambda_{max,em} = b/T$, where b is Wien's constant. This means $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{max,em}$.\n    *   **Doppler Shift:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is different from the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) if there is a relative radial velocity (v) between the source and the observer. The relativistic Doppler effect formula for light is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}}$, where c is the speed of light. A positive velocity (v > 0) indicates the object is receding (redshift), and a negative velocity (v < 0) indicates it is approaching (blueshift).\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   Step 1: Write down the expression for the luminosity ratio $L_1/L_2$ using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    *   Step 2: Use the given radius ratio to find the $(R_1/R_2)^2$ term.\n    *   Step 3: Determine the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$. This is the trickiest part. I need to relate the temperatures to the peak wavelengths using Wien's law, and then relate the emitted wavelengths to the observed wavelengths using the Doppler shift formula.\n    *   Step 4: Combine everything to calculate the final luminosity ratio $L_1/L_2$.\n\n4.  **Execute the Plan:**\n    *   **Step 1: Luminosity Ratio**\n        From the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n        $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n    *   **Step 2: Radius Term**\n        We are given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n        So, $\\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Temperature Ratio**\n        *   From Wien's Law, temperature is related to the *emitted* peak wavelength: $T_1 = b/\\lambda_{max,em,1}$ and $T_2 = b/\\lambda_{max,em,2}$.\n        *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{b/\\lambda_{max,em,1}}{b/\\lambda_{max,em,2}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{max,em,2}}{\\lambda_{max,em,1}}$.\n        *   Now, I need to find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths. I know the *observed* wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$.\n        *   For Star 1, $v_1 = 0$, so there is no Doppler shift. $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,em,1}$.\n        *   For Star 2, $v_2 = 700$ km/s. It is receding, so its light is redshifted. Using the Doppler formula: $\\lambda_{max,obs,2} = \\lambda_{max,em,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v_2}{c-v_2}}$.\n        *   Since $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$, we have: $\\lambda_{max,em,1} = \\lambda_{max,em,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v_2}{c-v_2}}$.\n        *   Rearranging to find the required ratio: $\\frac{\\lambda_{max,em,2}}{\\lambda_{max,em,1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{c+v_2}{c-v_2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v_2}{c+v_2}}$.\n        *   So, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v_2}{c+v_2}}$.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Final Calculation**\n        *   Substitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n            $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(1.5\\right)^2 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{c-v_2}{c+v_2}}\\right)^4$\n        *   Simplify the temperature term: $\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{c-v_2}{c+v_2}}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{c-v_2}{c+v_2}\\right)^2$.\n        *   The final expression is: $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{c-v_2}{c+v_2}\\right)^2$.\n        *   The information about the mass is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n        *   Now, I will use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants and Given Values\nR_ratio = 1.5  # R1/R2\nv2 = 700.0      # Radial velocity of Star 2 in km/s\nc = 299792.458  # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# The ratio of luminosities is given by L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# The temperature ratio T1/T2 is related to the doppler shift of Star 2.\n# T1/T2 = lambda_em,2 / lambda_em,1 = sqrt((c - v2)/(c + v2))\n# Therefore, (T1/T2)^4 = ((c - v2)/(c + v2))^2\n\n# Calculate beta (v2/c)\nbeta = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\nluminosity_ratio = (R_ratio**2) * ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.229158309328221\n</execute_result>\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   The Python code executed my derived formula.\n    *   The result is approximately 2.22916.\n    *   Comparing this to the given options:\n        A) ~2.32\n        B) ~2.25\n        C) ~2.23\n        D) ~2.35\n    *   The calculated value 2.22916 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star that radiates as a perfect black body is given by the formula:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $R$ is the radius of the star.\n    *   $T$ is the surface temperature of the star.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars as:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Radius Information:** The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so the ratio $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$. We can substitute this into our equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):** This requires combining Wien's Displacement Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature ($T$) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation ($\\lambda_{em}$): $T = b/\\lambda_{em}$, where $b$ is Wien's constant. From this, we can say that the temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the ratio of their emitted peak wavelengths:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{b/\\lambda_{em,1}}{b/\\lambda_{em,2}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{em,2}}{\\lambda_{em,1}}$\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$). We must relate these observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths using the stars' radial velocities.\n        *   For Star_1, the radial velocity $v_1 = 0$. Therefore, there is no Doppler shift, and its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n        *   For Star_2, the radial velocity $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its light is redshifted. The relativistic Doppler shift formula relates observed and emitted wavelengths:\n            $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}}$ (where v is the recession velocity).\n            So, for Star_2: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v_2}{c-v_2}}$.\n    *   **Connecting the pieces:** Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can set their expressions equal:\n        $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v_2}{c-v_2}}$\n    *   Now, we rearrange this to find the ratio we need for the temperature calculation, $\\lambda_{em,2}/\\lambda_{em,1}$:\n        $\\frac{\\lambda_{em,2}}{\\lambda_{em,1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{c+v_2}{c-v_2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v_2}{c+v_2}}$\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v_2}{c+v_2}}$\n\n6.  **Combine Everything for the Final Calculation:** Substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{c-v_2}{c+v_2}}\\right)^4$\n    Simplifying the exponent gives:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{c-v_2}{c+v_2}\\right)^2$\n\n7.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** Now we can plug in the values and calculate the result. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nI will use Python to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Values given in the problem\n# Ratio of the radii, R1/R2\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nv2 = 700.0\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc = 299792.458\n\n# The ratio of luminosities is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# From Doppler shift and Wien's law, we found (T1/T2)^4 = ((c - v2)/(c + v2))^2\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) * ((c - v2) / (c + v2))**2\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.22908325509156\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.
