    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Relationship between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity**\n\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The formula for the Doppler shift is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\n    where $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the change in wavelength, $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength, $v_r$ is the star's radial velocity (its velocity along our line of sight), and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The maximum observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K_{star}$.\n    $$ K_{star} = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} $$\n    Since the problem states that the *same spectral line* is observed for both stars, $\\lambda_0$ is the same for both systems. Therefore, the RV semi-amplitude $K_{star}$ is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    $$ K_{star} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max} $$\n    We are given the wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n\n    For a star in a circular orbit around the system's center of mass (due to an orbiting planet), the RV semi-amplitude $K_{star}$ is given by (assuming we are viewing the orbit edge-on, i.e., inclination $i=90^\\circ$, for maximum effect):\n    $$ K_{star} = \\frac{2\\pi M_p a}{M_s P} $$\n    where:\n    *   $M_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_s$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit around the star.\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law**\n\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period ($P$) to the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $$ P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_s + M_p)} a^3 $$\n    The problem states that the stars have masses similar to the Sun and the planets have masses similar to Neptune. Since the Sun's mass is much greater than Neptune's ($M_s \\gg M_p$), we can approximate $M_s + M_p \\approx M_s$.\n    $$ P^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_s} a^3 $$\n    We can rearrange this to express the semi-major axis $a$ in terms of the period $P$:\n    $$ a^3 \\approx \\frac{G M_s P^2}{4\\pi^2} $$\n    $$ a \\approx \\left(\\frac{G M_s}{4\\pi^2}\\right)^{1/3} P^{2/3} $$\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations to Find the K-P Relationship**\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for $a$ from step 3 into the equation for $K_{star}$ from step 2:\n    $$ K_{star} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi M_p}{M_s P} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{G M_s}{4\\pi^2}\\right)^{1/3} P^{2/3} \\right] $$\n    Let's group the constant terms and the terms involving $P$:\n    $$ K_{star} \\approx \\left[ \\frac{2\\pi M_p}{M_s} \\left(\\frac{G M_s}{4\\pi^2}\\right)^{1/3} \\right] \\times \\frac{P^{2/3}}{P} $$\n    $$ K_{star} \\approx (\\text{Constant}) \\times P^{-1/3} $$\n    The problem states that the masses of the two stars are the same ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$) and the masses of the two planets are the same ($M_{p1} = M_{p2}$). Therefore, the entire term in the square brackets is a constant for both systems. This leaves us with a simple proportionality:\n    $$ K_{star} \\propto P^{-1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n\n    Using the proportionality from step 4, we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    From step 1, we know that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$. So:\n    $$ \\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\n    $$ \\frac{343}{125} = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is $P_2/P_1$. We take the reciprocal:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n    Now, let's compute the decimal value.\n    ```python\n    print(125 / 343)\n    ```\n    <execute_result>\n    0.3644314868804665\n    </execute_result>\n    The result is approximately 0.36.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
