    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Physical Setup**\n\nWe have a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. This means its electrical potential is fixed at zero (`V=0`). A point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`.\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will polarize the sphere, inducing surface charges on it. These induced charges will create their own electric field. The net potential energy of the system is the energy stored in the total electric field, which is equivalent to the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position at `d`.\n\n### **2. Apply the Method of Images**\n\nThis problem is elegantly solved using the \"method of images\". The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be perfectly replicated by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" placed *inside* the sphere.\n\nLet's find the magnitude (`q'`) and position (`b` from the center) of this image charge. The key condition is that the sum of the potentials from the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must be zero everywhere on the surface of the sphere (since it's grounded).\n\nLet's place the center of the sphere at the origin and the charge `q` on the x-axis at `x=d`. The image charge `q'` will also be on the x-axis at `x=b`.\n\nThe potential at any point `P` on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) must be zero.\nPotential due to `q`: `V_q = kq / r_1`\nPotential due to `q'`: `V_{q'} = kq' / r_2`\n\nwhere `r_1` is the distance from `q` to `P` and `r_2` is the distance from `q'` to `P`.\n\nBy solving the equation `V_q + V_{q'} = 0` for all points on the surface, we find the following for the image charge:\n\n*   **Position of image charge (`b`):** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge (`q'`):** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nSo, the complex system of the point charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to a simpler system of two point charges: the original charge `q` at `d` and an image charge `q' = -q(R/d)` at `b = R^2/d`. This equivalence is valid for calculating the field and potential *outside* the sphere.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the sphere's center. This work is done against the force exerted by the sphere (i.e., by the induced charges). This force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nA more direct way to calculate the potential energy (`U`) of the interaction is using the formula:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nWhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` that is created by all *other* charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charges are not fixed; their distribution changes as `q` is brought in from infinity.\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at distance `d` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\n1.  **Calculate the distance between `q` and `q'`:**\n    The distance is `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential `V_induced` at `d`:**\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the total potential energy `U`:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### **4. Final Answer Check**\n\nThe derived expression for the potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nLet's compare this with the given options:\n\nA) `U = - kq^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nC) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\nD) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n\nOur result perfectly matches option B. The negative sign is physically correct, indicating that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive, and the system's energy is lower than when the charge is at infinity (U=0).\n\n<<<B>>>"
