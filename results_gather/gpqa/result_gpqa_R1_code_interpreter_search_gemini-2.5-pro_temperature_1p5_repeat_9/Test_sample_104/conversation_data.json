    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core of the problem is to equate two different physical phenomena that cause a dip in a star's observed brightness:\n*   **Scenario 1: Starspots.** A cooler, darker region on the star's surface rotates into view, reducing the total light output.\n*   **Scenario 2: Exoplanet Transit.** A planet passes in front of the star, blocking a fraction of its light.\n\nWe need to find the size of an exoplanet ($R_{pl}$) relative to its star ($R_{star}$) that would produce the same brightness dip (amplitude) as the given starspot configuration.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starspot Scenario**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. The brightness of a star (or a part of it) is proportional to its flux, which is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: $F = \\sigma T^4$, where $F$ is the flux (energy per unit area per second), $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness ($B_{max}$):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk of the star has a temperature of $T_{eff} = 6000$ K. The total flux is proportional to $A_{disk} \\cdot \\sigma T_{eff}^4$, where $A_{disk}$ is the area of the star's visible disk.\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness ($B_{min}$):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere is facing the observer. The problem states a filling factor of 20% (or $f = 0.20$). This means 20% of the visible disk is covered by spots, and the remaining 80% is the normal photosphere.\n    *   Temperature of spots: $T_{spot} = T_{eff} - 1000K = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K$.\n    *   The flux from the spot-covered area is proportional to $(f \\cdot A_{disk}) \\cdot \\sigma T_{spot}^4$.\n    *   The flux from the unspotted area is proportional to $((1-f) \\cdot A_{disk}) \\cdot \\sigma T_{eff}^4$.\n    *   The total minimum brightness is the sum: $B_{min} \\propto (f \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot \\sigma T_{spot}^4) + ((1-f) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot \\sigma T_{eff}^4)$.\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation:** The fractional dip in brightness is given by $\\frac{B_{max} - B_{min}}{B_{max}}$.\n    \n    Amplitude = $ \\frac{A_{disk} \\sigma T_{eff}^4 - [ (f \\cdot A_{disk} \\sigma T_{spot}^4) + ((1-f) \\cdot A_{disk} \\sigma T_{eff}^4) ]}{A_{disk} \\sigma T_{eff}^4} $\n\n    We can cancel out the common terms $A_{disk}$ and $\\sigma$:\n\n    Amplitude = $ \\frac{T_{eff}^4 - (f \\cdot T_{spot}^4 + (1-f) \\cdot T_{eff}^4)}{T_{eff}^4} $\n    Amplitude = $ \\frac{T_{eff}^4 - f \\cdot T_{spot}^4 - T_{eff}^4 + f \\cdot T_{eff}^4}{T_{eff}^4} $\n    Amplitude = $ \\frac{f \\cdot T_{eff}^4 - f \\cdot T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4} $\n    Amplitude = $ f \\left( 1 - \\frac{T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4} \\right) = f \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}} \\right)^4 \\right] $\n\n**3. Analyze the Exoplanet Transit Scenario**\n\nWhen a planet transits a star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of their projected areas.\n\n*   Amplitude = $\\frac{\\text{Area of Planet}}{\\text{Area of Star}} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\n**4. Equate the Scenarios and Solve**\n\nNow, we set the amplitude from the spots equal to the amplitude from the hypothetical planet transit and solve for the desired ratio, $R_{pl}/R_{star}$.\n\n$\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = f \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}} \\right)^4 \\right]$\n\n$\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{f \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}} \\right)^4 \\right]}$\n\nWe will now use a Python script to perform the final calculation with the given values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the star and spot properties\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\ndelta_T = 1000.0  # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\n\n# Calculate the temperature of the spots\nT_spot = T_eff - delta_T\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the signal from the starspots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# For an exoplanet transit, Amplitude = (R_pl / R_star)**2\n# Therefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude)\nRpl_over_Rstar = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(Rpl_over_Rstar)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3217926128639234\n</execute_code>\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.3218. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
