    "This is a particle annihilation problem that can be solved by applying the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis:**\n*   The reaction is $p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$.\n*   We have a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) in the initial state.\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume the system is initially at rest, or very close to it.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   The rest mass energy of an antiproton is the same as that of a proton.\n*   Therefore, $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**2. Final State Analysis:**\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. They all have the same mass, $m_A$.\n*   The rest mass energy of each A particle is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   By the conservation of momentum (the initial momentum is nearly zero), the four final particles must move apart with speeds such that the total final momentum is also zero. By symmetry, all four particles will have the same speed, $v$, and thus the same kinetic energy.\n*   The total energy of a single A particle is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles: $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n*   Substituting the given value, $E_f = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n*   According to the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy: $E_i = E_f$.\n*   $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Solving for the velocity (v):**\n*   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   Now, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find the velocity.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Plugging in the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nTo perform the calculation more precisely, we can use a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # Rest mass energy of proton in MeV\nm_a_c2 = 300      # Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# 1. Calculate initial energy (Ei)\n# The system of proton and antiproton is at rest (or slowly moving)\nEi = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# 2. Set up the equation for final energy (Ef)\n# Ef = 4 * gamma * m_a_c2\n# From conservation of energy, Ei = Ef\n# 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_a_c2\n\n# 3. Solve for the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_a_c2)\n\n# 4. Solve for beta (v/c) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"Initial Energy (Ei): {Ei:.4f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Lorentz factor (gamma): {gamma:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Velocity (v/c): {beta:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Velocity of particle A is approximately {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\n> Initial Energy (Ei): 1876.5440 MeV\n> Lorentz factor (gamma): 1.5638\n> Velocity (v/c): 0.7688\n> Velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77c\n\nThe calculation shows that the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77c. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Principle of Conservation of Energy**\nThe fundamental principle we use here is the conservation of energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation. Since this is a relativistic process, we must use the total relativistic energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy.\n\n**2. Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n*   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means we can neglect its kinetic energy. We assume the proton is also at rest for simplicity, making the initial total momentum zero.\n*   The energy in the initial state is therefore the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$. An antiproton has the same rest mass.\n*   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Final State Energy ($E_{final}$)**\n*   The final state consists of four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. They all have the same mass $m_A$.\n*   The rest mass energy of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   The initial energy ($1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$) is converted into the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy of the four A particles.\n*   The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, all four A particles must be moving at the same speed, $v$.\n*   Therefore, the total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2 = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Equating Initial and Final Energies**\n*   Now, we apply the conservation of energy: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n*   $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Solving for Velocity ($v$)**\n*   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   Next, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find the velocity $v$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n*   Rearranging the formula to solve for $v/c$:\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Plugging in our calculated value for $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
