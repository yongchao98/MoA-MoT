    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Observations:**\n    *   **1H NMR:** A single alpha-proton appears as two distinct peaks.\n        *   The total integration is correct (1H). This means we are not looking at an impurity with a different structure, but rather the same proton existing in two different chemical environments.\n        *   The peaks have roughly equal integrals, suggesting the two environments are populated in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the splitting is not due to adjacent protons.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Two peaks are observed in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n        *   The peaks have equal intensities, which corresponds to the equal integrals in the NMR. This confirms the two species are present in roughly equal amounts.\n        *   The mass spectrometry (MS) is identical for both LC peaks and matches the expected molecular weight of the product. This is a crucial piece of information. It proves that the two species are not different compounds (like a precursor or a side product) but are, in fact, **isomers** of the same molecule.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Evidence:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. Standard 1H NMR (in an achiral solvent) and standard LC (on an achiral column) cannot distinguish between enantiomers. They would show a single set of NMR peaks and a single LC peak. This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be a different chemical compound with a different molecular weight. The MS data shows both peaks have the same mass as the final product, which directly contradicts this option.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereomers will have different NMR spectra. A proton in one diastereomer will be in a different chemical environment than the equivalent proton in the other diastereomer, leading to two separate peaks. This perfectly explains the observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can often be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This perfectly explains the observation of two peaks in the LC trace.\n        *   **Combined:** This option is consistent with all the observations. A common source of diastereomerism in peptidic compounds is **cis-trans isomerism** about the amide bond. Due to the partial double-bond character of the C-N amide bond, rotation is restricted, leading to stable *cis* and *trans* conformers (also known as rotamers). These rotamers are diastereomers of each other (unless the molecule as a whole is achiral), and they are often present in comparable amounts at room temperature, giving rise to exactly the kind of duplicated signals seen in the NMR and separated peaks in the LC.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would create a byproduct with a different chemical structure and a different molecular weight. The MS data, which shows both species have the expected mass of the product, rules this option out.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The evidence points unequivocally to the presence of two isomers that can be separated chromatographically and distinguished by NMR. Only diastereomers fit this description.\n\n<<<C>>>"
