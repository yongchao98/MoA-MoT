    "The problem requires us to determine the minimum energy difference needed to resolve two quantum states with given lifetimes. This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's energy (ΔE) to the uncertainty in the time interval over which the energy is measured (Δt). The relationship is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Relate Lifetime to Uncertainty:** For an unstable quantum state, its lifetime (τ) can be interpreted as the uncertainty in time (Δt). A state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly defined energy; its energy level has a \"width\" or \"smearing,\" which is the energy uncertainty (ΔE). We can approximate the minimum energy width as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:** Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        The energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   **State 2:** Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        The energy width is ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n\n4.  **Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than their energy widths. A common criterion (similar to the Rayleigh criterion for optical resolution) is that the separation between the energy levels should be at least as large as the sum of their half-widths, or more simply, greater than the larger of the two energy widths. The broader energy level dictates the limit of resolution.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:** We can use a python script to calculate the energy widths and check the condition.\n\n```python\n# Value of the reduced Planck constant in eV·s\nh_bar_eV_s = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Given lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds for state 1\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds for state 2\n\n# Calculate the energy width (uncertainty) for each state\n# ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eV_s / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eV_s / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than their widths.\n# The state with the shorter lifetime (τ1) has the larger energy width (ΔE1).\n# This larger width sets the primary limitation for resolution.\n# So, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than ΔE1.\nprint(f\"\\nThe larger energy width is ΔE1 = {delta_E1:.3e} eV.\")\nprint(\"For the energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be significantly greater than this value.\")\n```\n\n6.  **Analyze the Results:**\n    *   From the calculation, the energy width of the first state is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   The energy width of the second state is ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   The larger energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. For the two levels to be distinguishable, their energy separation must be greater than this value.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV  (10⁻⁹ < 6.6 x 10⁻⁷) -> Not resolvable.\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV (10⁻¹¹ < 6.6 x 10⁻⁷) -> Not resolvable.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV  (10⁻⁴ > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷) -> **Clearly resolvable.**\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV  (10⁻⁸ < 6.6 x 10⁻⁷) -> Not resolvable.\n\nThe only option that provides an energy difference large enough to resolve the two energy levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user's question has been solved and I have already provided the thinking process and the final answer.\nI will now output the final answer based on my reasoning.\n\nThe thinking process is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem is about resolving two energy levels with finite lifetimes. This is governed by the time-energy uncertainty principle, ΔE⋅Δt ≥ ħ/2.\n2.  **Relate lifetime to energy uncertainty:** For an unstable state, its lifetime (τ) can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, the energy level is not perfectly sharp but has a width (natural linewidth) given by ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n3.  **Calculate the energy widths:**\n    *   State 1 has a lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s. Its energy width is ΔE₁ = ħ/τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   State 2 has a lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s. Its energy width is ΔE₂ = ħ/τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    The python code execution confirmed these calculations.\n4.  **Determine the condition for resolution:** For two energy levels to be \"clearly distinguished\" or \"resolved\", the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their energy widths. Since the energy levels themselves are \"smeared out\" by an amount ΔE, their separation must be greater than this smearing. The level with the shorter lifetime (τ₁) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁), and this larger width is the limiting factor. Therefore, the condition for resolution is |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁.\n5.  **Apply the condition:** We need |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n6.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This energy difference is much larger than the energy width of either state, so they can be clearly resolved.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n\nThe only energy difference that is sufficiently large is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
