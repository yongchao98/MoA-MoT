    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Fundamentals**\n\n*   **System:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Spin-1/2 particles are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this system is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up, `+1/2`, or spin-down, `-1/2`).\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in such a well is given by the formula:\n    E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be simplified to:\n    E_n = n² * E\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because each energy level `n` has two possible spin states (up and down), each level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two fermions.\n\n### **2. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the state of the lowest possible total energy for the system. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the lowest (`n=1`) upwards, placing the four fermions according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** We place the first two fermions in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1² * E) = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the next two fermions in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2² * E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** Sum the energies of all four particles.\n    *   E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\nThe configuration of the ground state is (2, 2, 0, ...), meaning 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2, 0 in n=3, and so on.\n\n### **3. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the state with the lowest energy just above the ground state. We achieve this by making the smallest possible \"jump\" in energy. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State:** Highest occupied level is n=2. Lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   **Excitation:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   **New Configuration:**\n    *   **Level n=1:** Still contains two particles. Energy = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n    *   **Level n=2:** Now contains only one particle. Energy = 1 × (2²E) = 4E.\n    *   **Level n=3:** Now contains one particle. Energy = 1 × (3²E) = 9E.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:** Sum the energies in the new configuration.\n    *   E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible simple excitations from the ground state and find the second-lowest energy.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excitation (found above):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: (2, 1, 1, 0,...)\n    *   Energy: 15E (This is the **First Excited State**).\n*   **Let's find the next possible excitation:** We can either move another particle or make a larger jump.\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote a particle from a lower level. Let's move a particle from n=1 to the lowest empty level, n=3.\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = [1 × (1²E)] + [2 × (2²E)] + [1 × (3²E)] = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3.\n        *   Energy = [2 × (1²E)] + [2 × (3²E)] = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4 (a higher level).\n        *   Configuration: Two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = [2 × (1²E)] + [1 × (2²E)] + [1 × (4²E)] = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing the energies of the possible excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E.\n\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** E_2nd = 18E.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies for the three states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
