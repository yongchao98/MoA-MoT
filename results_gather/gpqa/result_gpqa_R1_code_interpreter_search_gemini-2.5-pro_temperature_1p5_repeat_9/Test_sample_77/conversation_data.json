    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n    The electromagnetic potentials for a time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    Here, $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$ is the *retarded time*. It's the time at which the signal (field) must have been emitted from the source point $\\vec{r'}$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals**\n    Substituting these densities into the potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\n    The tricky part of this integral is that the retarded time $t_r$ itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r'}$. A careful evaluation of this integral (often found in advanced electromagnetism textbooks) accounts for the change in the effective volume due to the motion of the source while the signal propagates. This introduces a correction factor.\n\n    The result of the integration is:\n    $\\int \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r)) f(\\vec{r'}) d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{f(\\vec{r'})}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'})}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}} \\right]_{\\vec{r'}=\\vec{s}(t_r)}$\n    where all terms on the right are evaluated at the specific retarded time $t_r$ which satisfies $c(t-t_r) = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n\n4.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\n    Using this result and the notation from the problem statement:\n    *   Retarded position of the charge: $\\vec{s}(t_r)$\n    *   Vector from retarded position to observation point: $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n    *   Distance: $d = |\\vec{d}|$\n    *   Velocity of the charge at retarded time: $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$\n    *   Unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{d}$: $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$\n\n    The correction factor in the denominator becomes:\n    $1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd} = 1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c}$\n\n    Applying this to the integrals for V and A:\n    *   For V, $f(\\vec{r'}) = \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}$. At $\\vec{r'} = \\vec{s}(t_r)$, this is $\\frac{q}{d}$.\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q/d}{1 - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d} / c} \\right]_{t_r} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n        To match the format of the options, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   For A, $f(\\vec{r'}) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}$. At $\\vec{r'} = \\vec{s}(t_r)$, this is $\\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d}$.\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}/d}{1 - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d} / c} \\right]_{t_r} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n        Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparison with Options**\n    The derived expressions are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions perfectly match option B.\n\n    *   **Option A** has an incorrect `+` sign in the denominator.\n    *   **Option C and D** use the static potential form $V = q/(4\\pi\\epsilon_o r)$, which is only valid for a stationary charge and ignores retardation effects completely. The relation for $\\vec{A}$ is also incorrect for a general moving charge. (The relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is actually true for the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials, as can be verified using $\\mu_0\\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$, but the expression for V in options C and D is wrong).\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
