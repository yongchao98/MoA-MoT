    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n    1.  **Definition of Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers can interconvert through the migration of an atom or group, most commonly a proton. The most prevalent type is keto-enol tautomerism, where a keto form (containing a C=O group) is in equilibrium with an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group).\n    2.  **Condition for Tautomerism:** For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must possess at least one alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an alpha-carbon, which is the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n    3.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons.\n        *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons (C2, C4, C6) is a CH₂ group, meaning it is sp³ hybridized and has two acidic alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism. The resulting enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is aromatic and therefore very stable. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n    4.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at positions 1 and 4, and two C=C double bonds.\n        *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and do not have the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for simple keto-enol tautomerization.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone lacks the necessary type of alpha-hydrogens and thus does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n    5.  **Result for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    1.  **Definition of Optical Isomerism:** This occurs when a compound is chiral, meaning its molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Such compounds can rotate the plane of polarized light.\n    2.  **Condition for Optical Isomerism:** The most common structural feature leading to chirality is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups. A molecule lacking any plane of symmetry or center of inversion is chiral.\n    3.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   **Chiral Center:** The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  Hydrogen (-H)\n            2.  Hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  Methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  Methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n    4.  **Analysis of Dimethyl Fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the double bond. It does not have any chiral centers.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Because the molecule is achiral (it is superimposable on its mirror image), it does not show optical isomerism.\n    5.  **Result for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
