    "The user wants to calculate the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species:** The solution contains a central metal ion, `Co^2+`, and a ligand, thiocyanate `SCN-`. They form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]^+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]^-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`. The uncomplexed cobalt ion exists as the hydrated ion, `[Co(H2O)6]^2+`, which we can denote as `Co^2+`.\n\n2.  **State the given information:**\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10^-2 M = 0.01 M`.\n    *   Total thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN-]_total = 0.1 M`.\n    *   Overall stability constants (`β`):\n        *   `β1` (for `[Co(SCN)]^+`) = 9\n        *   `β2` (for `[Co(SCN)2]`) = 40\n        *   `β3` (for `[Co(SCN)3]^-`) = 63\n        *   `β4` (for `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`) = 16\n\n3.  **Formulate the problem:** The goal is to find the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is the mole fraction (`α2`) of the `[Co(SCN)2]` species, multiplied by 100.\n\n4.  **Mass Balance Equation:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free `Co^2+` ion and all its complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n5.  **Express concentrations using stability constants:** The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]`, and the overall stability constants (`βn`):\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n6.  **Mole Fraction (`α`) Formula:** The fraction of a particular species `[Co(SCN)n]` (`αn`) is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`.\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    By substituting the expressions from step 5 into the mass balance equation (step 4), we get:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n    Now substitute this and the expression for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` into the formula for `α2`:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n7.  **Approximate the free ligand concentration:** The initial thiocyanate concentration (`0.1 M`) is 10 times larger than the total cobalt concentration (`0.01 M`). This suggests that the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is small compared to the total amount available. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium `[SCN-]` by its initial concentration, `0.1 M`. This is a common and valid simplification in such problems.\n    `[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\n8.  **Calculate the value of `α2`:** Now, we plug the given values into the formula for `α2`. Let `L = [SCN-] = 0.1`.\n\n    *   **Numerator:** `β2 * L^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   **Denominator:** This is the sum of all terms:\n        *   `1` (for free `Co^2+`)\n        *   `β1 * L = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n        *   `β2 * L^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n        *   `β3 * L^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n        *   `β4 * L^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n        *   **Sum (Denominator)** = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    *   **Mole Fraction `α2`:** `α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n9.  **Calculate the percentage:** The percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex is `α2 * 100%`.\n    Percentage = `0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`.\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%, which matches option A. The adjective \"blue\" in the question refers to the overall color of the solution containing various thiocyanato-cobalt complexes, but the calculation is specifically for the \"dithiocyanato cobalt(II)\" species, i.e., `[Co(SCN)2]`.\n\nI will use a Python script to verify the calculation.\n```python\n# Define the given constants\nL = 0.1  # Equilibrium concentration of thiocyanate ligand [SCN-], in M\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# The numerator of the alpha_2 fraction is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = beta2 * (L**2)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of the terms for all cobalt-containing species\n# (normalized by the free Co(II) concentration)\n# Term for Co^2+ is 1\n# Term for [Co(SCN)]+ is beta1 * L\n# Term for [Co(SCN)2] is beta2 * L^2\n# Term for [Co(SCN)3]- is beta3 * L^3\n# Term for [Co(SCN)4]^2- is beta4 * L^4\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * L) + (beta2 * L**2) + (beta3 * L**3) + (beta4 * L**4)\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<execute_code>\n16.916180326482278\n</execute_code>\n\nThe code output confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is `16.916%`, which rounds to `16.9%`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt species in the solution. This mole fraction, when multiplied by 100, gives the desired percentage.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nThe solution contains a central metal ion, Co²⁺, and a ligand, SCN⁻. They form a series of complexes in equilibrium:\n*   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺` (governed by `β₁`)\n*   `Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]` (governed by `β₂`)\n*   `Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (governed by `β₃`)\n*   `Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (governed by `β₄`)\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free (hydrated) ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**2. Use Stability Constants**\n\nThe concentrations of the complexes can be expressed using the overall stability constants (`βn`):\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**3. Formulate the Mole Fraction (α)**\n\nThe mole fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]` (let's call it `α₂`), is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from step 2 into the `c(Co)` equation from step 1, we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, we can write the expression for `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the formula to:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Approximate the Free Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe total thiocyanate concentration (`0.1 M`) is significantly larger than the total cobalt concentration (`0.01 M`). This means that only a small fraction of the thiocyanate will be used up in forming complexes. Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of free ligand `[SCN⁻]` by its initial concentration.\n`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**5. Calculation**\n\nNow we plug the given values into the formula for `α₂`. Let `L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.\n\n*   **Numerator:** `β₂ * L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator:** `1 + (β₁ * L) + (β₂ * L²) + (β₃ * L³) + (β₄ * L⁴)`\n    *   `1`\n    *   `9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    *   `40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   `63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   `16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n*   **Sum of Denominator:** `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**6. Convert to Percentage**\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the mole fraction `α₂` by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value rounds to 16.9%, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
