    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The potential given is $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential energy of a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the restoring force is the same in all directions, i.e., the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same for x, y, and z directions.\n\n2.  **Recall the Energy Eigenvalues:** The energy levels for a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator are quantized. The energy eigenvalues, $E_N$, are given by the formula:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $N$ is the principal quantum number, which can take non-negative integer values ($N = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$).\n\n3.  **Determine the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    *   The ground state corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which is when $N=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   The first excited state corresponds to $N=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   The second excited state corresponds to $N=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   The **third excited state** corresponds to $N=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n\n4.  **Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have that same energy. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the principal quantum number $N$ is related to the quantum numbers in Cartesian coordinates by $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. The degeneracy of the level $N$, denoted as $g_N$, is the number of ways to choose these three non-negative integers so that they sum to $N$.\n\n    The formula for the degeneracy is:\n    $g_N = \\frac{(N + 1)(N + 2)}{2}$\n\n    For the third excited state, we have $N=3$. Let's calculate the degeneracy:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3 + 1)(3 + 2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\n    We can also find this by explicitly listing the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). (3 states)\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). (6 states)\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1,1,1). (1 state)\n    *   Total number of states = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n    So, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   Energy: $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   Degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions): 10\n\n    Matching this with the options:\n    A) Incorrect energy formula and degeneracy.\n    B) Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy.\n    C) Correct energy ($\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$) and correct degeneracy (10).\n    D) Incorrect energy formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
