    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with the formula CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It possesses one chiral center at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration. Since the problem specifies the configuration, we are starting with an enantiomerically pure compound.\n\n2.  **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide ion to form the alcohol.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** The carbonyl group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by this reaction.\n    *   Since the attack happens at a prochiral center in a molecule that is already chiral, the two transition states are diastereomeric. This leads to the formation of two products that are diastereomers of each other. They are typically not formed in a 1:1 ratio, but two distinct products are formed.\n\n4.  **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are stereoisomers but are not mirror images of each other, hence they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a diketone with the formula CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has no stereocenters and has a plane of symmetry.\n\n2.  **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that also reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" implies that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** Both carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Products:**\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze the relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n        *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C3 carbon. Therefore, it is an achiral **meso compound**. Its mirror image is (2S, 4R), which is identical to (2R, 4S).\n    *   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatography Analysis of the Combined Products**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different stereoisomeric compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus **will be separated**. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II are one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers. It will be separated from them, giving **1 peak**.\n        *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **will not be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak** for the racemic pair.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers. They have different molecular weights, structures, and polarities, so they will be easily separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **2. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with different stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The chiral column will separate all five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture, assuming the column is appropriate for these compounds.\n        *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n        *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2, diastereomer of Peak 1)\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4, enantiomer of Peak 3)\n        *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5, achiral and diastereomer of Peaks 3 & 4)\n*   **Total Peaks:** The chiral column can resolve all five unique stereoisomers. This gives a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
