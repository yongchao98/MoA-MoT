    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The peak is broad due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not help differentiate between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Key splitting patterns:** The most crucial pieces of information are the complex splitting patterns observed for two different signals:\n    *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n**3. Decoding the Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe multiplicity of a signal is given by the (n+1) rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. A complex splitting pattern like a \"doublet of triplets\" means the proton is being split by two different, non-equivalent groups of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   A group with 1 proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with 2 protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   A group with 3 protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n    This implies a methine (CH) proton must be adjacent to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   A group with 1 proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with 2 protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   Another, chemically different group with 2 protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n    This implies a methine (CH) proton must be adjacent to a CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nThe chemical formulas in the options contain pentavalent carbons, which is impossible. This indicates a typo. We will interpret the notation `C(H)(R)` as a `-CH(R)-` link in the carbon chain.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid.** This structure does not have any protons that would give a `dtq` or `dtt` signal.\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid.** The proton at C3 is coupled to a CH (1H) and two different CH₂ groups (2H each). This would produce a `dtt` signal. However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group simultaneously, so there would be no `dtq` signal.\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid.** This structure does not have any protons that would give a `dtq` or `dtt` signal. The most complex signal would be a doublet of triplets.\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid.**\n    Let's draw this structure and analyze the key protons.\n    `                      CH₃(g) `\n    `                       | `\n    ` CH₃(f) - CH₂(d) - CH(c) - CH(b)(CH₂(e)CH₃(e')) - CH₂(a) - COOH `\n\n    *   **Analyze the proton on C3 (Hᵇ):**\n        *   It is adjacent to C2, which has a CH₂ group (2 protons, Hᵃ). Coupling gives a **triplet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to C4, which has a CH group (1 proton, Hᶜ). Coupling gives a **doublet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the ethyl branch at C3, which has a CH₂ group (2 protons, Hᵉ). Coupling gives a **triplet**.\n        *   Combining these, the signal for Hᵇ is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n    *   **Analyze the proton on C4 (Hᶜ):**\n        *   It is adjacent to C3, which has a CH group (1 proton, Hᵇ). Coupling gives a **doublet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to C5, which has a CH₂ group (2 protons, Hᵈ). Coupling gives a **triplet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the methyl branch at C4, which has a CH₃ group (3 protons, Hᵍ). Coupling gives a **quartet**.\n        *   Combining these, the signal for Hᶜ is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other observed signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option C, **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**, has protons that match both of the complex splitting patterns (`dtt` and `dtq`) described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
