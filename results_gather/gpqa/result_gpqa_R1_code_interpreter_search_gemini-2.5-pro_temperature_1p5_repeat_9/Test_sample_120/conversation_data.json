    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring. The numbers [4.1.0] indicate the bridge between the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C6) has 4 carbons (C2, C3, C4, C5), 1 carbon (C7, which is the oxygen), and 0 carbons directly connecting them. This is a cis-fused system.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to determine the 3D arrangement of the groups based on the given (R/S) configuration. Let's use a planar representation with wedges (up, β) and dashes (down, α) for clarity. By convention, we can place the epoxide oxygen `up` (wedged).\n\nLet's assign the stereochemistry for each center to find the correct 3D structure.\n\n*   **Epoxide Oxygen:** Let's assume it's `up` (wedged). The bonds C1-O and C6-O are wedged.\n\n*   **Center C1 (must be R):**\n    *   Priorities of groups attached to C1: O > C6 > C2 > Me. (Priority is determined by CIP rules. O is #1. C6 is attached to O, C, C while C2 is attached to C, C, H, so C6 > C2. Me is last).\n    *   To determine the configuration, let's assume the lowest priority group (Me) is `down` (dashed). Tracing from highest to lowest priority (O → C6 → C2) gives a clockwise (CW) turn. Since the lowest priority group is in the back, the configuration is **R**.\n    *   Conclusion: **C1-Me is `down` (dashed)**, trans to the epoxide oxygen.\n\n*   **Center C6 (must be S):**\n    *   Priorities: O > C1 > C5 > H.\n    *   To get S, with the lowest priority group (H) `down` (dashed), the path O → C1 → C5 must be counter-clockwise (CCW). Tracing this path on our drawing is indeed CCW.\n    *   Conclusion: **H at C6 is `down` (dashed)**.\n\n*   **Center C3 (must be R):**\n    *   Priorities: **C2 > C4 > Me > H**. (C2 is bonded to C1, which has an oxygen, giving it higher priority than C4 which is bonded to carbons with no oxygens nearby).\n    *   To get R, with H `down` (dashed), the path C2 → C4 → Me must be CW. To achieve this, the methyl group must be pointing `up`.\n    *   Conclusion: **C3-Me is `up` (wedged)**.\n\n*   **Center C4 (must be R):**\n    *   Priorities: C3 > C5 > Me > H. (C3 has a methyl group, C5 does not).\n    *   To get R, with H `down` (dashed), the path C3 → C5 → Me must be CW. To achieve this, the methyl group must be pointing `down`.\n    *   Conclusion: **C4-Me is `down` (dashed)**.\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide Oxygen: Up (wedged)\n*   C1-Methyl: Down (dashed)\n*   C6-Hydrogen: Down (dashed)\n*   C3-Methyl: Up (wedged)\n*   C4-Methyl: Down (dashed)\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). The nucleophile is a methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that for saturated epoxides, organocuprates attack the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    *   C1 has a methyl group.\n    *   C6 has a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less hindered carbon and will be attacked by the Me⁻ nucleophile.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism, which involves **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack).\n    *   The C6-O bond is `up` (wedged).\n    *   The Me⁻ nucleophile will attack C6 from the `down` side (dashed).\n    *   This attack breaks the C6-O bond, and the electron pair moves to the oxygen atom, which remains attached to C1.\n    *   The original H atom on C6, which was `down` (dashed), is pushed `up` (wedged) by the incoming methyl group.\n    *   The oxygen, now an alkoxide (O⁻), is still attached to C1 and points `up`. After an acidic workup (implicit), it becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group, pointing `up`.\n\n### 3. Determine the Product Structure\n\n1.  **Skeleton:** The epoxide ring opens to form a cyclohexanol derivative.\n2.  **Numbering:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, we number the ring C1(old C1) → C2(old C6) → C3(old C5) → C4(old C4) → C5(old C3) → C6(old C2). This gives substituent locants 1,2,4,5. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   **New C1 (Old C1):** The -OH group is `up` (wedged). The original C1-Me group is `down` (dashed).\n    *   **New C2 (Old C6):** The new methyl group (from Me₂CuLi) is `down` (dashed). The original H is now `up` (wedged).\n    *   **New C4 (Old C4):** The configuration is unchanged. Me is `down` (dashed), H is `up` (wedged).\n    *   **New C5 (Old C3):** The configuration is unchanged. Me is `up` (wedged), H is `down` (dashed).\n\n### 4. Assign R/S Configuration to the Product\n\n*   **New C1:** Pri: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. The lowest priority group (Me) is `down` (dashed). The path from OH → C2 → C6 is **clockwise (CW)**. So, C1 is **(1R)**.\n*   **New C2:** Pri: C1 > C5 > Me > H. The lowest priority group (H) is `up` (wedged). The path from C1 → C5 → Me is **clockwise (CW)**. Since H is up, we reverse the assignment. So, C2 is **(2S)**.\n*   **New C4:** Pri: C5 > C3 > Me > H. The lowest priority group (H) is `up` (wedged). The path from C5 → C3 → Me is **counter-clockwise (CCW)**. Since H is up, we reverse the assignment. So, C4 is **(4R)**.\n*   **New C5:** Pri: **C6 > C4 > Me > H**. (The priority between C4 and C6 is decided by proximity to the high-priority -OH group at C1; C6 is closer to C1 than C4 is). The lowest priority group (H) is `down` (dashed). The path from C6 → C4 → Me is **clockwise (CW)**. Since H is down, we do not reverse. So, C5 is **(5R)**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
