    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the characteristic range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Specifically, a peak at 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ combined with a broad O-H peak is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n### **2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, which supports the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass calculation: C (12) + O (16) + O (16) + H (1) = 45 amu.\n*   This fragment provides definitive evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group in the molecule.\n\n### **4. Synthesis and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nFrom the combined spectral data, we have established that the unknown molecule must contain:\n1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which includes a C=O double bond.\n2.  An alkene group (C=C).\n\nThe presence of a double bond or a ring in a molecule corresponds to one degree of unsaturation (DoU). Our unknown has a C=O double bond (1 DoU) and a C=C double bond (1 DoU), so it must have a total of **at least two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for each of the given chemical formulas using the formula:\n**DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)** (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n\n*   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is insufficient. A molecule with this formula (e.g., hexanoic acid) is saturated and does not contain a C=C bond.\n*   **B) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has the correct DoU. However, it only contains one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n*   **C) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula has an incorrect DoU and only one oxygen atom.\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation and two oxygen atoms. This is perfectly consistent with a molecule containing one alkene (C=C) and one carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. An example would be a hexenoic acid.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe formula C6H10O2 is the only option that satisfies all the evidence from the FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. It has the required two degrees of unsaturation and the necessary two oxygen atoms to be an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
