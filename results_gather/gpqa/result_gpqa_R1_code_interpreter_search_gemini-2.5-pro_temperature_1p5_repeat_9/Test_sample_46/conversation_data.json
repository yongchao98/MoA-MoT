    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: `DoU = C + 1 + N/2 - H/2`.\n    *   `DoU = 9 + 1 + 1/2 - 11/2 = 10 - 5 = 5`.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two medium to strong bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). This indicates the presence of an -NH2 group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the carbonyl stretching region. This frequency is typical for a conjugated ester (an ester group attached to a double bond or aromatic ring, which lowers the frequency from the usual ~1735-1750 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, appearing as a triplet. This is the classic signature of a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, appearing as a quartet. This indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm is highly downfield, which is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-). Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm strongly indicate the presence of an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. The broadness is typical for protons on a heteroatom that can undergo chemical exchange, and the integration (2H) and chemical shift are consistent with the protons of the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) group identified from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each a doublet integrating to 2 protons, are the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two sets of equivalent protons.\n        *   The doublet at **8.0 ppm** is far downfield, indicating these protons are ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester, -COOCH2CH3).\n        *   The doublet at **7.0 ppm** is upfield, indicating these protons are ortho to an electron-donating group (like the amine, -NH2).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together:**\n    1.  We have a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The two substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but it would have a -O-C6H4- linkage. The propionate CH2 group would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: the formula, the IR bands for -NH2 and conjugated ester, and all the 1H NMR signals (para-substituted ring, ethyl ester group, and primary amine). This compound is also known as Benzocaine.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is an amide, not an amine, and would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. It would also have a formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8-8.5 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a *meta*-substituted compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets. It is also a primary amide, which would have a C=O stretch closer to 1680 cm-1.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
