    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step-by-step Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid + Bromine + Pyridine + Acetic anhydride (heating) -> Product 1**\n    *   This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n    *   Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon.\n    *   Product 1 is **Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH)**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + Ethanol + Sulfuric acid (heating) -> Product 2**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄).\n    *   Br-CH₂-COOH + CH₃CH₂OH → Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃ + H₂O\n    *   Product 2 is **Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + Sodium cyanide (NaCN) -> Product 3**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion from the alpha-carbon.\n    *   Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃ + NaBr\n    *   Product 3 is **Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + excess Sodium Hydride (NaH) + 1,5-dibromopentane -> Product 4**\n    *   This is a multi-step, one-pot reaction involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    *   **a) First deprotonation:** The methylene protons (CH₂) in ethyl cyanoacetate are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making them acidic. The strong base sodium hydride (NaH) deprotonates this carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **b) First alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    *   **c) Second deprotonation:** The problem states that NaH is in *excess*. The newly formed product still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. Excess NaH will deprotonate it.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **d) Intramolecular cyclization:** The carbanion on the alpha-carbon now attacks the other end of the pentane chain, which has the second bromine atom. This is an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction that closes a ring. The ring is formed from the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, creating a six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product, Product 4, is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogen signals. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the stereochemical relationship between its protons (homotopic, enantiotopic, diastereotopic). Standard NMR problems of this type require analysis of the static molecule, not the time-averaged spectrum at high temperatures, especially given the hint about distinguishing signals.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\nA cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) on C1.\n\n```\n      COOCH₂CH₃\n     /\n   C1--CN\n  /  \\\n C2--C6\n |    |\n C3--C5\n  \\  /\n   C4\n```\n\n**Symmetry Analysis:**\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This means:\n*   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n*   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n*   Protons on C2 are equivalent to corresponding protons on C6.\n*   Protons on C3 are equivalent to corresponding protons on C5.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\nWe count the number of sets of chemically non-equivalent protons.\nProtons that are diastereotopic are chemically non-equivalent and give distinct signals. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are diastereotopic.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH₂-CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃**: The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **-O-CH₂-**: The molecule as a whole is achiral (it possesses a plane of symmetry). The two protons on the methylene group are related by this plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. **(1 signal)**\n    *   *Total for ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** The axial proton on C2 (H2ax) is diastereotopic to the equatorial proton on C2 (H2eq), so they are distinct. The symmetry plane makes H2ax equivalent to H6ax, and H2eq equivalent to H6eq. This gives two distinct sets of protons: {H2ax, H6ax} and {H2eq, H6eq}. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane establishes equivalence between C3 and C5. This gives two distinct sets: {H3ax, H5ax} and {H3eq, H5eq}. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons, H4ax and H4eq, are diastereotopic. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n    *   *Total for ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nTotal signals = (Signals from ethyl group) + (Signals from ring) = 2 + 6 = **8**\n\nThus, there are 8 chemically distinct types of hydrogens in the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
