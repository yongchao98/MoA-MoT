    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene` is a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and 4.\n*   **Principal Functional Group:** `-carboxylic acid` (-COOH) is at position C1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position C2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is at position C5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the formyl group.\n    *   Total Oxygens = 2 + 1 = 3.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    We can calculate this using the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant structure. The IHD represents the sum of rings and pi (Ï€) bonds.\n    *   1 ring = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=C bond in the ring = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=C bond in the vinyl group = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=O bond in the formyl group = 1 IHD\n    *   Total IHD of reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n    Now, use the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2.\n    *   5 = 10 + 1 - H/2\n    *   5 = 11 - H/2\n    *   H/2 = 11 - 5 = 6\n    *   H = 12.\n*   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Identify the reaction and the product.**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**.\n\n*   This reagent is a very strong reducing agent. It performs a complete reduction on oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds).\n*   **Effect on functional groups:**\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Aldehyde (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The alkene in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   The alkene in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The reaction does not break the C-C bonds of the ring.\n*   The carbon skeleton of the molecule is preserved. The product will still have 10 carbon atoms and a single ring structure.\n*   All oxygen atoms are removed, and all pi bonds are saturated with hydrogen. The final product is a **saturated monocyclic alkane**.\n\n**3. Determine the molecular formula of the product.**\n\n*   The product has 10 carbon atoms (C10).\n*   Since it is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane), its general formula is **CnH2n**.\n*   For n=10, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nThe IHD can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the molecular formula (C10H20).**\n    The formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 (for a hydrocarbon).\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    *   IHD = 11 - 10\n    *   IHD = 1\n\n*   **Method 2: By analyzing the structure.**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of pi bonds = 0 (the molecule is fully saturated)\n    *   IHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nBoth methods give an IHD of 1. This value corresponds to the presence of the single ring in the final product molecule.\n\nWe can use a simple python script to confirm the IHD calculation.\n```python\n# The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbons.\n# Its general formula is C(n)H(2n).\n# For n=10, the formula is C10H20.\nC = 10\nH = 20\n\n# The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) formula is:\n# IHD = C + 1 - (H / 2) - (X / 2) + (N / 2)\n# For a hydrocarbon, this simplifies to IHD = C + 1 - (H / 2)\nihd = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n\nprint(int(ihd))\n```",
    "The python code confirms that for a molecule with the formula C10H20, the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is 1.\n\n*   **Reactant Analysis:** The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   Molecular Formula: C10H12O3.\n    *   Structure contains: 1 ring, 3 C=C bonds (one in ring, one in vinyl), and 2 C=O bonds (one in acid, one in aldehyde).\n    *   Reactant IHD = 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (acid C=O) + 1 (aldehyde C=O) = 5.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The reagent is Red Phosphorus + excess HI. This is a powerful reducing agent that reduces almost all functional groups containing oxygen and unsaturations.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The aldehyde group (-CHO) is reduced to a hydrocarbon.\n    *   All C=C double bonds are hydrogenated to C-C single bonds.\n    *   The overall effect is to remove all oxygen atoms and saturate all pi bonds.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The reaction does not break the carbon ring.\n    *   The product will be a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated monocyclic alkane.\n    *   The initial 10-carbon skeleton is preserved.\n    *   The final product is a C10 alkane containing one ring.\n*   **Calculating IHD of the Product:**\n    *   The IHD formula is: IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds).\n    *   For the product:\n        *   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n        *   Number of pi bonds = 0 (all double bonds and carbonyl groups are reduced).\n    *   Therefore, the IHD of the product = 1 + 0 = 1.\n    *   Alternatively, a saturated monocyclic alkane has the general formula CnH2n. For C=10, the formula is C10H20. Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 20/2 = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1, which corresponds to the single ring structure that remains after the complete reduction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
