    "This problem requires us to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2.\n\n1.  **Identify the formula for transit probability.**\n    The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `p_transit = R_s / a`\n\n2.  **Relate the semi-major axis to the given orbital period and stellar mass.**\n    We can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. The law states:\n    `P^2 = (4 * π^2 / (G * (M_s + m_p))) * a^3`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `M_s` is the star's mass, `m_p` is the planet's mass, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n    Since the planets are Earth-like, their mass (`m_p`) is negligible compared to their host star's mass (`M_s`). So, `M_s + m_p ≈ M_s`.\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s`\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n    `a^3 ∝ M_s * P^2`\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\n3.  **Combine the formulas to get a single expression for transit probability.**\n    Substitute the expression for `a` into the transit probability formula:\n    `p_transit ∝ R_s / (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `p_transit ∝ R_s * M_s^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2.**\n    Let `p1` be the probability for Planet_1 and `p2` be the probability for Planet_2.\n    `Ratio = p1 / p2 = (R_s1 * M_s1^(-1/3) * P1^(-2/3)) / (R_s2 * M_s2^(-1/3) * P2^(-2/3))`\n\n5.  **Substitute the given relationships between the two systems.**\n    We are given:\n    *   Radius of Star 1 = Radius of Star 2 (`R_s1 = R_s2`)\n    *   Mass of Star 1 = 2 * Mass of Star 2 (`M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`)\n    *   Period of Planet 1 = Period of Planet 2 / 3 (`P1 = P2 / 3`)\n\n    Substitute these into the ratio formula:\n    `Ratio = (R_s2 * (2 * M_s2)^(-1/3) * (P2 / 3)^(-2/3)) / (R_s2 * M_s2^(-1/3) * P2^(-2/3))`\n\n6.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    Cancel out the common terms (`R_s2`, `M_s2^(-1/3)`, `P2^(-2/3)`):\n    `Ratio = (2^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3))`\n    `Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3)`\n    `Ratio = (3^2 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Compute the numerical value.**\n    We can calculate the cube root of 4.5.\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    ratio = math.pow(4.5, 1/3)\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    >>> 1.6509640134795056\n\nThe ratio of the probabilities is approximately 1.65. This means that Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability of transiting than Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
