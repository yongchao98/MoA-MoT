    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of substituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange these substances in order of increasing yield of the *para*-bromo derivative.\n\n`C6H5-X + Br2 (excess) --(catalyst)--> p-Br-C6H4-X`\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer is determined by the directing effect of the substituent 'X' already on the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents (X)**\n\nSubstituents are classified based on how they influence the reactivity and orientation of electrophilic substitution.\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile to the *ortho* and *para* positions. These will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl): Activating\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl): Activating\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density via the inductive effect but can donate via resonance. They are less reactive than benzene but still direct to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro): Deactivating\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it much less reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile to the *meta* position. These will produce a very small amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl carboxylate)\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid)\n\n**3. Arrange the Groups with the Lowest Para-Yield (Meta-Directors)**\n\nSubstances 2, 4, and 6 are meta-directors. They will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer and will come first in the ordered list. To order them amongst themselves, we consider their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n`-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`\n\n*   `-NO2` is the most deactivating.\n*   `-COOH` is slightly more deactivating than `-COOC2H5` because the alkyl group in the ester is weakly electron-donating, slightly offsetting the withdrawal effect.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three is:\n`C6H5-NO2 (4)` < `C6H5-COOH (6)` < `C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)`\n\nThe sequence must begin with `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n**4. Arrange the Groups with the Highest Para-Yield (Ortho-, Para-Directors)**\n\nSubstances 1, 3, and 5 are all ortho-, para-directors. To order them, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This ratio is primarily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is larger and bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). The increased steric hindrance from the ethyl group makes attack at the ortho positions less favorable compared to the para position. Thus, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-product than toluene.\n    *   Yield of para-isomer: `Ethylbenzene (5)` > `Toluene (1)`\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: `1 < 5`\n\n*   **Comparing with Halogen (3):** The chlorine atom in chlorobenzene is an ortho-, para-director. While it deactivates the ring, it is known to produce a very high yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions. This is due to a combination of its size and its strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect (-I effect), which deactivates the adjacent ortho positions more than the distant para position. The para-yield for bromination of chlorobenzene is typically very high (~87%), which is higher than that for toluene or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Yield of para-isomer: `Chlorobenzene (3)` > `Ethylbenzene (5)` > `Toluene (1)`\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\n**5. Combine the Sequences**\n\nNow, we combine the two groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para-yield, followed by the ortho-, para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Ortho-, para-directors order: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n`4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
