    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Metric and the Geometry\nThe given metric is:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThis is a metric on a 2-dimensional space with coordinates $(x, y)$. The metric components, in the form $ds^2 = g_{xx} dx^2 + 2g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy^2$, are:\n$g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\nThe term \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" refers to the space described by this metric. The metric is defined only when the denominator is positive, i.e., $4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0$, which is equivalent to $x^2 + y^2 < 4$. This is an open disk of radius 2 centered at the origin in the $xy$-plane. The question asks for the total area of this disk as measured by the given metric.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Area Integral\nThe area element $dA$ in a 2D space is given by $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$, where $g$ is the metric tensor.\nThe metric tensor is:\n$g = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{xx} & g_{xy} \\\\ g_{yx} & g_{yy} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe determinant of the metric tensor is:\n$\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2 - 0 = \\frac{32^2}{(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^2}$\n\nThe area element is therefore:\n$dA = \\sqrt{\\frac{32^2}{(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^2}} \\, dx \\, dy = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n(We take the positive root as the area element must be positive).\n\nThe total area $A$ is the integral of this area element over the domain of definition, which is the disk $D = \\{(x, y) | x^2 + y^2 < 4\\}$.\n$A = \\iint_{D} \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n### 3. Convert to Polar Coordinates\nTo evaluate this integral, it is convenient to switch to polar coordinates. Let:\n$x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$\n$y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$\nThen $x^2 + y^2 = \\rho^2$. The differential area element in Cartesian coordinates $dx \\, dy$ becomes $\\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$ in polar coordinates.\n\nThe domain of integration $x^2+y^2 < 4$ becomes $0 \\le \\rho < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$.\n\nThe integral for the area in polar coordinates is:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\, (\\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta)$\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Integral\nWe can separate the integral into two parts, one for $\\theta$ and one for $\\rho$:\n$A = 32 \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} d\\rho \\right)$\n\nThe integral over $\\theta$ is straightforward:\n$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = [\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$\n\nSo the area is:\n$A = 32 \\cdot 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} d\\rho = 64\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} d\\rho$\n\nThe integral over $\\rho$ is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}$ has a singularity at $\\rho = 2$. We need to evaluate it using a limit:\n$I_\\rho = \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\int_{0}^{b} \\frac{\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} d\\rho$\n\nTo solve this integral, we use a substitution. Let $u = 4-\\rho^2$. Then $du = -2\\rho \\, d\\rho$, which means $\\rho \\, d\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2} du$.\nThe limits of integration for $u$ are:\n- When $\\rho = 0$, $u = 4 - 0^2 = 4$.\n- When $\\rho = b$, $u = 4 - b^2$.\n\nNow, substitute into the integral:\n$I_\\rho = \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\int_{4}^{4-b^2} \\frac{1}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} du\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\int_{4}^{4-b^2} \\frac{1}{u} du$\n$= -\\frac{1}{2} \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} [\\ln|u|]_{4}^{4-b^2}$\n$= -\\frac{1}{2} \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} (\\ln|4-b^2| - \\ln|4|)$\n$= \\frac{1}{2} \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} (\\ln(4) - \\ln(4-b^2))$\n\nAs $b$ approaches $2$ from below, $b^2$ approaches $4$, and $4-b^2$ approaches $0$ from the positive side ($0^+$). The natural logarithm $\\ln(x)$ approaches $-\\infty$ as $x$ approaches $0^+$.\n$\\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\ln(4-b^2) = -\\infty$\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is:\n$I_\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} (\\ln(4) - (-\\infty)) = +\\infty$\n\nSince the integral over $\\rho$ diverges to infinity, the total area $A$ is:\n$A = 64\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe calculated area is infinite. Let's check the given options:\nA) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)$: This is not a constant value; an area must be a single scalar value.\nB) $+\\infty$: This matches our calculation.\nC) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)$: This is also not a constant value.\nD) $0$: The integrand for the area is strictly positive over the entire domain, so the area cannot be zero.\n\nThe only plausible and correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
