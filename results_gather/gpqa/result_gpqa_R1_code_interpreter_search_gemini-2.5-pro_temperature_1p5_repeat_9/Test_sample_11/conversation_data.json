    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThis problem involves the decay of a particle at rest into two other particles. The key principles to apply are:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n**2. Define the System**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A positive pion (Pi+) is at rest.\n    *   Mass of Pi+ ($m_{Pi}$) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n    *   Initial momentum ($p_{initial}$) = 0 (since it's stationary)\n    *   Initial energy ($E_{initial}$) = Rest mass energy of the pion = $m_{Pi}c^2$ = 139.6 MeV.\n\n*   **Final State:** The pion decays into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu).\n    *   Mass of mu+ ($m_{mu}$) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n    *   Mass of neutrino ($m_{nu}$) ≈ 0 (Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is considered negligible in this type of calculation).\n    *   Let the kinetic energies be $KE_{mu}$ and $KE_{nu}$.\n    *   Let the momenta be $p_{mu}$ and $p_{nu}$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n$p_{initial}$ = $p_{final}$\n0 = $p_{mu}$ + $p_{nu}$\n\nThis means the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\nLet $p = |p_{mu}| = |p_{nu}|$.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total initial energy equals the total final energy.\n$E_{initial}$ = $E_{final}$\n$m_{Pi}c^2$ = $E_{mu}$ + $E_{nu}$\n\nWhere $E_{mu}$ and $E_{nu}$ are the total relativistic energies of the muon and neutrino.\n*   For the muon: $E_{mu} = KE_{mu} + m_{mu}c^2$\n*   For the massless neutrino: Its energy is purely kinetic, so $E_{nu} = KE_{nu}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\n139.6 MeV = ($KE_{mu}$ + $m_{mu}c^2$) + $KE_{nu}$\n139.6 MeV = ($KE_{mu}$ + 105.7 MeV) + $KE_{nu}$  --- (Equation 1)\n\n**5. Relate Energy and Momentum**\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n\n*   For the muon:\n    $E_{mu}^2 = (p_{mu}c)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n    $(KE_{mu} + m_{mu}c^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2$  --- (Equation 2)\n\n*   For the massless neutrino:\n    $E_{nu}^2 = (p_{nu}c)^2 + (m_{nu}c^2)^2$\n    $KE_{nu}^2 = (pc)^2 + 0$\n    $KE_{nu} = pc$  --- (Equation 3)\n\n**6. Solve for the Kinetic Energies**\n\nNow we have a system of equations. Let's solve for $KE_{mu}$ first.\n\nFrom Equation 3, we can substitute $pc = KE_{nu}$ into Equation 2:\n$(KE_{mu} + m_{mu}c^2)^2 = (KE_{nu})^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n\nFrom Equation 1, we can express $KE_{nu}$ in terms of $KE_{mu}$:\n$KE_{nu}$ = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - $KE_{mu}$\n$KE_{nu}$ = 33.9 MeV - $KE_{mu}$\n\nNow substitute this expression for $KE_{nu}$ into the combined equation:\n$(KE_{mu} + 105.7)^2 = (33.9 - KE_{mu})^2 + (105.7)^2$\n\nExpand both sides:\n$KE_{mu}^2 + 2(105.7)KE_{mu} + 105.7^2 = (33.9^2 - 2(33.9)KE_{mu} + KE_{mu}^2) + 105.7^2$\n\nThe $KE_{mu}^2$ and $105.7^2$ terms cancel out from both sides:\n$2(105.7)KE_{mu} = 33.9^2 - 2(33.9)KE_{mu}$\n\nNow, we can solve for $KE_{mu}$ using a Python script for precision.\n```python\n# Given values in MeV\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# We derived the equation: 2 * m_mu * KE_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)^2 - 2 * (m_pi - m_mu) * KE_mu\n# Rearranging for KE_mu:\n# KE_mu * (2 * m_mu + 2 * (m_pi - m_mu)) = (m_pi - m_mu)^2\n# KE_mu * (2 * m_pi) = (m_pi - m_mu)^2\n# KE_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)**2 / (2 * m_pi)\n\nKE_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)**2 / (2 * m_pi)\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\n\n# The total kinetic energy released is the Q-value of the reaction\nQ_value = m_pi - m_mu\n# This energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino\n# Q_value = KE_mu + KE_nu\nKE_nu = Q_value - KE_mu\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculation shows that the kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is approximately **4.12 MeV**, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is approximately **29.78 MeV** (which rounds to 29.8 MeV).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculations are as follows:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, its momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. This means the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu) must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum be 'p'.\n    $p_{mu} = p_{nu} = p$\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay equals the total energy after the decay. The initial energy is the rest mass energy of the pion. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    $E_{Pi} = E_{mu} + E_{nu}$\n\n    Using the rest mass values:\n    $m_{Pi}c^2 = E_{mu} + E_{nu}$\n    $139.6 \\text{ MeV} = E_{mu} + E_{nu}$\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest mass (m) by the equation:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$\n\n    *   For the muon (mu+):\n        $E_{mu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n        $E_{mu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (105.7 \\text{ MeV})^2$\n\n    *   For the neutrino (nu), its rest mass is considered to be zero:\n        $E_{nu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (0)^2$\n        $E_{nu} = pc$\n\n4.  **Solving for the Energies:**\n    *   Substitute $E_{nu}$ into the energy equation for the muon:\n        $E_{mu}^2 = E_{nu}^2 + (105.7)^2$\n\n    *   From the conservation of energy equation, we have $E_{mu} = 139.6 - E_{nu}$. Substitute this into the equation above:\n        $(139.6 - E_{nu})^2 = E_{nu}^2 + (105.7)^2$\n\n    *   Expand the left side:\n        $(139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)E_{nu} + E_{nu}^2 = E_{nu}^2 + (105.7)^2$\n\n    *   The $E_{nu}^2$ terms cancel out. Rearrange to solve for $E_{nu}$:\n        $(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = 2(139.6)E_{nu}$\n        $E_{nu} = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n        $E_{nu} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2}$\n        $E_{nu} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n    **$KE_{nu} = 29.78$ MeV**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energy of the Muon (mu+):**\n    *   First, find the total energy of the muon:\n        $E_{mu} = 139.6 - E_{nu} = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    *   The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy:\n        $KE_{mu} = E_{mu} - m_{mu}c^2$\n        $KE_{mu} = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    *   **$KE_{mu} = 4.12$ MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches the values provided in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
