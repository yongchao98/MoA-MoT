    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Observational Constraints\n\nFirst, we need to determine the conditions a star must meet to be observed by both ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory and HIRES at Keck Observatory.\n\n**A. Magnitude Limits:**\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal):** Can observe stars brighter than an apparent V magnitude of 17. This means `V < 17.0`.\n*   **HIRES (Keck):** Can observe stars brighter than an apparent V magnitude of 16. This means `V < 16.0`.\n*   **For a star to be seen by both**, it must satisfy the stricter of the two limits, which is `V < 16.0`.\n\n**B. Visibility (Declination) Limits:**\nThe problem states to disregard pointing limits and altitudes, but the observatories' locations on Earth still restrict which parts of the sky they can see. A star is visible if it rises above the horizon.\n*   **Keck Observatory:** Located at a latitude (φ) of approximately +19.8° N. A star at declination (DEC) is visible if `DEC > φ - 90°`.\n    `DEC > 19.8° - 90°` -> `DEC > -70.2°`\n*   **Paranal Observatory:** Located at a latitude (φ) of approximately -24.6° S. A star is visible if `DEC < -φ + 90°`.\n    `DEC < -(-24.6°) + 90°` -> `DEC < 24.6° + 90°` -> `DEC < 114.6°`. This is not a strong constraint. A better physical constraint for southern observatories looking north is that the star must actually rise. The general condition `δ > φ - 90` also applies. But for practical purposes, we are interested in the declination limit in the opposite direction. An object at declination δ will rise above the horizon at a site with latitude φ if `cos(Hour Angle) = -tan(φ)tan(δ)` has a solution, which implies that the star is not circumpolar in the opposite hemisphere. The limit is `DEC < 90° - |φ|` for a northern hemisphere site, and `DEC > -(90° - |φ|)` for a southern hemisphere site. A simpler rule is that a star at declination `δ` rises for an observer at latitude `φ` if `δ > φ - 90` and sets if `δ < 90 - φ`.\n    Let's use the condition that for an observer at latitude `φ`, the declination range of stars that rise and set is between `φ - 90°` and `90° - φ`.\n    - For Keck (φ ≈ +20°): The range is between -70° and +70°.\n    - For Paranal (φ ≈ -25°): The range is between -115° and +65°.\n    The common visibility window is the intersection, which is approximately **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\n**Summary of Conditions for a star to be detected by BOTH:**\n1.  **Declination:** `-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°`\n2.  **Apparent Magnitude:** `V < 16.0`\n\n### 2. Evaluating Each Star\n\nWe will use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (V) when the absolute magnitude (M) is given:\n`V = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nWhere `d` is the distance in parsecs and `A_V` is the extinction in the V-band. `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n---\n**Star 1:**\n*   DEC = -75°.\n*   **Visibility Check:** -75° is not greater than -70.2°. It is not visible from Keck.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n**Star 2:**\n*   DEC = +55°.\n*   **Visibility Check:** `-70.2° < 55° < +65.4°`. Visible from both.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** `V = 16.5` (given). This does not satisfy `V < 16.0`. It is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n**Star 3:**\n*   DEC = +48°.\n*   **Visibility Check:** `-70.2° < 48° < +65.4°`. Visible from both.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** `V = 15.5` (given as apparent magnitude). This satisfies `V < 16.0`. The extra information about extinction (`E(B-V)`) is likely extraneous, as \"apparent magnitude\" refers to the value observed from Earth.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n---\n**Star 4:**\n*   DEC = -48°.\n*   **Visibility Check:** `-70.2° < -48° < +65.4°`. Visible from both.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** We must calculate V.\n    *   M = 15.5, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4.\n    *   `A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag.\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74`.\n    *   `V = 16.74`. This does not satisfy `V < 16.0`. It is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n**Star 5:**\n*   DEC = +60°.\n*   **Visibility Check:** `-70.2° < 60° < +65.4°`. Visible from both.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** We must calculate V.\n    *   M = 16.5, d = 5 pc, A_V = 0.\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995`.\n    *   `V ≈ 15.0`. This satisfies `V < 16.0`.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, Star 3 and Star 5 are the only stars that are visible from both observatories and are bright enough to be detected by both spectrographs.\n\nI will use Python to confirm the calculations.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Observatory Parameters ---\nlat_keck = 19.8  # degrees N\nmag_limit_hires = 16.0\nmag_limit_espresso = 17.0\n\n# --- Functions ---\ndef check_star(name, dec, V_app):\n    \"\"\"Checks a star's visibility and magnitude.\"\"\"\n    vis_keck = dec > (lat_keck - 90)\n    vis_paranal = dec < (90 - 24.6)\n    \n    mag_ok_hires = V_app < mag_limit_hires\n    \n    can_be_observed_by_both = vis_keck and vis_paranal and mag_ok_hires\n    \n    print(f\"--- Checking {name} ---\")\n    print(f\"DEC: {dec} -> Visible from both? {'Yes' if vis_keck and vis_paranal else 'No'}\")\n    print(f\"Vmag: {V_app:.2f} -> Bright enough for HIRES (V < 16.0)? {'Yes' if mag_ok_hires else 'No'}\")\n    print(f\"Result: {'Can be detected' if can_be_observed_by_both else 'Cannot be detected'}\")\n    return can_be_observed_by_both\n\n# --- Star Calculations & Checks ---\n# Star 1: DEC = -75, V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10)-5 = 15.5\ncheck_star('Star1', -75, 15.5)\n\n# Star 2: DEC = 55, V = 16.5\ncheck_star('Star2', 55, 16.5)\n\n# Star 3: DEC = 48, V = 15.5\ncheck_star('Star3', 48, 15.5)\n\n# Star 4: DEC = -48, V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10)-5 + 3.1*0.4 = 16.74\ncheck_star('Star4', -48, 16.74)\n\n# Star 5: DEC = 60, V = 16.5 + 5*log10(5)-5 = 14.995\ncheck_star('Star5', 60, 16.5 + 5*math.log10(5) - 5)\n\n```\n>>>\n--- Checking Star1 ---\nDEC: -75 -> Visible from both? No\nVmag: 15.50 -> Bright enough for HIRES (V < 16.0)? Yes\nResult: Cannot be detected\n--- Checking Star2 ---\nDEC: 55 -> Visible from both? Yes\nVmag: 16.50 -> Bright enough for HIRES (V < 16.0)?

    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we need to check two main criteria for each star:\n1.  **Visibility from both observatories:** The star's declination (DEC) must be in a range visible from both the W. M. Keck Observatory (Northern Hemisphere) and the Paranal Observatory (Southern Hemisphere).\n2.  **Apparent Magnitude Limit:** The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the limits of both instruments. The stricter limit will apply to both.\n\n### Step 1: Establish the Observational Criteria\n\n*   **Magnitude Limit:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (Paranal): `V < 17`\n    *   HIRES (Keck): `V < 16`\n    *   For a star to be seen by both, it must satisfy the stricter limit: **`V < 16.0`**.\n\n*   **Visibility (Declination) Limit:**\n    *   The W. M. Keck Observatory is at latitude ~ +19.8° N. Stars visible from Keck must have a declination greater than `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`.\n    *   The Paranal Observatory is at latitude ~ -24.6° S. Stars visible from Paranal must have a declination less than `-24.6° + 90° = 114.6°`. More practically, the best northern declination it can see well is limited by the atmosphere, approximately `90° - 24.6° = 65.4°`.\n    *   Therefore, the common observable declination range is approximately **`-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°`**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe will use the distance modulus formula to calculate the apparent magnitude `V` when the absolute magnitude `M` is given: `V = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `d` is distance in parsecs and `A_V` is the V-band extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the visible range for Keck (`DEC > -70.2°`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = 55°. This is within the common observable range.\n    *   **Magnitude:** V = 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the HIRES limit (`V < 16.0`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Visibility:** RA = 11 h is `11 * 15 = 165` deg. DEC = 48°. This is within the common observable range.\n    *   **Magnitude:** Apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the limit (`15.5 < 16.0`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -48°. This is within the common observable range.\n    *   **Magnitude:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude `V`.\n        *   M = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag.\n        *   `A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag.\n        *   `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag.\n        *   This is fainter than the HIRES limit (`16.74 > 16.0`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Visibility:** RA = 10 h is `10 * 15 = 150` deg. DEC = 60°. This is within the common observable range.\n    *   **Magnitude:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude `V`.\n        *   M = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc, no extinction mentioned (`A_V = 0`).\n        *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995` mag.\n        *   This is brighter than the limit (`14.995 < 16.0`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\nBased on this analysis, Star 3 and Star 5 are the only two that meet both the visibility and magnitude requirements for both observatories.\n\n<<<B>>>"
