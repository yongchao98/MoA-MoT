    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves two key concepts:\n    *   **Particle Decay:** Unstable particles decay over time following an exponential law. The number of particles `N` remaining after a time `t` from an initial sample `N₀` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's proper mean lifetime (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving particle's internal \"clock\" runs slower than a stationary observer's clock. The time `t_lab` that passes in the lab frame is related to the time `t_particle` that passes for the particle by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_particle`.\n\n2.  **Set up the Equation:**\n    *   The particles are created at the center and travel to the detector wall, a distance `R = 30 m`.\n    *   They travel at ultra-relativistic speeds, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time this takes in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The time that passes in the particle's own reference frame (the proper time during which it can decay) is `t_particle = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n    *   The fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall is `N/N₀`. We substitute `t_particle` into the decay equation:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-t_particle / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Relationship:**\n    *   The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for a given particle type and detector size. Let's call this constant `K`. So, the equation is `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   We can find a relationship between the two scenarios given in the problem. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(N/N₀) = -K / γ`\n        `γ * ln(N/N₀) = -K`\n        Or, `γ * [-ln(N/N₀)] = K`\n    *   Since `K` is a constant, this means the product `γ * [-ln(N/N₀)]` must be the same for both scenarios.\n        `γ₁ * [-ln(N₁/N₀)] = γ₂ * [-ln(N₂/N₀)]`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Fraction of survivors, `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   `γ₂ = ?`\n        *   Fraction of survivors, `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n\n    *   Plug these values into the relationship we derived:\n        `20 * [-ln(1/3)] = γ₂ * [-ln(2/3)]`\n        The property of logarithms states that `-ln(x) = ln(1/x)`.\n        `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    *   Now, isolate `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a simple calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ngamma_1 = 20\nfraction_1 = 1/3\nfraction_2 = 2/3\n\n# From the derived relationship: gamma_2 = gamma_1 * (-ln(fraction_1)) / (-ln(fraction_2))\n# -ln(1/3) = ln(3)\n# -ln(2/3) = ln(3/2)\n# gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_output>\n54.18985161395029\n</execute_output>\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Comparing the result with the given options:\n    A) 54\n    B) 40\n    C) 68\n    D) 28\n\n    The calculated value is closest to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>",
