    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the eigenvector.\n\n1.  **Identify the Operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ as:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    These are the standard spin-1/2 operators, where $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, this corresponds to an azimuthal angle $\\phi = 0$. The angle with the positive z-axis is the polar angle $\\theta$.\n    The unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in Cartesian coordinates is:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$\n    For $\\phi=0$, this becomes:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along the Direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$, denoted as $P_n$, is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components:\n    $P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, substitute the matrix forms of the Pauli matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right]$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\\\ 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + (-1) \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components:**\n    We can cancel the $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ factor from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve the first equation for the ratio of $b$ to $a$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    Using the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    Substituting these into the equation:\n    $b \\cdot [2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)] = a \\cdot [2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)]$\n    Assuming $\\theta \\neq 0$ (so $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $2\\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    $b = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    So, the eigenvector has the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can choose $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$ to simplify the form (this is an unnormalized choice).\n    If $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$, then $b = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    The normalization condition is that the sum of the squared magnitudes of the components is 1.\n    Normalization factor $N$: $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n    $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n    The eigenvector is already normalized.\n\n    Thus, the normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
