    "*   **1. Understanding the Goal:** The main goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 (T_eq4) and Planet 2 (T_eq2).\n\n*   **2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) / (2 * a^2) * R_star^2 )^(1/4)\n    Which simplifies to:\n    T_eq ∝ ( (1-A) / a )^(1/2)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's temperature (constant for the system).\n    *   R_star is the star's radius (constant for the system).\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n    *   `a` is the planet's semi-major axis (distance from the star for a circular orbit).\n\n*   **3. Formulating the Temperature Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ ( (1-A_4) / a_4 )^(1/2) ] / [ ( (1-A_2) / a_2 )^(1/2) ]\n\n*   **4. Simplifying with Given Information:**\n    *   The problem states that all planets have the same albedo, so A_4 = A_2. This means the (1-A) terms cancel out.\n    *   The simplified ratio becomes: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1 / a_4)^(1/2) / (1 / a_2)^(1/2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2).\n\n*   **5. Relating Distance to Orbital Period (Kepler's Third Law):** We don't have the distances (semi-major axes), but we have the orbital periods (P). Kepler's Third Law for planets orbiting the same star states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (P² ∝ a³).\n    *   Therefore, (P_4 / P_2)² = (a_4 / a_2)³.\n    *   We can rearrange this to find the ratio of the distances: a_4 / a_2 = (P_4 / P_2)^(2/3).\n    *   We need the inverse ratio for our temperature formula: a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3).\n\n*   **6. Substituting back into the Temperature Ratio:** Now we substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law back into our simplified temperature ratio:\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2) = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2).\n    *   The powers multiply: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2)) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3).\n\n*   **7. Using the Given Period Ratios:** The problem provides the orbital period ratios as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5.\n    *   Period of Planet 2 (P_2) corresponds to the ratio value 2.\n    *   Period of Planet 4 (P_4) corresponds to the ratio value 3.5.\n    *   So, the ratio P_2 / P_4 is 2 / 3.5.\n\n*   **8. Final Calculation:** We compute the final value using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Ratio of the orbital periods P2 / P4\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
