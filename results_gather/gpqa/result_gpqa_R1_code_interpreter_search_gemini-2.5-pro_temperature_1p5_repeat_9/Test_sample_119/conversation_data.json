    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the distribution of stars as a function of their parallax, `plx`. Specifically, it wants to know how `dN/d(plx)`, the number of stars (`N`) per unit interval of parallax, depends on the parallax value itself.\n\n2.  **State the Assumptions:** The core assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in three-dimensional space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere.\n\n3.  **Relate Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Consider a large sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer. The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd^3`.\n    *   The total number of stars `N` inside this sphere is the volume multiplied by the constant density `ρ`: `N(d) = ρ * V = (4/3)πρd^3`.\n    *   Now, consider a thin spherical shell at distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell, `dV`, is the surface area of the sphere (`4πd^2`) times the thickness (`dd`): `dV = 4πd^2 dd`.\n    *   The number of stars `dN` within this thin shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd^2 dd`.\n    *   This equation gives us the number of stars found in the distance interval `[d, d + dd]`.\n\n4.  **Introduce Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`d`). The standard definition is `d = 1/plx`, where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds. We are interested in the proportionality, so we can write `d ∝ 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to express `dN` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)` instead of `d` and `dd`. This requires a change of variables.\n\n5.  **Perform the Change of Variables:**\n    *   We start with the relationship `d = 1/plx = plx^{-1}`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the differentials `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [plx^{-1}] = -1 * plx^{-2} = -1/plx^2`.\n    *   This means `dd = (-1/plx^2) d(plx)`. When we consider the number of stars in a parallax bin of a certain width `d(plx)`, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just signifies that as one variable increases, the other decreases).\n        `dd = (1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Now, we take our expression for `dN` from step 3: `dN = 4πρd^2 dd`.\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx^2) d(plx)` into this equation.\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) d(plx)`\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d(plx)`\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx^4) d(plx)`\n    *   The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`.\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx^4`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the relationship is:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
