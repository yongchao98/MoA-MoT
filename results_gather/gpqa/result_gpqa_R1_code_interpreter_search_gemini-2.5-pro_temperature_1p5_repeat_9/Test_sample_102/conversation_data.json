    "This problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. This involves planning a multi-step synthesis, paying close attention to the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has a benzene ring with three substituents:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three groups are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each group directs incoming electrophiles:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe key to designing the synthesis is to introduce the groups in an order that utilizes their directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern. Since all groups are *meta* to each other, a good strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-director, and then add the other substituents.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   Step ii: Bromobenzene → Nitration. The -NO2 group will be directed to the *ortho* and *para* positions. The major product is p-bromonitrobenzene (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene). This 1,4-substitution pattern is incorrect for building a 1,3,5-substituted product. This sequence will not lead to the desired product in high yield.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction).\n*   Step iii & iv: Aniline → Diazonium salt → Benzene (deamination).\n*   This sequence converts benzene to aniline and then back to benzene. It does not lead to the target molecule. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   Step iii: Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This reaction fails. The amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents the acylation reaction. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\nLet's analyze the crucial first three steps:\n*   **Step i: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acetyl group (-COCH3). This is an excellent first step because the acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n*   **Step ii: Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** This is an electrophilic bromination. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (C3), giving the desired 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   **Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** This is an electrophilic nitration. We now have two groups on the ring: -COCH3 at C1 (*meta*-director) and -Br at C3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   In cases of conflicting directors, we analyze the positions. Position C5 is meta to the strong deactivating -COCH3 group. Positions C4 and C6 are ortho/para to the -Br group. While a mixture might be expected, the directing effect of the acetyl group is strong, and nitration at C5 is the major pathway, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This route correctly installs all three substituents with the correct 1,3,5-regiochemistry.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv-vii) in option B appear to be nonsensical and would not be performed after the target molecule has already been synthesized in step iii. They are likely included as distractors or are an error in the question. However, the initial sequence of reactions (i, ii, iii) is the only chemically sound and high-yield pathway to the target molecule among the choices.\n\nTherefore, the sequence beginning with acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration is the correct approach.\n\n<<<B>>>"
