    "The Mott-Gurney equation is a fundamental model describing space-charge-limited current (SCLC). To determine the correct conditions for its validity, let's break down the physical assumptions behind its derivation.\n\n1.  **Nature of Current:** The model describes a current that is limited not by the injection of carriers from the contact, but by the build-up of charge (a \"space charge\") within the semiconductor material itself. This space charge creates an electric field that opposes the further injection of carriers.\n\n2.  **Carrier Type:** The simplest form of the Mott-Gurney law assumes that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is mobile and contributes to the current. Therefore, it applies to a **single-carrier device**.\n\n3.  **Carrier Traps:** The ideal Mott-Gurney law ($J \\propto V^2$) is derived for a perfect insulator or semiconductor with no electronic trap states within the bandgap. If traps are present, they capture some of the injected carriers, and the relationship between J and V becomes more complex. Thus, the model is for a **trap-free** device.\n\n4.  **Contacts:** For a space charge to build up, the contact must be able to supply more carriers than the bulk of the device can transport. This requires an **Ohmic contact**, which is a contact with no energy barrier to charge injection. A Schottky contact, by contrast, has a rectifying barrier and would limit the current by injection, not by space-charge effects. Therefore, the model requires an Ohmic contact, which can also be described as having **no carrier injection barrier**.\n\n5.  **Transport Mechanism:** The model assumes that carriers move across the device due to the electric field created by the applied voltage. This is called **drift** current. The current due to the random thermal motion and concentration gradients (**diffusion** current) is assumed to be small in comparison and is therefore neglected. So, the equation is valid when **diffusion current is negligible**.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on these five points:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This is incorrect because the basic Mott-Gurney law applies to a **single-carrier** device.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n    *   This is incorrect. SCLC is a **drift-dominated** phenomenon. The assumption is that *diffusion* current is negligible, not drift current.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This statement is correct. It includes all the key assumptions:\n        *   \"trap-free single-carrier device\"\n        *   \"no carrier injection barrier\" (which is the definition of a perfect Ohmic contact for SCLC)\n        *   \"negligible diffusion current\"\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This is incorrect because a **Schottky contact** is a rectifying contact that limits carrier injection, preventing the formation of the space-charge-limited condition. SCLC requires an injecting Ohmic contact.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement describing the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
