    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which are PO₄³⁻, in the given solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of the Solution:**\n    *   Solvent: Water (implied)\n    *   Volume: 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n    *   Solute 1: 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (Potassium dihydrogen phosphate). Molar mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Solute 2: 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (Disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate). Molar mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol.\n\n3.  **Determine the Species in Solution:**\n    *   KH₂PO₄ is a salt that dissociates completely in water: KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻. So, we have H₂PO₄⁻ ions.\n    *   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is also a salt that dissociates completely: Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ + 2H₂O. So, we have HPO₄²⁻ ions.\n    *   The ions K⁺ and Na⁺ are spectator ions and do not participate in the acid-base equilibria.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molar Concentrations of the Key Species:**\n    *   First, calculate the moles of each solute.\n        *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. This gives the moles of H₂PO₄⁻.\n        *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. This gives the moles of HPO₄²⁻.\n    *   Next, calculate the initial molar concentrations ([ ]) using the volume of the solution (0.200 L).\n        *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ / 0.200 L\n        *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles of HPO₄²⁻ / 0.200 L\n\n5.  **Identify the Relevant Equilibria:**\n    The solution contains a conjugate acid-base pair: H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). This constitutes a buffer solution. The equilibria for phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) are:\n    *   H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ ;  Kₐ₁ = 7.5x10⁻³\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ ;  Kₐ₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻  ;  Kₐ₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\n    *   The primary equilibrium that determines the pH of this buffer is the second dissociation, governed by Kₐ₂.\n    *   The ion we need to find, PO₄³⁻, is produced in the third dissociation, governed by Kₐ₃.\n\n6.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   **Step A:** Calculate the initial concentrations of [H₂PO₄⁻] and [HPO₄²⁻].\n    *   **Step B:** Use the second dissociation equilibrium (Kₐ₂) and the concentrations from Step A to find the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺]. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is not strictly necessary; we can use the Kₐ₂ expression directly:\n        Kₐ₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n        From this, we can solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Kₐ₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   **Step C:** Use the third dissociation equilibrium (Kₐ₃) and the calculated [H⁺] to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻].\n        Kₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n        From this, we can solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Note: The concentrations of HPO₄²⁻ and H₂PO₄⁻ will change slightly due to the equilibria, but since Kₐ₂ and Kₐ₃ are very small, this change is negligible. We can use their initial calculated concentrations in the equations.\n\n7.  **Execute the Plan with Calculations:**\n    I will use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99 # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step A: Calculate initial concentrations\n# Moles of H2PO4- from KH2PO4\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\n# Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4.2H2O\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Initial concentrations\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step B: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step C: Calculate the orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4^3-] is: {conc_PO4_3minus:.2e} M\")\n```\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
