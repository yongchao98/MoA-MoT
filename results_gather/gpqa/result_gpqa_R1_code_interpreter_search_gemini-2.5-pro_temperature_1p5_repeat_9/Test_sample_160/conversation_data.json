    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Define λ1\n\n*   **Scenario:** The system initially contains only residual gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr) inside a TEM sample compartment.\n*   **λ1:** This is the mean free path (MFP) of these gas molecules colliding *with each other*.\n*   **Formula for λ1:** The standard formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other identical molecules is:\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the kinetic scattering cross-section for gas-gas collisions (related to the molecule's physical size).\n    *   The `√2` factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also in motion.\n*   **Magnitude of λ1:** In an ultra-high vacuum, the number density `n` is extremely low. This means that collisions between gas molecules are very rare, and consequently, λ1 is a very large distance (often hundreds of meters or even kilometers).\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Second State and Define λ2\n\n*   **Scenario:** An electron beam is initiated. The system now contains the residual gas molecules plus a beam of high-energy (1000 kV) electrons.\n*   **The \"Intriguing Observation\":** Mike observes a new mean free path, λ2, which is different from λ1. The term \"intriguing\" suggests a non-obvious physical phenomenon.\n*   **Interpreting λ2:** The phrase \"mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules\" is crucial. There are two possible interpretations:\n    1.  λ2 is the MFP of the *beam electrons* as they travel through the gas.\n    2.  λ2 is the new MFP of the *gas molecules*, which are now being constantly bombarded by the electron beam.\n\n    Let's analyze which interpretation makes the observation \"intriguing.\"\n    *   **Interpretation 1:** For a TEM to work, the MFP of beam electrons must be very long to allow them to reach the sample without scattering. Discovering that the electron MFP is very long would be expected, not intriguing.\n    *   **Interpretation 2:** The idea that turning on the beam profoundly changes the environment for the gas molecules themselves, altering their behavior and MFP, is a much more subtle and \"intriguing\" physical consequence. This interpretation is more likely the intended meaning.\n\n    Therefore, we will proceed with **λ2 as the mean free path of a gas molecule in the presence of the electron beam.**\n\n### 3. Analyze the New Collision Environment for a Gas Molecule\n\n*   With the beam on, a gas molecule can now collide with two types of particles:\n    1.  Other gas molecules (as before).\n    2.  Electrons from the beam.\n*   The total collision rate (ν_total) for a gas molecule is the sum of the rates of these two types of collisions:\n    ν_total = ν_gas-gas + ν_gas-electron\n*   The new mean free path, λ2, is the average velocity of the gas molecule divided by this new total collision rate:\n    λ₂ = v_gas / ν_total = v_gas / (ν_gas-gas + ν_gas-electron)\n*   Since the original MFP was λ₁ = v_gas / ν_gas-gas, we can see that if ν_gas-electron > 0, then ν_total > ν_gas-gas, which directly implies that **λ₂ < λ₁**.\n\n### 4. Quantify the Collision Rates to Confirm the Conclusion\n\nTo be certain, let's compare the magnitude of the two collision rates.\n*   **Gas-Gas collision rate:** ν_gas-gas = n * σ_gg * v_relative_gg ≈ n * σ_gg * v_gas * √2\n*   **Gas-Electron collision rate:** ν_gas-electron = ρ_e * σ_ge * v_relative_ge\n    *   `ρ_e` is the number density of electrons in the beam.\n    *   `σ_ge` is the cross-section for a gas molecule-electron collision.\n    *   `v_relative_ge` is the relative velocity. Since the electrons are relativistic (~0.94c) and the gas molecules are slow (thermal velocities, ~500 m/s), the relative velocity is completely dominated by the electron's velocity: `v_relative_ge ≈ v_electron`.\n\nLet's compare ν_gas-electron with ν_gas-gas.\nThe ratio is (ρ_e * σ_ge * v_electron) / (n * σ_gg * v_gas * √2).\n\nLet's evaluate the terms:\n*   **Densities (ρ_e vs. n):** Even in UHV (n ≈ 10¹³ molecules/m³), the density of electrons in a focused TEM beam is extremely high (ρ_e can be > 10¹⁸ electrons/m³). So, **ρ_e >> n**.\n*   **Velocities (v_electron vs. v_gas):** A 1 MeV electron has a velocity of ~2.8 x 10⁸ m/s, while a gas molecule has a thermal velocity of ~5 x 10² m/s. So, **v_electron >> v_gas**.\n*   **Cross-Sections (σ_ge vs. σ_gg):** The cross-section for a high-energy electron to scatter off a molecule (σ_ge) is generally *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section of two molecules colliding (σ_gg), because the atom is mostly empty space to a tiny, fast electron. However, this difference is completely overwhelmed by the vast differences in density and velocity.\n\nThe product (ρ_e * v_electron) is many, many orders of magnitude larger than the product (n * v_gas). This means:\n**ν_gas-electron >> ν_gas-gas**\n\nThe total collision rate is almost entirely determined by the collisions with the beam electrons (ν_total ≈ ν_gas-electron). Since this rate is vastly higher than the original gas-gas collision rate, the mean free path of the gas molecules must be drastically reduced.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe original mean free path λ1 was very large. When the electron beam is turned on, the gas molecules are subjected to a massive bombardment by high-density, high-velocity electrons. This introduces a new, dominant collision mechanism that dramatically increases the total collision frequency for each gas molecule. A higher collision frequency means a shorter average distance traveled between collisions.\n\nTherefore, the new mean free path, λ2, is significantly smaller than the original mean free path, λ1.\n\nλ₂ < λ₁\n\n<<<D>>>"
