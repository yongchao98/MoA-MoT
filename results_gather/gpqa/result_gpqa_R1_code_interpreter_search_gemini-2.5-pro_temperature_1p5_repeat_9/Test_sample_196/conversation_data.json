    "**1. Deciphering the Structure of Compound X from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The broad peak from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimeric form.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic (benzene) ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield, broad singlet for one proton is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded by the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the protons at 7.2 ppm are adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's piece together the remaining signals to identify the alkyl substituent.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a `CH₃CH₂-` fragment (part of an ethyl group).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-). This is a `CH₃-CH` fragment.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons. Based on the triplet at 0.9 ppm, this must be the methylene group (`-CH₂-`) of the ethyl fragment. It is adjacent to both the methyl group (3H) and another group (the methine, 1H), causing complex splitting (a multiplet).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton. Based on the doublet at 1.4 ppm, this must be the methine proton (`-CH-`). Its chemical shift indicates it's the benzylic proton (directly attached to the benzene ring). It is adjacent to the benzene ring, the methyl group (3H), and the methylene group (2H), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring with a -COOH group.\n        *   The other substituent is an alkyl group formed by connecting the fragments: The benzylic -CH is bonded to both a -CH₃ group and a -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl) group.\n        *   This structure is a sec-butyl group: `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`.\n    *   **Conclusion from NMR:** Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option C.\n\n**2. Determining the Reaction Product**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). It is one of the strongest methods for this transformation.\n*   **Applying the Reaction to Compound X:**\n    *   Starting Material (Compound X): 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The sec-butyl group on the ring will not be affected by these reagents.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   Final Product: The resulting molecule will have a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in a para (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring.\n    *   The name of the product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**3. Comparing with the Options**\n\n*   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches our deduced product.\n*   B) **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** The alkyl group is incorrect.\n*   C) **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material, not the final product.\n*   D) **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** This is a completely different isomeric structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
