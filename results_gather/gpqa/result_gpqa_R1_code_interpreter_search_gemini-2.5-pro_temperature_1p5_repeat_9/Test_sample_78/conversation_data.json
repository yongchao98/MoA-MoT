    "**1. Analysis of the Product from NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the reaction product from the provided ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The starting material is C11H12O. The reaction is a rearrangement/isomerization (common for epoxides with a base at high temperature), so the product will have the same formula, C11H12O.\n    *   Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   A signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a **ketone** (aldehydes are typically 190-200 ppm, but ketones are more common >195 ppm). This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Signals in the aromatic/alkene region (δ 126-145 ppm).\n    *   Two aliphatic signals at **δ 21.3** and **δ 28.4 ppm**, corresponding to methyl (-CH3) carbons.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**: This pattern (two doublets, each integrating to 2H) is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. A benzene ring accounts for four degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s)**: A methyl group singlet. Given the para-disubstituted ring, this is very likely a methyl group attached to the ring, forming a **p-tolyl group**. The chemical shift is typical for an aryl methyl group.\n    *   **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**: A second methyl group singlet. Since it's a singlet, it's attached to a carbon with no adjacent protons, likely a carbonyl group or a double bond. Given the ketone from ¹³C NMR, this is likely a **methyl ketone** moiety (`-C(=O)-CH₃`).\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**: These are two vinylic protons on a double bond (`-CH=CH-`). They are doublets because they are coupled to each other. This accounts for the final degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Let's put the pieces together:\n    1.  A p-tolyl group (`CH₃-C₆H₄-`).\n    2.  A methyl ketone group (`-C(=O)CH₃`).\n    3.  A trans `CH=CH` linker.\n\n    There are two ways to connect these:\n    *   `(p-tolyl)-C(=O)-CH=CH-CH₃` (Incorrect formula: C₁₁H₁₁O)\n    *   `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃` (Formula: C₁₁H₁₂O)\n\n    The correct structure is **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**. Let's verify the NMR assignments for this structure:\n    *   `p-tolyl-CH₃`: δ 2.28 (s)\n    *   `ketone-CH₃`: δ 2.31 (s)\n    *   `p-tolyl aromatic protons`: The two doublets at δ 7.08 and δ 7.71.\n    *   `vinylic protons`: The proton alpha to the carbonyl (`=CH-CO`) is shielded and appears upfield (δ 6.75), while the proton beta to the carbonyl (`Ar-CH=`) is deshielded and appears downfield (δ 7.68). This assignment is consistent with typical enone structures.\n    *   This structure accounts for all signals, integrations, and splitting patterns.\n\n**2. Identifying the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction transforms Compound X into (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. Since the reaction conditions (DABCO, heat) are for an isomerization and do not add or remove groups from the aromatic ring, the starting material (Compound X) must also contain a **p-tolyl group**.\n\nLet's examine the options provided for Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O):\n\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The `4-methylstyryl` group is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`. This molecule contains a p-tolyl group. Its structure is `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This is a plausible precursor.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Incorrect. (Also, its formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, not C₁₁H₁₂O).\n*   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Incorrect.\n\nOnly option B has the necessary p-tolyl backbone to form the identified product.\n\n**3. Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe conversion of 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane to (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one is a known type of base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyloxirane (an epoxide adjacent to a double bond).\n\n1.  **Proton Abstraction:** The base, DABCO, abstracts a proton from the terminal `-CH₂-` group of the epoxide ring. This is the most accessible, albeit not highly acidic, proton. The high temperature facilitates this step.\n    ` (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂ + B: → (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH⁻ + BH⁺ `\n2.  **Ring Opening/Elimination:** The resulting carbanion induces an elimination reaction. The electron pair from the C-H bond forms a new C=C bond, and the C-O bond of the epoxide cleaves, placing the negative charge on the oxygen. This forms an enolate anion.\n    ` (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH⁻ → (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(=CH₂)-O⁻ `\n3.  **Tautomerization:** The enolate is protonated (by `BH⁺` formed in step 1) to give an enol, which rapidly tautomerizes to the more stable ketone product.\n    ` (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(=CH₂)-O⁻ + BH⁺ → (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(OH)=CH₂ + B: `\n    ` (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(OH)=CH₂ (enol) ⇌ (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃ (ketone) `\n\nThis plausible mechanism connects the only possible starting material (B) to the product confirmed by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
