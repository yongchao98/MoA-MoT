    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK\n\nThis reaction is a **Michael addition**.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate this ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which is electrophilic at the β-carbon.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (the Nucleophile):**\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O group): C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-hydrogens. Therefore, it cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-hydrogen.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the only available α-carbon, which is C6, to form the corresponding enolate. This enolate is the nucleophile that will attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the cyclohexanone enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   The reaction proceeds via an enolate intermediate which is then protonated during the workup step (implicitly with a proton source like water or mild acid) to give the final stable product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The reaction adds an ethyl propanoate group (-CH₂CH₂COOEt) to the C6 position.\n    *   The resulting product structure is:\n        ```\n               Me Et\n               | /\n              (C2)----(C1=O)\n              /        \\\n            (C3)         (C6)-Me\n             \\          /  |\n              (C4)----(C5)  CH₂-CH₂-COOEt\n        ```\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the ester. The parent chain is an ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on this chain.\n    *   The propanoate chain is numbered `EtOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH₃(3)`. The cyclohexyl substituent is attached at position 3.\n    *   Now, we name the cyclohexyl substituent. The point of attachment to the main chain is assigned as C1 of the ring.\n        *   The original C6 becomes the new C1 (which has a methyl group).\n        *   The original C1 (with C=O) becomes the new C2 (hence, 2-oxo).\n        *   The original C2 (with ethyl and methyl) becomes the new C3 (hence, 3-ethyl-3-methyl).\n    *   Combining the substituent names alphabetically gives: **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH, H₂O\n\nThis is also a **Michael addition**.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the α-hydrogens (on the carbon attached to NO₂) acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the 1-nitropropane.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Carbanion (the Nucleophile):**\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n    *   CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ → CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂ + H₂O\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water (H₂O) to yield the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The structure of the product is formed by connecting the C1 of 1-nitropropane to the C3 of the butene chain:\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). This defines the parent chain as a hexanenitrile (6 carbons in the longest chain including the nitrile carbon).\n    *   Number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nThe correct choice is the one that matches both product names.\n\n<<<A>>>"
