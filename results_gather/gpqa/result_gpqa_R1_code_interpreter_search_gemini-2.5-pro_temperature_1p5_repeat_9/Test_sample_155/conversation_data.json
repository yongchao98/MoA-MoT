    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the reactions and the subsequent HPLC analysis.\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene which is achiral. The structure is CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃, with the two propyl groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a **syn-addition**, meaning the two new C-O bonds are formed on the same face of the original double bond.\n    *   Since (E)-oct-4-ene is planar, the mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from the top face and attack from the bottom face produce non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n    *   Therefore, the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Step 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺) Treatment.** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (Sₙ2-style) attack by a water molecule on one of the epoxide carbons. This results in an **anti-addition** of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original C-C bond of the epoxide.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of one of the enantiomers, say (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at carbon 4 (which has R configuration) leads to inversion of stereochemistry at that carbon, resulting in an S configuration. The configuration at carbon 5 (R) remains unchanged. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at carbon 5 (which has R configuration) leads to inversion at C5, resulting in an S configuration. The configuration at carbon 4 (R) remains unchanged. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The products (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a **meso compound**.\n    *   Performing the same analysis on the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, also yields the same meso-diol.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is the single, achiral **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene which is achiral. The two propyl groups are on the same side of the double bond.\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA (syn-addition).**\n    *   When (Z)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized, the resulting epoxide will have the two propyl groups on the same side of the ring (a cis-epoxide).\n    *   This cis-epoxide has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C4-C5 bond and passing through the oxygen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a single **meso compound**: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Step 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺) Treatment (anti-addition).**\n    *   We now perform an acid-catalyzed ring-opening on the meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The two carbons (C4 and C5) are enantiotopic, meaning attack at either carbon is equally likely.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at carbon 4 (R configuration) causes inversion, leading to the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at carbon 5 (S configuration) causes inversion, leading to the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the attack is equally probable at both sites, they are formed in equal amounts.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Part 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nNote that the meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Part 4: HPLC Analysis**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC separates molecules based on physical properties like polarity and size.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   In our mixture, the two enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diol) will co-elute as one peak. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair, will have different properties and will elute as a separate peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, which have different energies and stabilities.\n    *   Since chiral HPLC can separate enantiomers, it can certainly also separate diastereomers.\n    *   It will resolve all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-diol, and one for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
