    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion from the experimental data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Role of G2**\n\n*   **Single mutant `g2`:** A knockout of the G2 gene results in 0% resistance. This is the most severe phenotype possible, a complete loss of function.\n*   **Double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3`:** The resistance levels for both `g1g2` and `g2g3` are also 0%.\n*   **Conclusion:** When the phenotype of a double mutant (e.g., `g2g3`) is the same as the phenotype of one of the single mutants (`g2`), the gene from the single mutant (G2) is said to be **epistatic** to the other gene (G3). This means G2's function is masking the function of G1 and G3. A common biological reason for this is that G2 is an upstream regulator in the pathway. Since the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor, and G2 is essential for any resistance to occur, **G2 is the most likely candidate for the transcription factor** that regulates the expression of G1 and G3. If G2 is absent, G1 and G3 are not expressed (or their pathway is non-functional), so knocking them out makes no additional difference.\n\n**2. Analyze the Relationship between G1 and G3**\n\n*   **Single mutant `g1`:** Results in 75% resistance (a loss of 25%).\n*   **Single mutant `g3`:** Results in 50% resistance (a loss of 50%).\n*   **Double mutant `g1g3`:** Results in 10% resistance (a loss of 90%).\n*   **Analysis:** If the genes acted independently, we would expect an additive effect. The combined loss of resistance would be the sum of individual losses: 25% + 50% = 75% loss, leading to 25% remaining resistance.\n*   **Observation:** The actual resistance of the `g1g3` double mutant is 10%, which is significantly lower than the expected 25%. This much stronger effect in the double mutant is called a **synergistic interaction**. This type of interaction is a classic sign of **gene redundancy**, where G1 and G3 have partially overlapping or parallel functions contributing to the same outcome (resistance). The organism can compensate for the loss of one, but losing both is catastrophic.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Term \"Epistasis\" between G1 and G3**\n\n*   The term epistasis usually implies that one gene's phenotype completely masks another's. This isn't strictly what is happening between G1 and G3, as a new, more severe phenotype emerges. However, in the context of multiple-choice questions, we must select the best possible fit. The statement \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is less clear than the other conclusions, but let's evaluate the full options.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options**\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct**, as deduced in step 1.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: **Correct**, due to the synergistic interaction seen in step 2.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This is the weakest part, but the other two statements are strongly supported.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:**\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a possible mechanism but cannot be concluded from this data. They could have different promoters that are both activated by G2. This is an unsupported assumption.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measures one trait (disease resistance). There is no evidence for pleiotropy.\n\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: **Incorrect**. The `g1` mutant has a mild phenotype (75% resistance), whereas the `g2` mutant has a severe one (0%). If G1 were the transcription factor for G2, the `g1` phenotype should be at least as severe as the `g2` phenotype.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A contains two conclusions that are very strongly supported by the data (`G2 is a transcription factor` and `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`). The other options contain either incorrect statements (D) or unsubstantiated claims (B, C). Therefore, Option A is the best and most comprehensive conclusion that can be drawn from the experiment.\n\n<<<A>>>"
