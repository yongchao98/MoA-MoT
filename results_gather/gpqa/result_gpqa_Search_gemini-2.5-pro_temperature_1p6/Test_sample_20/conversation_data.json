    "### Analysis of the Compounds\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where structures can interconvert through the migration of a proton and a shift in a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbons that are alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds (sp² hybridized). While these carbons have hydrogen atoms, removing one is difficult. More importantly, a typical keto-enol tautomerization is not possible without disrupting the conjugated system in an energetically unfavorable way. Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses hydrogens on the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6. These carbons are alpha to the carbonyl groups. These alpha-hydrogens can be removed, and the compound can undergo tautomerization to form its enol counterpart, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound, which provides significant resonance stabilization. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily shows tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for (A):** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common source of chirality is a stereocenter, often a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since it is bonded to four distinct groups, this carbon is a chiral center. Molecules with a chiral center exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond. This molecule is planar around the double bond and has a center of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for (B):** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   Compound that does not show tautomerism (A) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound that will show optical isomerism (B) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
