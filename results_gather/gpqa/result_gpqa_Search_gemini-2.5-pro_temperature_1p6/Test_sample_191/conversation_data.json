    "This is a classic problem in electrostatics that demonstrates the principle of electrostatic shielding. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the spherical conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity until they create a total charge of `-q`. This happens because the electric field inside the material of a conductor must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface of the cavity, a net positive charge of `+q` must be left on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain its overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding and Charge Distribution:** The conductor effectively isolates the outside region from the electric fields originating inside the cavity. The charge `+q` on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge inside the cavity. Because the conductor's outer surface is perfectly spherical and there are no other external charges, this `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Applying Gauss's Law:** According to Gauss's Law (and the Shell Theorem), for any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge with the same total charge located at the sphere's center.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** The point P is outside the conductor. The electric field at P is therefore determined solely by the uniformly distributed charge `+q` on the outer surface. We can treat this charge as a single point charge `+q` located at the center of the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as `L`.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nAll the other information provided—such as the cavity's radius `r`, the separation of the centers `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `θ`—is extraneous and designed to distract from the core physical principle of electrostatic shielding. The external field depends only on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\n<<<C>>>"
