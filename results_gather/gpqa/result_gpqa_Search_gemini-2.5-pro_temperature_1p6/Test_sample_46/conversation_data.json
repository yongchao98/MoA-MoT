    "The provided spectral data points to a specific molecular structure. Here is a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n**Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n*   The medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O), specifically an ester, which typically absorbs in the 1750-1700 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates that this group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. Together, the triplet and quartet strongly suggest the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H):** A broad signal integrating to two protons in this region is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons, is a classic sign of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The doublet at the lower field (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the doublet at the higher field (7.0 ppm) is next to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region due to meta-substitution, not two doublets.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, also known as Benzocaine, perfectly aligns with all the spectral data. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a para-disubstituted benzene ring, which accounts for every signal in both the IR and NMR spectra.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This compound has a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only a single N-H stretch in the IR spectrum, not the two observed.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** While it has a primary amine and a para-substituted ring, the propionate group (-OCOCH₂CH₃) would show a quartet for the methylene group around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided data, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
