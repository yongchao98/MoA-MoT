    "A textile dye that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV will absorb red light. The color of light absorbed by a compound is complementary to the color of light it emits.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:** The energy of light (E) is inversely proportional to its wavelength (λ). The relationship can be expressed by the formula E = hc/λ, where 'h' is Planck's constant and 'c' is the speed of light. A common conversion is E (eV) ≈ 1240 / λ (nm).\n    *   Given the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV.\n    *   The wavelength (λ) is approximately 1240 / 2.3393 eV, which equals ~530 nm.\n\n2.  **Determine the color of the emitted light:** The visible light spectrum shows the relationship between wavelength and color. A wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the green region of the spectrum, which spans from about 495 nm to 566 nm. Therefore, the dye emits green light.\n\n3.  **Identify the absorbed color:** The color an object appears is the color of light it reflects or transmits, while it absorbs the other colors. The absorbed color is complementary to the emitted or reflected color. According to the traditional color model, red is the complementary color to green.\n\nSince the textile dye emits green light, it absorbs its complementary color, which is red.\n\n<<<A>>>"
