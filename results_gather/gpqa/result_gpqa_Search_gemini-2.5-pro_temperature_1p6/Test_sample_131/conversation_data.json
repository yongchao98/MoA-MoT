    "To determine which two compounds are present in the mixture, we need to analyze the provided 1H NMR data and compare it with the expected spectra for each of the candidate molecules.\n\n**1. Summary of the Experimental 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals (singlets) in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals (singlets) in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nFirst, we confirm that all four potential compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4):** 6 carbons + 4*(1 carbon) = 10 carbons. 2 hydrogens + 4*(3 hydrogens) = 14 hydrogens. Formula C10H14. This applies to 1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2):** 6 carbons + 2*(2 carbons) = 10 carbons. 4 hydrogens + 2*(5 hydrogens) = 14 hydrogens. Formula C10H14.\nAll candidates fit the molecular formula.\n\n**2. Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Each Compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signal:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule is less symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** It has two chemically non-equivalent aromatic protons (at positions 4 and 6). These are meta- to each other, so the coupling constant (⁴J) is very small (0-1 Hz), leading to two distinct singlets. Each integrates to 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** The four methyl groups are in four different chemical environments, giving rise to four separate singlets, each integrating to 3H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** The two aromatic protons (at positions 5 and 6) are adjacent (ortho). They are chemically non-equivalent and will split each other into a pair of doublets.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** Due to a plane of symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1-CH₃ is equivalent to C4-CH₃, and C2-CH₃ is equivalent to C3-CH₃). This results in two singlets, each integrating to 6H.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, producing one singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** It will show a quartet for the methylene (-CH₂-) protons and a triplet for the methyl (-CH₃) protons. These are not singlets.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mixture Described in the Problem:**\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on the mixture's spectrum. The key features are only singlets in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions. This immediately eliminates any option containing **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (which gives doublets) or **1,4-diethylbenzene** (which gives a quartet and a triplet).\n\n*   Option A contains 1,4-diethylbenzene. **Incorrect.**\n*   Option B contains 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. **Incorrect.**\n*   Option D contains 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. **Incorrect.**\n\nThis leaves only **Option C** as a possibility. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** matches the data.\n\n**Mixture: 1:1 ratio of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Compound A) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Compound B).**\n\n*   **Signals from Compound A (1,2,4,5-):**\n    *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H).\n    *   Aliphatic: 1 singlet (12H).\n*   **Signals from Compound B (1,2,3,5-):**\n    *   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1H each).\n    *   Aliphatic: 4 singlets (3H each).\n\n**Predicted Spectrum of the Mixture:**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** We expect three singlets in total: one 2H signal from Compound A and two 1H signals from Compound B. The experimental spectrum shows only two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. The total number of aromatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 2 (from A) + 2 (from B) = 4 protons. A 1:1 ratio for the observed signals means each signal corresponds to 2H.\n    *   **Signal 1 (2H):** This corresponds to the single aromatic signal of Compound A (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n    *   **Signal 2 (2H):** This signal must arise from the two non-equivalent 1H protons of Compound B (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene) being *accidentally degenerate*, meaning they happen to have the same chemical shift, thus appearing as a single peak with a combined integration of 2H.\n    This scenario perfectly explains the observation of two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 (i.e., 2H:2H) ratio.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** We expect five singlets in total: one 12H signal from Compound A and four 3H signals from Compound B. The experimental spectrum shows only three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This implies significant accidental degeneracy (signal overlap).\n    * Let the total number of aliphatic protons be 12 (from A) + 12 (from B) = 24 protons.\n    * The observed 2:1:1 ratio means the signals have relative integrations of 2x, 1x, and 1x, where 2x + 1x + 1x = 24H. This gives 4x = 24H, so x = 6H.\n    * The three observed singlets must therefore have integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    * This can be explained as follows:\n        * **Signal 1 (12H):** This corresponds to the single aliphatic signal from Compound A (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        * **Signal 2 (6H):** This arises from the accidental overlap of two of the four 3H signals from Compound B.\n        * **Signal 3 (6H):** This arises from the accidental overlap of the other two 3H signals from Compound B.\n    This combination of signals exactly matches the observed 2:1:1 integration ratio (12H:6H:6H).\n\nTherefore, a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, with the described accidental degeneracies, is fully consistent with the experimental NMR data.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
