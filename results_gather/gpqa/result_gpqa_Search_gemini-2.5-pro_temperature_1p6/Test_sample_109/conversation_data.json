    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Visibility**: The star must be visible from both observatory locations.\n2.  **Brightness**: The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the limit of *both* instruments.\n\n**Observatory Constraints:**\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (with ESPRESSO):**\n    *   Location: Atacama Desert, Chile (Southern Hemisphere, latitude approx. -24.6°).\n    *   Visibility Range: Can observe stars with declinations roughly between -90° and +65.4°.\n    *   Magnitude Limit: Apparent V magnitude < 17 mag.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (with HIRES):**\n    *   Location: Mauna Kea, Hawaii, USA (Northern Hemisphere, latitude approx. +19.8°).\n    *   Visibility Range: Can observe stars with declinations roughly between -70.2° and +90°.\n    *   Magnitude Limit: Apparent V magnitude < 16 V mag.\n\nFor a star to be observable by **both**, it must satisfy the stricter of these constraints:\n*   **Combined Visibility Range:** The declination (DEC) must be between approximately -70.2° and +65.4°.\n*   **Combined Magnitude Limit:** The apparent V magnitude must be < 16 mag.\n\n---\n\n### **Star-by-Star Analysis**\n\nWe use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (m_v) from the absolute magnitude (M_v), distance (d) in parsecs, and extinction (A_v):\n`m_v = M_v + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_v`\n\nThe visual extinction `A_v` is calculated from the color excess `E(B-V)`:\n`A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V)`\n\n**Star1**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the visible range for the Keck Observatory (-70.2° to +90°).\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star2**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = +55°. This is within the visible range for both observatories.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** `m_v = 16.5` mag.\n*   **Brightness Check:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (< 17 mag): 16.5 is OK.\n    *   HIRES (< 16 mag): 16.5 is **not** brighter than 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both (too faint for HIRES).\n\n**Star3**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = +48°. This is within the visible range for both observatories.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** The problem states an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag. This value is what would be observed from Earth. The additional information about extinction and distance is likely extraneous if the final apparent magnitude is given.\n*   **Brightness Check:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (< 17 mag): 15.5 is OK.\n    *   HIRES (< 16 mag): 15.5 is OK.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n**Star4**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = -48°. This is within the visible range for both observatories.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M_v) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   Extinction (A_v) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   Apparent Magnitude (m_v) = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**.\n*   **Brightness Check:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (< 17 mag): 16.74 is OK.\n    *   HIRES (< 16 mag): 16.74 is **not** brighter than 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both (too faint for HIRES).\n\n**Star5**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = +60°. This is within the visible range for both observatories.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M_v) = 16.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n    *   Extinction (A_v) = 0 (not mentioned)\n    *   Apparent Magnitude (m_v) = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**.\n*   **Brightness Check:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (< 17 mag): ~15.0 is OK.\n    *   HIRES (< 16 mag): ~15.0 is OK.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only Star3 and Star5 meet all the criteria for observation by both instruments.\n\n<<<C>>>"
