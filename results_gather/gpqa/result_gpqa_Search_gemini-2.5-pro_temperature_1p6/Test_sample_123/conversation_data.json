    "### Calculation of the Required Lorentz Factor\n\nThis problem can be solved by applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay. The fraction of particles that survive after traveling a certain distance is determined by their lifetime in the laboratory's frame of reference, which is lengthened by the Lorentz factor.\n\n#### Key Principles:\n\n1.  **Exponential Decay**: The decay of a population of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The fraction of particles, *N/N₀*, remaining after a time *t* in the lab frame is given by:\n    *N/N₀ = e<sup>(-t / T')</sup>*\n    where *T'* is the time-dilated mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation**: The mean lifetime of a relativistic particle as measured in the lab frame (*T'*) is longer than its proper lifetime (*τ₀*, its lifetime in its own rest frame). This relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor (γ):\n    *T' = γ * τ₀*\n\n3.  **Travel Time**: The particles are described as ultra-relativistic, meaning their velocity *v* is very close to the speed of light, *c*. The time (*t*) it takes for them to reach the detector wall of radius *R* is:\n    *t = R / v ≈ R / c*\n\nCombining these principles, the fraction (*F*) of particles that reach the detector is:\n*F = e<sup>(- (R/c) / (γτ₀))</sup>*\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\nln(*F*) = -*R* / (*cγτ₀*)\nor\n-γ * ln(*F*) = *R* / (*cτ₀*)\n\nSince the right side of the equation (*R / (cτ₀)*) consists of constants for this specific experimental setup, we can establish a relationship between the two scenarios.\n\n#### Scenario 1:\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, *F₁* = 1/3\n\nPlugging these values into the derived relation:\n-20 * ln(1/3) = *R* / (*cτ₀*)\n20 * ln(3) = *R* / (*cτ₀*)\n\n#### Scenario 2:\n*   Required Lorentz factor, γ₂ = ?\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, *F₂* = 2/3\n\nPlugging this into the relation:\n-γ₂ * ln(2/3) = *R* / (*cτ₀*)\nγ₂ * ln(3/2) = *R* / (*cτ₀*)\n\n#### Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):\n\nNow we have two expressions for the constant term *R / (cτ₀)*, so we can set them equal to each other:\n\n20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)\n\nSolving for γ₂:\nγ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))\nγ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)))\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(2) ≈ 0.6931):\n\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931))\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\nγ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 54. Therefore, a Lorentz factor of approximately 54 is needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector.\n\n<<<A>>>"
