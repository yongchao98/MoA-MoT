    "Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product:\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactant and Reagents\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure and Molecular Formula of the Reactant\n\nLet's break down the name to draw the structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group is the principal functional group, so it's at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO group is at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group is at position 5.\n\nBased on this, the molecular formula is **C10H12O3**.\n\nTo confirm, let's calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant:\n*   A ring counts as 1 IHD.\n*   Each double bond (C=C or C=O) counts as 1 IHD.\n*   The structure has: 1 ring, 1 C=C in the ring, 1 C=C in the vinyl group, 1 C=O in the formyl group, and 1 C=O in the carboxylic acid group.\n*   Total IHD of reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n### 3. Understand the Chemical Reaction\n\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent. This reagent is known to reduce several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   **Carboxylic acids (-COOH)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   **Aldehydes (-CHO)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   **Alcohols (-OH)** are reduced to alkanes (-H).\n*   **Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C)** are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\n### 4. Determine the Structure and Molecular Formula of the Product\n\nApplying the reductions to our reactant:\n*   The carboxylic acid group at C1 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at C2 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it is 1,2-dimethyl-4-ethylcyclohexane (note that IUPAC numbering for the product may differ, but the connectivity is what matters for the formula).\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the reactant (10 carbons) is preserved. All oxygen atoms are removed, and all double bonds are saturated with hydrogen. The resulting product is a cycloalkane.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of the product. The product is a substituted alkane with a single ring. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is **C10H20**.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as degrees of unsaturation) indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\nThe formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon (CxHy) is:\nIHD = (2C + 2 - H) / 2\n\nFor our product, C10H20:\nIHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = 2 / 2\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD by inspecting the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Each ring contributes one to the index of hydrogen deficiency. Therefore, the IHD is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
