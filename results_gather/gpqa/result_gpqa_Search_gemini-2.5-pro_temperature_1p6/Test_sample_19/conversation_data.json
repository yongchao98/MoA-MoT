    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations posits that the interaction with a nucleus can be treated as a sum of interactions with its individual nucleons, as if they were free particles. This approximation is based on a set of core assumptions about the nature of the interaction and the nuclear environment. A detailed analysis reveals that this approximation is jointly implied by the following three assumptions:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the foundational concept of the impulse approximation, often referred to as the \"single nucleon knockout\" model. It assumes that the incoming probe interacts with only one nucleon at a time. The total interaction is then the sum of these individual interactions.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption implies that neither the incoming probe before the interaction nor the outgoing particles after the interaction are significantly affected by the other nucleons in the nucleus. This is also described as the neglect of \"final state interactions.\"\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** The core idea is that the interaction happens over a very short timescale, an \"impulse,\" during which the influence of the nuclear potential that binds the nucleon is negligible. The nucleon is treated as a free particle at the moment of the collision.\n\nThe third statement provided in the question, \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic,\" is not a necessary condition for the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation itself treats nucleons as the fundamental degrees of freedom, and while relativistic treatments of the nucleons exist (Relativistic Impulse Approximation), the internal quark dynamics are a separate consideration related to nucleon structure models.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
