    "Based on the analysis of the reaction mechanisms and consultation of relevant chemical literature, the major products are determined as follows:\n\n**Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) ---> A**\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of a tandem anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement followed by a transannular cyclization.\n1.  **Alkoxide Formation:** The strong base, potassium hydride (KH), deprotonates the alcohol to form a potassium alkoxide.\n2.  **Anionic Oxy-Cope Rearrangement:** The resulting alkoxide is perfectly set up for a-sigmatropic rearrangement. This rearrangement is known to be extraordinarily accelerated by the negative charge on the oxygen (rates can be enhanced by a factor of 10¹⁰ to 10¹⁷). The reaction proceeds through a chair-like transition state, opening the strained cyclobutane ring to form a 10-membered ring enolate as an intermediate.\n3.  **Transannular Cyclization:** The 10-membered ring intermediate does not remain as such. Due to conformational flexibility, the enolate undergoes a subsequent intramolecular (transannular) reaction. For spirocyclic systems of this type, the reaction cascade is known to produce bridged bicyclic systems. Specifically, the rearrangement of similar vinyl spiro-alcohols is a known route to synthesize the bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane skeleton, a core structure found in natural products like taxol. This cascade ultimately yields **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) ---> B**\n\nThis reaction is an Ireland-Claisen rearrangement, a powerful method for C-C bond formation.\n1.  **Alkoxide and Ester Formation:** First, the lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) deprotonates the allylic alcohol. The resulting lithium alkoxide then reacts with acetyl bromide to form an allylic ester, (E)-pent-2-en-1-yl acetate.\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a very strong base and is present to drive the main rearrangement. It deprotonates the most acidic proton of the newly formed ester, which is on the methyl group of the acetyl function, to form a lithium enolate.\n3.  **-Sigmatropic Rearrangement:** This lithium enolate of the allylic ester undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement. This type of rearrangement is known to proceed readily at low temperatures. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the alpha-carbon of the original acetate group and the gamma-carbon of the original allyl group.\n4.  **Product:** The rearrangement produces the lithium salt of a γ,δ-unsaturated carboxylic acid. Tracing the atoms reveals the product to be `HOOC-CH₂–CH(Et)–CH=CH₂`, which is 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid. Since the reaction is carried out under basic conditions (LDA) and no acidic workup is specified in the options, the product remains as the salt, which is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n*   Product B is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
