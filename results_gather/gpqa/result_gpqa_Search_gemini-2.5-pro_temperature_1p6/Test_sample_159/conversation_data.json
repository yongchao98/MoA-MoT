    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the angular distance between the first two minima.\n\n1.  **Aperture Shape**: The problem begins with an N-sided polygonal aperture. When the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large, a regular polygon approaches the shape of a circle.\n2.  **Apothem**: The apothem 'a' is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side. As N approaches infinity, the apothem becomes the radius of the resulting circular aperture.\n3.  **Diffraction Pattern**: When monochromatic light with wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central spot, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima.\n4.  **Condition for Minima**: The angular positions of the minima in a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture are given by the formula:\n\n    sin(θ) ≈ θ = m * λ / d\n\n    where θ is the angular position of the minimum, λ is the wavelength of light, d is the diameter of the aperture, and m is a coefficient derived from the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The diameter d is twice the radius a, so d = 2a.\n\n    The minima occur at angles given by:\n\n    θ = (xₙ / π) * (λ / d) = (xₙ / 2π) * (λ / a)\n\n    where xₙ are the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n5.  **Locating the Minima**:\n    *   The **first minimum** corresponds to the first zero of the Bessel function J₁(x), which is approximately 3.8317. The angular position (θ₁) is:\n\n        θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * λ / a\n    *   The **second minimum** corresponds to the second zero of the Bessel function J₁(x), which is approximately 7.0156. The angular position (θ₂) is:\n\n        θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.117 * λ / a\n6.  **Calculating the Angular Distance**: The angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between their angular positions (Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁).\n\n    Δθ ≈ (1.117 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\n    Δθ ≈ (1.117 - 0.610) * (λ / a)\n    Δθ ≈ 0.507 * λ / a\n\nThis result is very close to 0.506 λ / a.\n\nTherefore, based on the calculation, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
