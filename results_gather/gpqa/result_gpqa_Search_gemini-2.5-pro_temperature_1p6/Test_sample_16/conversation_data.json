    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions, we must consider the dissociation equilibrium of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the reaction:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for this reaction is given as 5.0 x 10¹⁰.\n\nThe problem, however, asks for the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions, which are formed from the *dissociation* of the complex. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d) is the reciprocal of the formation constant (K_f):\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table (ICE table) to solve for the concentration of Ca²⁺. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates from the complex.\n\n| Species | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nThe expression for the dissociation constant, K_d, is:\nK_d = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻]\n\nSubstituting the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant is very small. This implies that the dissociation of the complex will be minimal, and therefore 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\nx² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is therefore approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nB) 1.0x10⁻² M\nC) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 2.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
