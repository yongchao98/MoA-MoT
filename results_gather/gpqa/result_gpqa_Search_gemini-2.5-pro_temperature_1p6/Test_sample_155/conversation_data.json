    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatographic observations.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) is a stereospecific *syn*-addition that forms an epoxide. Starting with (E)-oct-4-ene, a trans alkene, this syn-addition results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring via an *anti*-addition of a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Similarly, the hydrolysis of the (4S,5S)-epoxide results in (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1:** (4R,5S)- and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule, which is a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to a plane of symmetry. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: the meso diol.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to (Z)-oct-4-ene, a cis alkene, forms a meso epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. Because the starting alkene is symmetrical, only this single meso epoxide is formed.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-addition of water to the meso epoxide proceeds as follows:\n    *   Nucleophilic attack by water at one carbon of the protonated epoxide results in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon atom yields the enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2:** This reaction produces a racemic mixture, meaning an equal amount of the two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso compound) from Reaction 1.\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer A) from Reaction 2.\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer B) from Reaction 2.\n\nThe relationship between the meso compound and each of the enantiomers is diastereomeric.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n\n*   Standard HPLC columns use an achiral stationary phase and cannot distinguish between enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties and can be separated on an achiral column.\n*   Consequently, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the racemic mixture of enantiomers and one for the meso compound.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC columns use a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will have different retention times and appear as two distinct peaks.\n*   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two compounds, will also be separated and will have its own unique retention time.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers, resulting in **three peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
