    "The preliminary analysis seems correct. The search results confirm the fundamental physics principles used.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature**: Multiple sources (,,,) confirm that the equilibrium temperature is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated by the planet. The formula involves the star's properties (Luminosity or Temperature and Radius), the planet's orbital distance (a), and the planet's albedo (A).\n\n    The power absorbed is proportional to `(1 - A) * L_star / a^2`.\n    The power radiated is proportional to `T_eq^4`.\n    Balancing these gives `T_eq^4 ∝ (1 - A) / a^2`, which means `T_eq ∝ [(1 - A) / a^2]^(1/4)`.\n    Since the albedo `A` is the same for all three planets, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures becomes:\n    `T_eq_i / T_eq_j = (a_j^2 / a_i^2)^(1/4) = (a_j / a_i)^(1/2)`.\n    This confirms my initial derivation: `T_eq_i / T_eq_j = sqrt(a_j / a_i)`.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law**: The search results (,,,,) unanimously state that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3`.\n    For planets around the same star, this means `P_i^2 / P_j^2 = a_i^3 / a_j^3`, which can be rearranged to `a_i / a_j = (P_i / P_j)^(2/3)`. This also confirms my initial derivation.\n\nThe rest of the calculation is a straightforward application of these principles.\n\n*   From the temperature ratio: `(T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^2 = a_j / a_i`\n*   From Kepler's law: `a_j / a_i = (P_j / P_i)^(2/3)`\n*   Equating them: `(T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^2 = (P_j / P_i)^(2/3)`\n*   Raising both sides to the power of 3/2: `[(T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^2]^(3/2) = P_j / P_i`\n*   `P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^3`\n\nThis confirms my formula.\n\nNow, I will re-do the calculation to be certain.\n*   Given `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`. Therefore, `P2 / P1 = (1.4)^3 = 2.744`.\n*   Given `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`. Therefore, `P3 / P2 = (2.3)^3 = 12.167`.\n*   We need to find `P3 / P1`.\n*   `P3 / P1 = (P3 / P2) * (P2 / P1) = 12.167 * 2.744`.\n*   `12.167 * 2.744 = 33.385568`.\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThe information regarding the TTV discovery method and the mass ratios appears to be extraneous detail not required for the calculation. The albedo value being equal for all planets is a necessary condition to allow the albedo term to cancel out from the temperature ratio equation. The problem specifies circular orbits, so the semi-major axis 'a' is simply the orbital distance.\n\nThe result is robustly derived from the fundamental principles of planetary science.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) ~ 4.4\nB) ~ 33.4\nC) ~ 3.2\nD) ~ 10.4\n\nMy calculated value of ~33.4 matches option B.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to relate the orbital period of a planet to its equilibrium temperature.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the luminosity of its star (L_star), its orbital distance (semi-major axis, *a*), and its albedo (A). For a planet in a circular orbit, the relationship is T_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) * L_star / a². Since all three planets orbit the same star (L_star is constant) and have the same albedo (A=0.3), the equilibrium temperature is related to the orbital distance by T_eq ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/√a.\n\n2.  **Relationship between Temperature Ratios and Orbital Distance:**\n    From the relationship T_eq ∝ 1/√a, we can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (e.g., Planet_i and Planet_j) in the same system as:\n    T_eq_i / T_eq_j = √a_j / √a_i = (a_j / a_i)^(1/2)\n\n3.  **Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    P² ∝ a³ or P ∝ a^(3/2)\n    This means the ratio of their orbital distances is related to the ratio of their orbital periods:\n    a_j / a_i = (P_j / P_i)^(2/3)\n\n4.  **Combining the Relationships:** Now we can substitute the expression for the orbital distance ratio from Kepler's Third Law into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq_i / T_eq_j = [(P_j / P_i)^(2/3)]^(1/2) = (P_j / P_i)^(1/3)\n    Rearranging this to solve for the period ratio gives:\n    P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)³\n\n5.  **Calculations:**\n    We are given the following temperature ratios:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\n    Using the formula we derived, we can find the ratios of the orbital periods:\n    *   P2 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)³ = (1.4)³ = 2.744\n    *   P3 / P2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)³ = (2.3)³ = 12.167\n\n    To find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 (P3 / P1), we multiply the two period ratios we just calculated:\n    P3 / P1 = (P3 / P2) * (P2 / P1)\n    P3 / P1 = 12.167 * 2.744 ≈ 33.385\n\n    This value is approximately 33.4. The information about the masses of the planets and the TTV method of discovery are not needed for this calculation.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~ 4.4\nB) ~ 33.4\nC) ~ 3.2\nD) ~ 10.4\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
