    "To determine the comoving distance to the quasar, we first need to calculate its redshift. The problem describes a peak in the quasar's spectrum at a wavelength of 790 nm, with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This feature is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line. The drop-off at shorter wavelengths is due to the Lyman-alpha forest, which is a series of absorption lines caused by neutral hydrogen clouds in the intergalactic medium between us and the quasar.\n\nThe rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line, which corresponds to the electron transition from n=2 to n=1 in a hydrogen atom, is approximately 121.6 nm (or 1216 Å).\n\nWe can calculate the redshift (z) using the following formula:\n*z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1*\n\nGiven:\n*   Observed wavelength (λ_observed) = 790 nm\n*   Rest wavelength (λ_rest) = 121.6 nm\n\nCalculation:\n*   z = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\n*   z ≈ 6.497 - 1\n*   z ≈ 5.5\n\nNow, with the redshift z ≈ 5.5, we can calculate the comoving distance. This calculation requires the cosmological parameters provided:\n*   Hubble constant (H₀) = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Matter density parameter (Ωₘ) = 0.3\n*   Dark energy density parameter (Ωₗ) = 0.7\n*   A flat universe (implying the curvature density parameter Ωₖ = 0)\n\nThe comoving distance is calculated by integrating over redshift, a task best performed by a cosmological calculator. Using a standard cosmology calculator with these parameters (z = 5.5, H₀ = 70, Ωₘ = 0.3, Ωₗ = 0.7), the comoving radial distance is approximately 8 Gpc.\n\n<<<B>>>"
