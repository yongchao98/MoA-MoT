    "The correct IUPAC name for the described molecule is determined by systematically applying IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n### Structure Determination:\n\n1.  **Parent Structure**: A benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group is a benzoic acid. This group is assigned position 1.\n2.  **Substituent Positions**:\n    *   A methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid, placing it at position 4.\n    *   A hydroxyl group and a dimethylamino group are ortho to the carboxylic acid, at positions 2 and 6.\n    *   A carbaldehyde (formyl) group and a cyano group are meta to the carboxylic acid, at positions 3 and 5. They are also meta to each other.\n    *   A crucial constraint is that the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are both ortho to the cyano group. For the cyano group to be ortho to the methoxy group at C4, it must be at C3 or C5. For it also to be ortho to the hydroxyl group, the hydroxyl group and cyano group must be on adjacent carbons. This leads to the following unique arrangement:\n        *   **C1**: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n        *   **C2**: -OH (Hydroxyl)\n        *   **C3**: -CN (Cyano)\n        *   **C4**: -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n        *   **C5**: -CHO (Formyl/Carbaldehyde)\n        *   **C6**: -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n\n### IUPAC Naming and Numbering:\n\n1.  **Principal Functional Group**: The carboxylic acid group has the highest priority and defines the parent name as **benzoic acid**. Its carbon is C1.\n2.  **Numbering the Ring**: With C1 fixed, the ring can be numbered clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   Counter-clockwise: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n    *   Clockwise: 2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy.\n    Both numbering schemes result in the same set of locants (positions): {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n3.  **Tie-Breaker Rule**: When locant sets are identical, the numbering is chosen to give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n4.  **Alphabetical Order of Substituents**:\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n5.  **Applying the Tie-Breaker**:\n    *   The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\".\n    *   The counter-clockwise numbering assigns locant **3** to the cyano group.\n    *   The clockwise numbering assigns locant **5** to the cyano group.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the counter-clockwise numbering is correct.\n\n### Final Name Assembly:\n\nUsing the correct counter-clockwise numbering, the substituents are:\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nThese prefixes are arranged in alphabetical order before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\nThe final, correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
