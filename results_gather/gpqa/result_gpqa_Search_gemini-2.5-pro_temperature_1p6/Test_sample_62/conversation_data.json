    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to calculate the energy of the transition. The molecule transitions from its fundamental (ground) state to the next state with the lowest possible energy upon absorbing a photon.\n\n### 1. Energy Levels of the Diatomic Molecule\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\n*   **E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * J(J + 1)**\n\nWhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\n\nThe **fundamental or ground state** is the state with the lowest possible energy, which corresponds to `v=0` and `J=0`.\n\n**E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω**\n\nThe \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" requires finding the smallest energy jump from the ground state. According to rovibrational selection rules for a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, for a photon to be absorbed, the change in quantum numbers must be `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n\nSince the molecule starts at `J=0`, a transition with `ΔJ = -1` is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed transition from the ground state is to the state where `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = +1`. This means the final state is `v=1` and `J=1`.\n\n**E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I**\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between the final and initial energy states:\n\n**ΔE = E_final - E_initial**\n**ΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ] - (1/2)ħω**\n**ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I**\n\nTo calculate this, we need the moment of inertia, `I`.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the reduced mass (μ).**\nThe reduced mass `μ` is given by `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`.\n*   Mx = 20 amu\n*   My = 2 amu\n*   1 amu ≈ 1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\nμ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\nμ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the moment of inertia (I).**\nThe moment of inertia `I` is `I = μ * R²`.\n*   R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nI = (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\nI = (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²)\nI = 1.2072 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the two components of the energy change.**\n*   Vibrational term: `ħω` = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   Rotational term: `ħ²/I` = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2072 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n**Step 4: Calculate total ΔE.**\nΔE = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0092 x 10⁻²⁰ J = 4.2252 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 4. Calculating the Photon Momentum (p)\n\nThe momentum of a photon (`p`) is related to its energy (`E`) by the equation `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light (≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s). Therefore, `p = ΔE / c`.\n\np = (4.2252 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)\n**p ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
