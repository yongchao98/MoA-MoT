    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a Very Large Telescope (VLT) Unit Telescope (UT), we must first establish the detection limit and then evaluate each star's visibility and brightness.\n\nA star is considered \"detectable\" if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved in a one-hour exposure. According to technical documentation for ESPRESSO, in its 1-UT mode (using a single 8m VLT), it can achieve an S/N of 10 in one hour for a star with an apparent visual magnitude (V) of about 17.1 to 19. Brighter stars, which have a lower magnitude number, will be detectable.\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This southern latitude dictates which stars are visible in its sky. Generally, stars with a declination south of about +65 degrees are observable from Paranal.\n\nHere is the analysis for each star:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** This is the second-brightest star in the night sky with an apparent visual magnitude of -0.74. Its declination is approximately -52° 41', placing it in the southern celestial hemisphere. Given its extreme brightness (magnitude much less than 17) and its southern declination, Canopus is easily visible and detectable from Paranal.\n\n*   **b) Polaris:** Also known as the North Star, Polaris has an apparent visual magnitude of about +1.98. Its declination is very high in the north, at approximately +89° 15'. Since the observatory is at a latitude of -24.6°, Polaris is permanently below the horizon and therefore not visible or detectable from Paranal.\n\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:** To find the apparent magnitude (m) from the absolute magnitude (M=15) and distance (d=10 pc), we use the formula: m = M - 5 + 5*log10(d).\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5*log10(10) = 15 - 5 + 5(1) = **15 mag**.\n    This star has a declination of 0°, which is on the celestial equator and is visible from Paranal. With an apparent magnitude of 15, it is brighter than the detection limit of V≈17.1. Thus, it is detectable.\n\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:** Using the same formula with d=200 pc:\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5*log10(200) ≈ 10 + 5(2.30) = 10 + 11.5 = **21.5 mag**.\n    This star is too faint (magnitude greater than 17.1) to be detected under the specified conditions.\n\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:** Using the same formula with d=5 pc:\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5*log10(5) ≈ 10 + 5(0.70) = 10 + 3.5 = **13.5 mag**.\n    This star has a declination of 0°, making it visible. Its apparent magnitude of 13.5 is well within the detection limit. Thus, it is detectable.\n\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:** Using the same formula with d=50 pc:\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5*log10(50) ≈ 10 + 5(1.70) = 10 + 8.5 = **18.5 mag**.\n    This star has a declination of 0° and is visible. However, with an apparent magnitude of 18.5, it is fainter than the detection limit of V≈17.1 and would not be detectable under the given criteria.\n\nIn summary, the detectable stars are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star (c) at 10 pc\n3.  Star (e) at 5 pc\n\nA total of three stars from the list are detectable.\n\n<<<C>>>"
