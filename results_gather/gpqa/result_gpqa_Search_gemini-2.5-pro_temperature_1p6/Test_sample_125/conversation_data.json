    "Here is a breakdown of the chemical reactions and the subsequent analysis.\n\n### Reaction I\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone that has a single chiral center at the C5 position. It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at the C3 position to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Because the starting material is chiral, the attack of the hydride on the prochiral carbonyl group results in the formation of two diastereomers: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** A mixture of two diastereomers.\n\n### Reaction II\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, a symmetrical molecule with no stereocenters. It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4. This reduction yields three stereoisomeric products:\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nThe (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are a pair of enantiomers. The meso form is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry and is a diastereomer of the other two products.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** A mixture of three stereoisomers (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### Combined Mixture Analysis\nWhen the products from both reactions are combined, there is a total of five distinct chemical compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Analysis using Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by this technique. Enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated; they will elute together as a single peak.\n\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will have different polarities and will therefore produce **two separate peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as **one peak**. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity, resulting in a **second peak**.\n*   Since the products of Reaction I (C7 alcohols with an ether group) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally very different, it is expected that all these groups will elute at different times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC will be the sum of the distinguishable components: 2 peaks from Reaction I + 2 peaks from Reaction II = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis using Chiral HPLC:**\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers. As a result, it can separate not only diastereomers but also pairs of enantiomers.\n\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n*   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated from each other. The chiral column will resolve the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers into **two peaks**, and the meso compound, being a diastereomer to the others, will produce its own **third peak**.\n*   Again, the products from Reaction I and Reaction II are different molecules and will be separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC will be the sum of all individual stereoisomers: 2 peaks from Reaction I + 3 peaks from Reaction II = **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the combined mixture will show 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>"
