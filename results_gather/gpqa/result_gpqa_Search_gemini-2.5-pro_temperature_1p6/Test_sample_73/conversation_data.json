    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Principle of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is constant and does not depend on how long the atom has already existed. The decay follows an exponential law.\n\n### 2. Define the Decay Probability\n\nThe probability that an atom has *not* decayed by a certain time *t* (the survival probability) is given by the formula:\n*P(survival > t) = e⁻ˡᵗ*\n\nWhere:\n*   **e** is the base of the natural logarithm.\n*   **λ (lambda)** is the decay constant, which is unique for each radioactive element.\n*   **t** is the time elapsed.\n\nConsequently, the probability that an atom *will* decay within time *t* is:\n*P(decay ≤ t) = 1 - e⁻ˡᵗ*\n\n### 3. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nWe are given that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32%. We can use this information to find the decay constant λ.\n\n*   P(decay ≤ 100) = 0.32\n*   1 - e⁻ˡ⁽¹⁰⁰⁾ = 0.32\n*   e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ = 1 - 0.32\n*   e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ = 0.68\n\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n*   -100λ = ln(0.68)\n*   λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability for the Next Time Interval\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\nBecause the decay process is memoryless, the fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability. Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is simply the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n\nWe calculate P(decay ≤ 150):\n\n*   P(decay ≤ 150) = 1 - e⁻ˡ⁽¹⁵⁰⁾\n\nNow, substitute the expression for λ we found earlier:\n\n*   P(decay ≤ 150) = 1 - e⁻⁽⁻ˡⁿ⁽⁰·⁶⁸⁾ ¹⁰⁰⁾ ˣ ¹⁵⁰\n*   P(decay ≤ 150) = 1 - e⁽¹⁵⁰/¹⁰⁰⁾ ˣ ˡⁿ⁽⁰·⁶⁸⁾\n*   P(decay ≤ 150) = 1 - e¹·⁵ ˣ ˡⁿ⁽⁰·⁶⁸⁾\n\nUsing the logarithm property that *a* ln(*b*) = ln(*b*ᵃ):\n\n*   P(decay ≤ 150) = 1 - eˡⁿ⁽⁰·⁶⁸¹·⁵⁾\n\nSince eˡⁿ⁽ˣ⁾ = x:\n\n*   P(decay ≤ 150) = 1 - 0.68¹·⁵\n\nNow, we calculate the final value:\n\n*   0.68¹·⁵ ≈ 0.5607\n*   P(decay ≤ 150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607\n*   P(decay ≤ 150) ≈ 0.4393\n\nThis probability, 0.4393, is equivalent to 43.93%.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probability of approximately 44% matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
