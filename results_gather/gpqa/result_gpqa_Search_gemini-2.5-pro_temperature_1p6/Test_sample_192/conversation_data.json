    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the relationship:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Relationship:** The problem states that the number of stars observed, N, varies with parallax (plx) as `N ~ 1/plx⁵` or `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`. In stellar astronomy, this typically refers to the cumulative number of stars with a parallax *greater than* a certain value `plx`. A larger parallax means a closer star. Therefore, this relationship describes the total count of stars up to a certain distance.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (r) of a star. The relationship is `plx = 1/r`. This means a small parallax corresponds to a large distance, and vice-versa.\n\n3.  **Express Star Count in Terms of Distance:** Substitute the parallax-distance relationship into the given formula for the number of stars:\n    *   We have `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    *   Substituting `plx = 1/r`, we get `N ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`.\n    *   This simplifies to `N ∝ r⁵`.\n    *   This equation tells us that the total number of stars (N) within a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Determine the Change in Star Count with Distance:** The question asks how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This is asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative of N with respect to r, or `dN/dr`.\n\n5.  **Differentiate the Expression:** To find `dN/dr`, we differentiate the proportionality `N ∝ r⁵`. Let's introduce a constant of proportionality, C, so that `N = C * r⁵`.\n    *   `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r⁵)`\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n    *   `dN/dr = 5 * C * r⁴`\n\n6.  **Final Proportionality:** The result `dN/dr = 5Cr⁴` shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is directly proportional to `r⁴`.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance as `r⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
