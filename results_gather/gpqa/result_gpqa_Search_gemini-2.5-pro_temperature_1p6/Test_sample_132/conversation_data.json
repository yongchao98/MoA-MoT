    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻).\n\n1.  **Confirm Molar Masses and Ka Values**: The provided molar masses for KH₂PO₄ (136.09 g/mol) and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol) are correct. The dissociation constants (Ka) for phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) can vary slightly depending on the source, but the provided values are standard for such problems. The three dissociation steps for phosphoric acid are sequential.\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of Each Component**:\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles. KH₂PO₄ dissociates to form the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻).\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles. Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates to form the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻).\n\n3.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations**: The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   Initial concentration of [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 moles / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 moles / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**: The solution is a buffer composed of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid. We can use the Ka₂ expression to find the hydrogen ion concentration.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻] = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n    *   Rearranging for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ( [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻] )\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion [PO₄³⁻] Concentration**: The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid. We can use the Ka₃ expression for this calculation.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻] = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n    *   Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]: [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ( [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺] )\n    *   We use the initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻ and the calculated [H⁺].\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
