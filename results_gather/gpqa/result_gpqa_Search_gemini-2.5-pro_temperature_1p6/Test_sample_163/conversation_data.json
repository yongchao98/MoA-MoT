    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M1 / M2). The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system that also exhibits eclipses can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2) of the two stars.\n\nThe formula for the total mass (M = m1 + m2) is derived from Kepler's Third Law and is given by:\n\nM = [ P / (2πG * sin³(i)) ] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nwhere:\n*   P is the orbital period\n*   G is the gravitational constant\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit to the plane of the sky\n*   K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars\n\nSince both systems are described as exhibiting eclipses, it is a standard and reasonable assumption that their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle, i, is approximately 90°, and therefore sin(i) is approximately 1.\n\nWith this assumption, the formula simplifies to:\n\nM ≈ [ P / (2πG) ] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2):\n\nM1 / M2 = { [ P1 / (2πG) ] * (K1a + K1b)³ } / { [ P2 / (2πG) ] * (K2a + K2b)³ }\n\nThe constant term (2πG) cancels out, leaving:\n\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]³\n\nNext, we plug in the values provided for each system. It's important to use consistent units for periods and velocities, but since we are taking ratios, the conversion factors will cancel out.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star a (K1a) = 10 km/s\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star b (K1b) = 5 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star a (K2a) = 15 km/s\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star b (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\nNow, let's calculate the components of the ratio:\n*   The ratio of the periods: P1 / P2 = 2 years / 1 year = 2\n*   The sum of the radial velocity amplitudes for system 1: K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   The sum of the radial velocity amplitudes for system 2: K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   The ratio of the summed amplitudes: (15 km/s) / (25 km/s) = 3 / 5 = 0.6\n\nFinally, we substitute these values back into the mass ratio formula:\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated mass ratio is approximately 0.432, which is closest to the value of 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
