    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The resulting anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The single ¹H peak at 7 ppm indicates two chemically equivalent vinyl protons.\n        *   The two ¹³C peaks correspond to the vinyl carbons (C=C, ~137 ppm) and the anhydride carbonyl carbons (C=O, ~165 ppm).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**, which is formed by the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid).\n    *   **Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons and a CH₂ group at the 5-position.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n\n3.  **Identify the Products and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction produces two diastereomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   The **Alder Endo Rule** states that the major product is typically the *endo* adduct, which is formed faster (the kinetic product) due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* product is usually more stable (the thermodynamic product) but forms more slowly. In the absence of conditions favoring thermodynamic control (like high heat), the major product is the *endo* adduct.\n    *   **Major product = Endo adduct**\n    *   **Minor product = Exo adduct**\n\n4.  **Analyze the Product Structure and Predict NOESY Correlations:**\n    *   Let's analyze the proton environment in the bicyclic product. Following standard nomenclature for bicyclo[2.2.1]heptenes:\n        *   **Ha (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm):** These are the two equivalent protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride (C5 and C6). They are adjacent to the carbonyl groups.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyls (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3).\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls (6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4).\n        *   **Bridge Protons (~1.5 ppm):** These are the two protons on the C7 bridge (the CH₂ group from the original diene). They are typically non-equivalent and would likely show up as two signals, potentially doublets due to coupling with each other.\n\n    *   Now, let's consider the spatial relationships (which is what NOESY measures) in the two isomers:\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the main ring, in a *cis* or *syn* orientation relative to the C7 bridge. In this conformation, the Ha protons (at C5 and C6) are on the *endo* face. They point down into the \"basket\" of the bicyclic system, placing them very close to the *syn* proton of the C7 bridge. They are far away from the vinylic methyl groups.\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"up,\" away from the C7 bridge and towards the C2=C3 double bond. Here, the Ha protons are on the *exo* face. They are far from the C7 bridge protons but are now in close proximity to the vinylic methyl groups.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Question and Options:**\n    *   The question states that a cross-peak is **present in the major product** and absent in the minor product.\n    *   Based on our analysis, the key distinguishing NOE cross-peak for the **major (*endo*) product** is between the anhydride protons (**Ha**) and the C7 bridge protons.\n    *   The key distinguishing NOE cross-peak for the **minor (*exo*) product** would be between the anhydride protons (**Ha**) and the vinylic methyls.\n    *   Let's look at the options again with our chemical shift assignments:\n        *   A) 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (**vinylic methyls**) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**Ha**). This corresponds to the *exo* (minor) product.\n        *   B) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (**bridgehead methyls**) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (**C7-H**). Unlikely to be the main distinguishing NOE.\n        *   C) 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (**C7-H**) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**Ha**). This corresponds to the *endo* (major) product. This matches our prediction.\n        *   D) A cross-peak between the two different 6H methyl singlets. This is unlikely to be the key distinguishing feature between the isomers.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The major product is the *endo* adduct. In this isomer, the protons from the anhydride part of the molecule (Ha, the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the protons on the C7 bridge (a 1H signal around ~1.5 ppm). This proximity gives rise to a strong NOESY cross-peak that would be absent in the *exo* (minor) isomer. Therefore, the cross-peak connects the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>"
