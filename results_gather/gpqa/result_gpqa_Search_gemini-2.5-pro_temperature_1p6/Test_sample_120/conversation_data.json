    "The reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis. The key principles governing this reaction are its regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reactants:**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic compound where an epoxide ring is fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6. C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and a methyl group), while C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, O, and hydrogen).\n*   **Reagent:** Me2CuLi, a Gilman reagent, serves as a source of the soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity:**\nOrganocuprates are known to attack epoxides at the less sterically hindered carbon atom. In the given epoxide, C1 is tertiary and has a methyl substituent, making it more sterically hindered than the secondary C6. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the C6 carbon.\n\n**3. Stereoselectivity:**\nThe ring-opening of epoxides by organocuprates proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism. This mechanism involves a backside attack by the nucleophile on the carbon atom, leading to an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the site of attack. The initial stereochemistry at the attacked carbon, C6, is (S). Due to the Sₙ2 attack, its configuration will invert to (R). The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n\n**4. Product Formation and IUPAC Naming:**\n*   **Attack and Ring Opening:** The nucleophilic attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. Subsequent protonation during aqueous workup converts the oxygen attached to C1 into a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Resulting Structure:** The product is a cyclohexanol ring with four methyl groups. The original methyl groups are at C1, C3, and C4, and a new methyl group has been added to C6.\n*   **IUPAC Nomenclature:** To name the final product, the cyclohexane ring is numbered starting from the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group, which is the new C1 (the original C1). To assign the lowest possible locants to the substituents, the ring is numbered such that the original C6 becomes the new C2. This gives the substituent positions as 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl. Thus, the base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Determining Product Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The configuration at the new C1 (original C1) remains **R**.\n    *   The configuration at the new C2 (original C6) inverts from (S) to **R**.\n    *   The configuration at the new C4 (original C4) remains **R**.\n    *   The configuration at the new C5 (original C3) remains **R**.\n\nCombining these pieces, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
