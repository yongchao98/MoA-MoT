    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the permitted and non-permitted partial waves based on fundamental conservation laws and principles of nuclear physics.\n\n### **1. Initial State Analysis**\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's break down its quantum numbers:\n*   **Term Symbol:** `(2S+1)L(J)` is `1S0`.\n*   **Total Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S(NN)_initial = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L(NN)_initial = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The subscript is 0, so `J(NN)_initial = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of a state is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### **2. Conservation Laws and Selection Rules**\n\nFor the decay `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X` to be permitted, it must satisfy several rules:\n\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle for the final NN state:** The problem states that the final NN state has an isospin `T(NN)_final = 0` and must satisfy the relation `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This simplifies to `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   **Rule 1:** Therefore, the sum of the final spin and final orbital angular momentum of the NN system (`S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final`) must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   `J_initial = J_final`.\n    *   The initial state `1S0` has `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J(NN)_final`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`L(X)`). We assume particle X is spinless, so its total angular momentum is just `L(X)`.\n    *   `vec(J(NN)_final) + vec(L(X)) = 0`.\n    *   **Rule 2:** This implies that the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN)_final = L(X)`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   `P_final` is the product of the parity of the final NN state `P(NN)_final` and the total parity of particle X `P(X)_total`.\n    *   `P(NN)_final = (-1)^L(NN)_final`.\n    *   `P(X)_total = P(X)_intrinsic * (-1)^L(X)`. We are given `P(X)_intrinsic = -1`.\n    *   The equation becomes: `+1 = (-1)^L(NN)_final * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`.\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L(NN)_final + L(X)) = -1`.\n    *   **Rule 3:** This means the sum (`L(NN)_final + L(X)`) must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Physicality of States:** The states described must be physically possible for a two-nucleon system. Since nucleons are spin-1/2 fermions, the total spin (S) of a two-nucleon system can only be S=0 (singlet) or S=1 (triplet). This means the multiplicity `2S+1` can only be 1 or 3.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe now apply these four rules to each proposed transition.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   **Final NN state (`3P0`):** S=1, L=1, J=0.\n*   **Particle X (`s`):** L(X)=0.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli/Isospin):** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (Even). This violates the requirement that `S+L` must be odd for a T=0 state.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   **Final NN state (`3D3`):** S=1, L=2, J=3.\n*   **Particle X (`f`):** L(X)=3.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli/Isospin):** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (Odd). -> OK.\n*   **Rule 2 (Ang. Momentum):** `J(NN)=3`, `L(X)=3`. -> OK.\n*   **Rule 3 (Parity):** `L(NN)+L(X) = 2+3 = 5` (Odd). -> OK.\n*   **Physicality:** `S=1` is a valid spin for an NN system. -> OK.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   **Final NN state (`7D1`):** `2S+1 = 7` implies `S=3`.\n*   **Physicality:** A two-nucleon system cannot have a total spin of S=3. The maximum possible spin is `1/2 + 1/2 = 1`. Therefore, the final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is impossible to form with two nucleons.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   **Final NN state (`3S1`):** S=1, L=0, J=1.\n*   **Particle X (`p`):** L(X)=1.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli/Isospin):** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (Odd). -> OK.\n*   **Rule 2 (Ang. Momentum):** `J(NN)=1`, `L(X)=1`. -> OK.\n*   **Rule 3 (Parity):** `L(NN)+L(X) = 0+1 = 1` (Odd). -> OK.\n*   **Physicality:** `S=1` is a valid spin for an NN system. -> OK.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBoth options A and C represent non-permitted transitions, but for different reasons:\n*   **Option A** is forbidden by the Pauli-derived selection rule stipulated in the problem (`T=0` requires `S+L` to be odd).\n*   **Option C** is forbidden for a more fundamental reason: the final state (`7D1`) is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons.\n\nIn physics problems of this nature, an impossible final state represents an absolute prohibition. If the final state cannot exist, no transition to it is possible, rendering the checks of other conservation laws moot.\n\nTherefore, the most definitively \"not permitted\" partial wave is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
