    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of the acidic and basic species and then determine which is in excess after neutralization.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each component:**\n    *   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 moles\n    *   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 moles\n        Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 moles\n        Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely to yield two OH⁻ ions per formula unit: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻.\n        Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles.\n\n2.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n    First, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2).\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (strong acid) = 0.080 moles\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ (strong base) = 0.180 moles\n    The H⁺ ions will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 moles - 0.080 moles = 0.100 moles.\n\n    Next, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ (remaining) = 0.100 moles\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 moles\n    The CH3COOH will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in final excess = 0.100 moles - 0.050 moles = 0.050 moles.\n\n3.  **Calculate the final pH:**\n    The final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻, a strong base. The pH is determined by the concentration of this excess strong base.\n    *   **Total volume of the solution:** 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n    *   **Concentration of excess OH⁻:**\n        [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n        [OH⁻] = 0.050 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n    *   **Calculate pOH:**\n        pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n        pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   **Calculate pH:**\n        pH = 14 - pOH\n        pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
