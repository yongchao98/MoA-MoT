    "Here is a step-by-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the wobble of their host star. This wobble is caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. As the star moves towards and away from us, its light experiences a Doppler shift. This is seen as a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (vᵣ). The maximum radial velocity, known as the semi-amplitude (K), corresponds to the maximum observed wavelength shift.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars (K₁ and K₂) is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts (Δλ₁ and Δλ₂).\n\n*   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n*   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n*   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n**2. Relate Radial Velocity (K) to Orbital Properties**\n\nFor a star with a planet in a circular orbit, the velocity semi-amplitude (K) can be described by the following relationship when the planet's mass (mₚ) is much smaller than the star's mass (Mₛ).\n\n*   K ∝ (mₚ / Mₛ) * (1 / a)¹ᐟ²\n\nHere, 'a' is the semi-major axis, or the radius of the circular orbit.\n\n**3. Incorporate Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) of a planet is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a).\n\n*   P² ∝ a³\n\nThis can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n\n*   a ∝ P²ᐟ³\n\n**4. Combine the Equations to Find the Relationship Between K and P**\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for 'a' from Kepler's Third Law into the equation for the velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\n*   K ∝ (mₚ / Mₛ) * (1 / (P²ᐟ³)¹ᐟ²)\n*   K ∝ (mₚ / Mₛ) * (1 / P¹ᐟ³)\n*   K ∝ (mₚ / Mₛ) * P⁻¹ᐟ³\n\n**5. Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n\nThe problem states that the stars have identical masses (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂) and the planets have similar masses (mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂). Because of this, these terms will cancel out when we take the ratio of the velocities.\n\n*   K₂ / K₁ = (P₂ / P₁)⁻¹ᐟ³\n*   K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)¹ᐟ³\n\nWe already calculated that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4.\n\n*   1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)¹ᐟ³\n\nNow, we can solve for the required ratio, P₂ / P₁. First, cube both sides to solve for P₁ / P₂:\n\n*   P₁ / P₂ = 1.4³ = 2.744\n\nFinally, take the reciprocal to find P₂ / P₁:\n\n*   P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>"
