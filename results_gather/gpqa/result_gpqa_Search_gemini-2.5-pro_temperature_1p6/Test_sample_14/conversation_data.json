    "The search results confirm the formulas used.\n\n-   The transit probability (p) for a planet in a circular orbit is approximately p ≈ R_s / a, where R_s is the stellar radius and 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n-   Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P), semi-major axis (a), and stellar mass (M_s). The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, and inversely proportional to the mass of the star. This can be written as P² ∝ a³ / M_s.\n-   Rearranging Kepler's law to solve for 'a' gives a ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3).\n\nMy derivation of the probability ratio was:\np1 / p2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)\n\nThe given information is:\n-   R_s1 / R_s2 = 1 (same radii)\n-   M_s1 = 2 * M_s2  => M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2\n-   P1 = P2 / 3  => P2 / P1 = 3\n\nPlugging these values into the ratio equation:\np1 / p2 = (1) * (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)\np1 / p2 = ( (3^2) / 2 )^(1/3)\np1 / p2 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\np1 / p2 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nNow, I will calculate the cube root of 4.5.\n(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096\n\nSo, the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. This matches option B. The logic and calculations are sound and confirmed by the search results.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  Identify the formula for transit probability: p ≈ R_s / a. Confirmed.\n2.  Identify the relationship between a, P, and M_s from Kepler's Third Law: a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3). Confirmed.\n3.  Substitute the expression for 'a' into the probability formula: p ∝ R_s / (M_s * P²)^(1/3). Correct.\n4.  Form the ratio p1 / p2: p1 / p2 = (R_s1/R_s2) * (M_s2/M_s1)^(1/3) * (P2/P1)^(2/3). Correct.\n5.  Substitute the given values: R_s1/R_s2 = 1, M_s2/M_s1 = 1/2, P2/P1 = 3. Correct.\n6.  Calculate the final ratio: (1) * (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3) = (9/2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3) ≈ 1.65. Correct.\n\nThe result consistently points to Planet_1 being preferred by a factor of ~1.65. Therefore, option B is the correct choice.\nTo answer this question, we need to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2.\n\nThe probability (p) that a planet will transit its host star, assuming a circular orbit, is given by the ratio of the star's radius (R_s) to the planet's semi-major axis (a):\n\np = R_s / a\n\nTo find the semi-major axis (a), we can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which relates the orbital period (P), the semi-major axis, and the mass of the host star (M_s):\n\nP² ∝ a³ / M_s\n\nBy rearranging this formula to solve for the semi-major axis (a), we get:\n\na³ ∝ P² * M_s\na ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for 'a' back into the transit probability formula:\n\np ∝ R_s / (P² * M_s)^(1/3)\n\nTo find out which planet is more likely to be observed transiting, we can calculate the ratio of their probabilities, p₁ / p₂.\n\np₁ / p₂ = [R_s₁ / (P₁² * M_s₁)^(1/3)] / [R_s₂ / (P₂² * M_s₂)^(1/3)]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\np₁ / p₂ = (R_s₁ / R_s₂) * (P₂ / P₁)^(2/3) * (M_s₂ / M_s₁)^(1/3)\n\nLet's use the information provided in the problem:\n*   Both host stars have the same radii: R_s₁ = R_s₂ , so R_s₁ / R_s₂ = 1.\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: P₂ = 3 * P₁ , so P₂ / P₁ = 3.\n*   The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass twice that of the host star of Planet_2: M_s₁ = 2 * M_s₂, so M_s₂ / M_s₁ = 1/2.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the ratio equation:\n\np₁ / p₂ = (1) * (3)^(2/3) * (1/2)^(1/3)\np₁ / p₂ = (3²)^(1/3) * (1/2)^(1/3)\np₁ / p₂ = (9)^(1/3) * (0.5)^(1/3)\np₁ / p₂ = (9 * 0.5)^(1/3)\np₁ / p₂ = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5 gives:\n\np₁ / p₂ ≈ 1.65\n\nThis means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
