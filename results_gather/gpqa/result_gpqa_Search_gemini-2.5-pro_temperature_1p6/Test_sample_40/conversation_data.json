    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, which describes how to combine velocities in a way that is consistent with Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference**:\n    *   The laboratory frame (let's call it S), where the observer is at rest.\n    *   The rest frame of the glass (let's call it S'), which is moving with velocity `v` relative to the lab frame S.\n\n2.  **Determine the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass (S')**:\n    *   The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`).\n    *   The formula is `n = c / u'`.\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the speed of light within the glass, as measured by an observer moving along with the glass, is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula**:\n    *   The formula for adding collinear velocities in special relativity is:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    *   Where:\n        *   `u` is the speed of the object (the light beam) as seen by the observer in the laboratory frame S. This is what we need to find.\n        *   `u'` is the speed of the object in frame S' (the rest frame of the glass), which is `1/n`.\n        *   `v` is the speed of the frame S' (the glass) relative to frame S (the lab).\n        *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is `1`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula**:\n    *   `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n    *   `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression**:\n    *   To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n        `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    *   `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option C. This effect, where the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple sum of the medium's speed and the speed of light within it, was famously observed in the Fizeau experiment in 1851 and later explained by Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
