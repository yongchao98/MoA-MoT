    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. For a hydrocarbon, the mass percentage of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass % H = (number of H atoms * 1.008) / (Molar Mass)`.\n    If we test the general formula for a cycloalkane, C_n_H_2n_, the molar mass is approximately 14_n_ g/mol. The mass of hydrogen is 2_n_ g/mol.\n    Mass % H = (2_n_) / (14_n_) = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428, or 14.28%. This is a perfect match. So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n    The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z, implying all components in X and Y have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is formed from the disproportionation of mixture X. It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids and does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic. We already know one component of Y is substance Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    A disproportionation reaction in this context involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms. One molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    Heating an unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon like cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene with a platinum catalyst can cause it to disproportionate into a fully saturated molecule (cyclohexane) and a fully unsaturated, aromatic molecule (benzene).\n    Therefore, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene does not react with bromine water under these conditions, fitting the description.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X:** Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated. These components react via hydrogen transfer to form mixture Y.\n    Reaction: **Liquid A + Liquid B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)**\n    By conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms on both sides of the reaction must be equal. The products have a total of 12 carbon atoms (6 from cyclohexane, 6 from benzene) and 18 hydrogen atoms (12 from cyclohexane, 6 from benzene).\n    Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must together contain 12 carbons and 18 hydrogens. Since all molecules are established to have a C6 skeleton, the two liquids in X must be C₆Hₓ and C₆Hᵧ, where x + y = 18.\n    The problem specifies that the compounds in mixture X do not have conjugated multiple bonds. Let's examine the possibilities for these C6 unsaturated rings:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀):** Has one double bond, not conjugated. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   **1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈):** Has two double bonds in a conjugated system. This is ruled out by the problem statement.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈):** Has two double bonds that are not conjugated. This is a valid candidate.\n\n4.  **Determine the Composition of Mixture X:** The two liquids in mixture X must be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). Let's check if their hydrogen counts sum to 18:\n    10 (from C₆H₁₀) + 8 (from C₆H₈) = 18. This is correct.\n    The disproportionation reaction is:\n    C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, Heat)--> C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene)\n    In this reaction, cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene. This is a chemically sound reaction.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms:** The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18\n\n<<<D>>>"
