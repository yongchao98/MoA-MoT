    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the major isomer of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene + Maleic Anhydride → Product 1**\n\nThis is a Diels-Alder reaction. Cyclooctatetraene (COT), which exists in a non-planar tub conformation, reacts as the diene with maleic anhydride, an electron-deficient dienophile. For the reaction to occur, a portion of the COT molecule must adopt the necessary *s-cis* conformation. Due to the shape of the cyclooctatetraene molecule, the dienophile adds to the outer, more accessible face to avoid steric hindrance. This results in the formation of the **exo-adduct** as the major product. The product is *exo*-tricyclo[4.2.2.0<sup>2,5</sup>]deca-7,9-diene-3,4-dicarboxylic anhydride, commonly known as the Reppe anhydride.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + Methanol + H₂SO₄ → Product 2**\n\nProduct 1, a cyclic anhydride, is heated with methanol in the presence of a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is an acid-catalyzed esterification reaction. The methanol opens the anhydride ring to form two methyl ester (-COOCH₃) groups. This reaction does not change the stereochemistry of the carbocyclic skeleton. Therefore, the two ester groups in Product 2 will retain the **exo** configuration established in the first step.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + Cyclopentadiene → Product 3**\n\nThis is another Diels-Alder reaction. Product 2, which contains a cyclohexadiene moiety, acts as the dienophile, and cyclopentadiene serves as the diene. Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclopentadiene are well-known to favor the formation of the **endo-adduct** as the major kinetic product. This preference is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. In the *endo* approach, the main body of the dienophile (the tricyclic part of Product 2) is positioned under the diene (cyclopentadiene).\n\n**Determining the Final Structure (Product 3)**\n\nThe final product results from an initial *exo* addition followed by a subsequent *endo* addition.\n\n1.  The two methyl ester groups are in an *exo* orientation on the first bridge formed.\n2.  The new bridge formed from cyclopentadiene (a \"methano\" bridge) is added in an *endo* fashion. This places the methano bridge *syn* (on the same side) relative to the original bridge carrying the ester groups.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the stereochemical descriptors in the provided options, the structure that corresponds to this specific sequence of stereoselective reactions is C.\n\n*   **name**: dimethyl (1R,4S,4aR,4bR,5R,8S,8aS,8bS,10S,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate\n*   **SMILES**: O=C(OC)[C@@H]1[C@H](C=C2)[C@@H]3[C@@H]([C@H]4[C@@H]3[C@@H]5C=C[C@H]4C5)[C@H]2[C@@H]1C(OC)=O\n\n<<<C>>>"
