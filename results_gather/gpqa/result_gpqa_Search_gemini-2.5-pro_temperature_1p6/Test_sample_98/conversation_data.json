    "Here is a step-by-step identification of the unknown compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration.\n\nTogether, these two peaks strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four possible compounds (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described. We need to find the molecule that has protons in the specific electronic environments that would lead to these signals. The n+1 rule states that a signal is split into n+1 peaks by n adjacent, equivalent protons. For more complex molecules, a proton can be coupled to multiple, non-equivalent groups of protons, leading to patterns like doublets of triplets.\n\n*   **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** arises when a single proton is coupled to:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving a doublet, d).\n    *   A group of two equivalent adjacent protons (like a -CH₂- group, giving a triplet, t).\n    *   A group of three equivalent adjacent protons (like a -CH₃ group, giving a quartet, q).\n*   **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** arises when a single proton is coupled to:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving a doublet, d).\n    *   A group of two equivalent adjacent protons (giving a triplet, t).\n    *   Another, different group of two equivalent adjacent protons (giving another triplet, t).\n\nNow let's analyze the structure of each option to see which one matches these patterns.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid):** In this molecule, the proton on carbon 4 is adjacent to the proton on carbon 3 (1H), the -CH₂- group of the main chain (2H), and the -CH₂- group of its ethyl substituent (2H). This environment would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. However, there is no single proton in this molecule that is adjacent to a -CH-, a -CH₂-, and a -CH₃ group simultaneously, so it cannot produce a dtq signal.\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid):** The proton on carbon 4 is adjacent to the proton on carbon 3 (1H), the -CH₂- group at carbon 5 (2H), and the methyl group on carbon 4 (3H). This environment matches the requirements for a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. However, this structure does not have a proton that is coupled to one proton and two separate sets of two protons, so it cannot produce a dtt signal.\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** The proton at carbon 3 is adjacent to the -CH₂- group at carbon 2 (2H), the proton at carbon 4 (1H), and the methyl group on carbon 3 (3H). This would give a triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq). This molecule lacks the environment to produce a dtt signal.\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):** While the condensed formula is written unusually, it corresponds to the IUPAC name 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid (C₉H₁₈O₂). Let's analyze its key protons:\n    *   The proton at carbon 4 (-**H**C(CH₃)-) is coupled to the proton at carbon 3 (1H, giving a doublet), the protons of the -CH₂- group at carbon 5 (2H, giving a triplet), and the protons of the methyl group on its own carbon (3H, giving a quartet). This proton signal will be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   The proton at carbon 3 (-**H**C(C₂H₅)-) is coupled to the proton at carbon 4 (1H, giving a doublet), the protons of the -CH₂- group at carbon 2 (2H, giving a triplet), and the protons of the -CH₂- part of its ethyl substituent (2H, giving another triplet). This proton signal will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCompound **C**, correctly identified as 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is the only structure among the options that contains protons in both of the specific environments required to produce a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
