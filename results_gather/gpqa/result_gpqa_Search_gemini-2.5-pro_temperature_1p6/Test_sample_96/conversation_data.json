    "The primary reason for the less severe phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY) compared to Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) is the process of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). In mammals, to ensure a balanced dosage of X-linked genes between XX females and XY males, one of the two X chromosomes in female cells is randomly inactivated during early embryonic development.\n\nThis same dosage compensation mechanism occurs in individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome. Soon after fertilization (post-zygotically), one of the two X chromosomes is silenced in each cell. This inactivation is a profound epigenetic event involving a long non-coding RNA called Xist, which coats the chromosome to be inactivated and triggers a cascade of modifications. These modifications include the methylation of DNA and the addition of repressive marks to histone proteins, which are catalyzed by enzymes such as histone methyltransferases. This results in the formation of a highly condensed, transcriptionally silent structure known as a Barr body.\n\nBy silencing most of the genes on the extra X chromosome, the cell effectively neutralizes the gene dosage imbalance. While not all genes are silenced—about 15% escape inactivation, contributing to the symptoms of the syndrome—this large-scale silencing dramatically lessens the impact compared to having a fully active third copy of an autosome, such as chromosome 21 in Down's syndrome, for which no such inactivation mechanism exists.\n\nTherefore, the molecular mechanism responsible is the epigenetic modification of chromatin post-fertilization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
