    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed of the two astronauts, we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, as they are traveling at speeds close to the speed of light. The formula for objects moving in the same direction is:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   `v1` is the velocity of the first astronaut = 0.6c\n*   `v2` is the velocity of the second astronaut = 0.5c\n*   `c` is the speed of light\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n*   v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\n*   v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\n*   v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\n*   v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n*   v_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a system of particles is the sum of the individual total energies of each particle. The total relativistic energy of a single particle is given by the equation:\n\nE = γmc²\n\nWhere:\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   `m` is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the particle.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   Mass (m1) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v1) = 0.6c\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\n    *   γ1 = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)² / c²)\n    *   γ1 = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\n    *   γ1 = 1 / √0.64\n    *   γ1 = 1 / 0.8\n    *   γ1 = 1.25\n*   Now, calculate the energy (E1):\n    *   E1 = γ1 * m1 * c²\n    *   E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c²\n    *   E1 = 2.5 mc²\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   Mass (m2) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v2) = 0.5c\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\n    *   γ2 = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)² / c²)\n    *   γ2 = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\n    *   γ2 = 1 / √0.75\n    *   γ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866\n    *   γ2 ≈ 1.1547\n*   Now, calculate the energy (E2):\n    *   E2 = γ2 * m2 * c²\n    *   E2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c²\n    *   E2 ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n*   E_total = E1 + E2\n*   E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\n*   E_total = 5.9641 mc²\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the calculations:\n*   The relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n*   The total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
