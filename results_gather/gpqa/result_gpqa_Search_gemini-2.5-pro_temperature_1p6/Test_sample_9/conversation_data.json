    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n*   **Planet a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    This planet is essentially a replica of Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **Planet b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\n    The density is explicitly given as about 5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to Earth's density.\n\n*   **Planet c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    For planets with the same composition, the density increases with mass. This is because the greater gravitational force of a more massive planet compresses its material more tightly. Since this planet is five times more massive than Earth, its internal pressure will be significantly higher, leading to a density greater than Earth's 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **Planet d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    Conversely, a planet with a smaller mass than Earth will experience less gravitational compression. Therefore, its density will be lower than Earth's 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy comparing the four options, we can rank them by density:\n1.  **Planet (c)** will be the densest (>5.51 g/cm³).\n2.  **Planet (a)** and **Planet (b)** have densities that are approximately equal to Earth's (~5.51 g/cm³ and 5.5 g/cm³, respectively).\n3.  **Planet (d)** will be the least dense (<5.51 g/cm³).\n\nTherefore, the planet with the highest density is the one with the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass.\n\n<<<D>>>"
