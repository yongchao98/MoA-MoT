    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the initial parameters\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `E_M = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   The more massive fragment is `m1`, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\nFirst, let's find the sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n`E_fragments = (m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * M * c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow, we can solve for the individual rest-mass energies using the given ratio:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n*   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second:\n`2 * m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n`m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies:\n`Q = E_M - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\nIn classical mechanics, for a system initially at rest, the momenta of the two fragments are equal and opposite (`p1 = p2 = p`). The kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\nIn relativistic mechanics, we must use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\nSo, `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, which simplifies to `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`|p1*c| = |p2*c| = p*c`).\nTherefore:\n`(p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2)`\n`(p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nEquating the two expressions:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T1 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 6. Calculate the difference\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
