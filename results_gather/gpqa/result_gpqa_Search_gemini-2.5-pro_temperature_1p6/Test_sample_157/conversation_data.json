    "The scenario describes a classic dominant-negative mutation. Here's a breakdown of the concepts to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n*   **Transcription Factor Function:** The wild-type protein needs to form a dimer (pair up) to enter the nucleus and activate genes.\n*   **Heterozygous State:** The cell produces both the normal wild-type (WT) protein and the mutant (Y) protein.\n*   **Dominant-Negative Mutation:** A dominant-negative mutation produces a mutant protein that not only is non-functional itself but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the other, normal allele. This interference leads to a loss-of-function phenotype even though a normal copy of the gene is present.\n*   **Location of Mutation Y:** The mutation is in the dimerization domain. This is the crucial point. The mutant protein can still interact with a wild-type protein to form a dimer (a WT-Y heterodimer). However, this resulting dimer is non-functional because of the mutation.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n*   **A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative effect, by definition, does not result in a wild-type phenotype. While the *function* of dimerization is lost, the proteins may still physically interact.\n*   **B) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** Protein aggregation is a possible but less specific outcome. The primary mechanism described is a targeted interference between the mutant and wild-type proteins via dimerization, not necessarily uncontrolled aggregation. The phenotype is indeed loss-of-function.\n*   **C) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most likely molecular phenotype. The mutant protein (Y) dimerizes with the wild-type protein (WT). This non-functional or misfolded WT-Y complex is often recognized by cellular quality control mechanisms and targeted for degradation. This action effectively removes the functional wild-type protein from the cell, causing a \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\" and leading to a more severe phenotype than a simple loss-of-function mutation would. This mechanism, where a mutant protein causes the degradation of the wild-type protein through dimerization, is a known model for dominant-negative effects.\n*   **D) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. The prompt clearly states it's a dominant-*negative* mutation, which implies a loss of normal function, not the gain of a new or enhanced one.\n\nTherefore, the mutant protein Y dimerizes with the wild-type protein, and this faulty complex is targeted for degradation, leading to a loss of the wild-type protein's function.\n\n<<<C>>>"
