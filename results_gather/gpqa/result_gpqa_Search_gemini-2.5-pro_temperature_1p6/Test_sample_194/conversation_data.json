    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the Impact Parameter:** The transit impact parameter (`b`) is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at the midpoint of the transit, normalized by the star's radius (`R_star`). It is given by the formula:\n    `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_star`\n    where `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n2.  **Set Up Ratios:** The problem states that both planets are in the same system (so `R_star` is the same) and share the same orbital plane (so the inclination `i` is the same). We can therefore write the impact parameter equation for each planet:\n    *   Planet 1: `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_star`\n    *   Planet 2: `b2 = (a2 * cos(i)) / R_star`\n\n    By rearranging both equations to solve for `cos(i)/R_star` and setting them equal, we get:\n    `b1 / a1 = b2 / a2`\n    This can be rearranged to find `b2`:\n    `b2 = b1 * (a2 / a1)`\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** For two planets orbiting the same star, Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `(P1^2 / a1^3) = (P2^2 / a2^3)`\n\n    We can rearrange this to find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    `(a2 / a1)^3 = (P2 / P1)^2`\n    `a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:** Now, substitute the expression for `a2 / a1` from Kepler's Law into the impact parameter ratio equation:\n    `b2 = b1 * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Limiting Condition:** A transit event occurs if the planet passes in front of the stellar disk. The limiting case for this to happen is when the center of the planet grazes the edge of the star's disk, which corresponds to an impact parameter of `b = 1`. For the second planet to exhibit a transit, `b2` must be less than or equal to 1 (`b2 ≤ 1`). To find the *maximum* possible orbital period (`P2`), we must use the *maximum* possible impact parameter, which is `b2 = 1`.\n\n    (The condition for an occultation is also met if a transit occurs for a planet in a circular orbit). The information about Planet 2's radius (2.5 Earth radii) is extra detail; the condition for the transit of the planet's *center* is `b ≤ 1`.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Maximum Period:** We have the following values:\n    *   `b1` = 0.2\n    *   `P1` = 3 days\n    *   `b2` (max) = 1\n\n    Substitute these into the combined equation:\n    `1 = 0.2 * (P2_max / 3)^(2/3)`\n\n    Now, solve for `P2_max`:\n    *   `1 / 0.2 = (P2_max / 3)^(2/3)`\n    *   `5 = (P2_max / 3)^(2/3)`\n    *   Raise both sides to the power of `3/2`:\n    *   `5^(3/2) = P2_max / 3`\n    *   `P2_max = 3 * 5^(3/2)`\n    *   `P2_max = 3 * sqrt(5^3) = 3 * sqrt(125)`\n    *   `P2_max ≈ 3 * 11.18`\n    *   `P2_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<B>>>"
