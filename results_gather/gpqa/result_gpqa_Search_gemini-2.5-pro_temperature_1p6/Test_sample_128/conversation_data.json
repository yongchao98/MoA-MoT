    "Here is the step-by-step identification of Compound E:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   **Hint (a):** The reaction of Compound A with a phosphorus ylide (a Wittig reaction) yields 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The Wittig reaction converts a carbonyl group (C=O) into a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   The product name indicates that the \"propan-2-ylidene\" group (=C(CH₃)₂) comes from the ylide, replacing the carbonyl oxygen of Compound A.\n*   Therefore, Compound A must be a ketone with the carbonyl group at the 4-position of a 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane skeleton. This makes Compound A **3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one**. The numbering of the ring changes to give the ketone the lowest possible number (position 1), which places the methyl groups at positions 3 and 4.\n*   **Hint (b):** The IR spectrum of Compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm⁻¹. This absorption frequency is characteristic of a carbonyl group within a five-membered ring (a cyclopentanone). The ring strain in cyclopentanone shifts the C=O stretching frequency higher compared to a more stable six-membered ring ketone. This confirms the structure of Compound A as a cyclopentanone derivative.\n\n**Step 2: Compound A → Compound B (Cyanohydrin Formation)**\n\n*   Compound A (3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one) reacts with hydrogen cyanide (HCN).\n*   This is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group, where the cyanide ion (⁻CN) attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen is protonated to form a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   Compound B is the resulting cyanohydrin: **1-cyano-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Compound B → Compound C (Reduction)**\n\n*   Compound B is reduced with hydrogen gas (H₂) in the presence of a palladium (Pd) catalyst.\n*   This catalytic hydrogenation reduces the nitrile group (-C≡N) to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂).\n*   Compound C is **(1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentyl)methanamine**.\n\n**Step 4: Compound C → Compound D (Diazotization)**\n\n*   Compound C, a primary amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂).\n*   This reaction converts the primary amino group (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is an excellent leaving group.\n*   Compound D is the unstable diazonium ion: **[(1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentyl)methyl]diazonium**.\n\n**Step 5: Compound D → Compound E (Tiffeneau–Demjanov Rearrangement)**\n\n*   Compound D spontaneously eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂), leaving behind a highly unstable primary carbocation.\n*   This intermediate undergoes a rapid rearrangement known as the Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement, a reaction that often leads to ring expansion.\n*   A carbon-carbon bond from the cyclopentane ring migrates to the carbocation, expanding the five-membered ring into a six-membered ring. This migration forms a more stable carbocation on the carbon that was formerly part of the ring.\n*   The positive charge is then stabilized by the adjacent hydroxyl group, and after the loss of a proton, a ketone is formed.\n*   Starting with 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one, this ring expansion results in the methyl groups being on the adjacent carbons, leading to the formation of **3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n*   **Hint (b) Confirmation:** The IR spectrum of Compound E shows a strong peak around 1715 cm⁻¹. This absorption value is characteristic of a ketone in a six-membered ring (a cyclohexanone). This observation strongly supports the ring expansion from a five-membered ring (Compound A) to a six-membered ring (Compound E).\n\nBased on the reaction sequence and spectroscopic evidence, Compound E is 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n<<<B>>>"
