    "To determine which physical theory does not require regularization at high energies, we must examine the fundamental characteristics of each option. Regularization is a method used in quantum field theory to handle infinite results that arise in calculations, particularly those involving high energies (short distances).\n\n*   **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum theory of interactions between light and matter. It is a cornerstone of the Standard Model but famously requires regularization and renormalization to manage the infinities that appear in calculations involving loop diagrams. These infinities, known as ultraviolet divergences, are dealt with by introducing a parameter called a regulator, which makes the intermediate steps of a calculation finite.\n\n*   **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the theory of the strong nuclear force that binds quarks and gluons. Like QED, it is a quantum field theory that suffers from ultraviolet divergences in its perturbative calculations. Therefore, it necessitates the use of regularization techniques, such as dimensional regularization, to yield finite, physically meaningful predictions.\n\n*   **Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory describes the behavior of electric and magnetic fields and their interaction with charged particles in a non-quantum framework. It contains its own problem with infinities, most notably the infinite self-energy of a point-like charged particle. While methods can be applied to handle this singularity, which can be seen as a form of regularization, the term \"regularization at high energies\" typically refers to the systematic procedure for handling loop divergences in *quantum* field theory.\n\n*   **Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is to resolve the fundamental conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics. One of its key features is that it is believed to be free of the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that plague quantum field theories. By replacing point-like particles with one-dimensional vibrating strings, the theory smooths out interactions at very short distances, thus avoiding the infinities in the first place. For this reason, it is considered a \"UV complete\" theory that does not require the regularization procedures needed for QED and QCD.\n\nBased on this, Superstring Theory is the framework that claims to not need regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<A>>>"
