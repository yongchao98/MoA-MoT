    "To identify the correct chemical formula, we must analyze the data from each characterization technique and see which formula is consistent with all the observations.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen with a broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond and typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a common and diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n### Integration of Data and Degree of Unsaturation:\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence strongly indicates that the unknown compound contains two key functional groups: a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) and a **carbon-carbon double bond** (C=C).\n\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options **B) C₆H₁₀O** and **D) C₆H₁₂O**.\n*   We can now decide between **A) C₆H₁₀O₂** and **C) C₆H₁₂O₂** by calculating the degree of unsaturation (also known as double bond equivalents). This value represents the total number of rings and/or π-bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n    Degree of Unsaturation = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    (Where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens; oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n\n*   **For C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option A):**\n    *   Degree of Unsaturation = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of 2 is consistent with our findings: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C double bond. This formula perfectly matches the spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **For C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option C):**\n    *   Degree of Unsaturation = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of 1 would only account for the C=O of the carboxylic acid. It does not account for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by both FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the combined evidence from FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry, the unknown compound must contain a carboxylic acid and a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecular formula that fits these structural features is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
