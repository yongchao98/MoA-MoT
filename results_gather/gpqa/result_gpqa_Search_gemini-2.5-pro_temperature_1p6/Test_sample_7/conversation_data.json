  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of the Single Mutants\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant (G1 knockout):** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function reduces resistance by 25%. This indicates that G1 plays a role in pathogen resistance.\n*   **g2 mutant (G2 knockout):** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely abolishes resistance. This suggests that G2 is an essential gene in the resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant (G3 knockout):** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function reduces resistance by 50%. This indicates G3 also plays a role, and its contribution is larger than that of G1.\n\n### Analysis of the Double Mutants (Epistasis Analysis)\nEpistasis is a phenomenon where the effect of one gene is masked by the effect of another gene. In a genetic pathway, a mutation in an upstream gene is often epistatic to (masks) a mutation in a downstream gene.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance. The phenotype is identical to the g2 single mutant (0% resistance) and not the g1 single mutant (75% resistance). This means the *g2* mutation is epistatic to the *g1* mutation. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G1 in the resistance pathway.\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance. The phenotype is identical to the g2 single mutant (0% resistance) and not the g3 single mutant (50% resistance). This means the *g2* mutation is also epistatic to the *g3* mutation. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G3 as well.\n\nBased on this epistasis analysis, G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Since the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others, **G2 is the transcription factor**. It likely activates the expression of G1 and G3.\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance. This phenotype is different from both the g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) single mutants. It shows a much more severe reduction in resistance than either single mutant alone. This indicates that G1 and G3 have a synergistic interaction. When both are non-functional, the effect on resistance is greater than a simple sum of their individual effects. This type of interaction is often described as **gene redundancy** (specifically, partial redundancy), where the two genes perform similar or overlapping functions, and the presence of one can partially compensate for the loss of the other.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the given conclusions based on our analysis:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   **G2 is a transcription factor:** This is strongly supported by the data.\n    *   **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:** This is a reasonable description of their synergistic relationship.\n    *   **G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is incorrect. The double mutant g1g3 has a phenotype (10%) that is different from the g1 mutant (75%), so g1 is not epistatic to g3.\n\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   **G1 is a transcription factor:** This is incorrect; the data points to G2.\n    *   **G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This part is correct.\n    *   **G2 and G3 show pleiotropy:** Pleiotropy (a single gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be determined from this experiment, which only measures one trait (disease resistance).\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   **G2 is a transcription factor:** This is correct.\n    *   **G1 and G3 show pleiotropy:** This cannot be determined from the data.\n    *   **G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   **G2 is a transcription factor:** This is correct.\n    *   **G1 and G3 has the same promoter:** This is a molecular mechanism that cannot be confirmed by these genetic results alone.\n    *   **G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. The double mutant g1g3 has a phenotype (10%) different from the g3 mutant (50%).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A contains two strongly supported conclusions from the experiment (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\"). Although it contains one incorrect statement (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\"), it provides the best overall description of the gene interactions compared to the other options, which contain either incorrect primary conclusions (like in B) or claims that are entirely unsubstantiated by the data (pleiotropy, same promoter). The flaw in the third statement of option A is likely an error in the question's design.\n\n<<<A>>>"
