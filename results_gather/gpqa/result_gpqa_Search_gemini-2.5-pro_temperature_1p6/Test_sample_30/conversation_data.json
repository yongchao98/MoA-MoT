    "The problem describes a three-step chemical synthesis and asks for the molecular symmetry group of the final product, Product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Nitration of Toluene**\nToluene treated with a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution to yield nitrotoluene. The methyl group (-CH3) is ortho-, para-directing. This step produces a mixture of o-nitrotoluene and p-nitrotoluene. We will consider the major product, p-nitrotoluene, for the subsequent steps.\n\n*   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene\n\n**Step 2: Oxidation of Product 1**\nProduct 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This mixture is a strong oxidizing agent that oxidizes the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene to a carboxylic acid group.\n\n*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzoic acid\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2**\nProduct 2 (p-nitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. Under these conditions (a nitroaromatic compound, a ketone, and a base), a reductive dimerization of the nitro group occurs. The acetone acts as the reducing agent, becoming oxidized in the process, while the p-nitrobenzoic acid is reduced and dimerized. This reaction forms an azo compound. The most stable isomer of this product is the trans-azo derivative.\n\n*   **Product 3:** trans-4,4'-Azodibenzoic acid (or its disodium salt)\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\nThe structure of trans-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid is `HOOC-C₆H₄-N=N-C₆H₄-COOH`. The \"trans\" refers to the configuration around the central azo (-N=N-) double bond. This molecule possesses several symmetry elements:\n*   A center of inversion (i) at the midpoint of the N=N double bond.\n*   A C₂ rotation axis passing through the midpoint of the N=N bond, perpendicular to the bond and lying in the plane of the molecule.\n*   A plane of symmetry (σh) which is the plane of the molecule (assuming planarity).\n\nA molecule that has a C₂ axis, a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the axis, and a center of inversion belongs to the **C₂h** point group. The structure of trans-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid fits this description perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
