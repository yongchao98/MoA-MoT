    "A thorough analysis of the provided spectral data leads to the identification of the unknown compound. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the evidence:\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at **m/z = 156** represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** A significant peak is observed at **m/z = 158** with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. This M+2 peak, having roughly one-third the intensity of the main molecular ion peak, is a distinct signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Checking the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ gives a weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with the data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). Its wide range is a classic identifier for this functional group.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This rules out options B (which has an aldehyde and a phenol) and D (a chloroformate, which lacks an O-H group).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. Its integration as a single proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with) confirm this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 7-9 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature for a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. This symmetrical arrangement results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ¹H NMR data confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a carboxylic acid and a chlorine atom in the *para* position on a benzene ring. Its structure is perfectly consistent with all the MS, IR, and ¹H NMR data.\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data, which point to a carboxylic acid, not an aldehyde and phenol. The substitution pattern would also produce a more complex NMR spectrum.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While this is a chlorobenzoic acid, its *ortho*-substitution pattern would lead to four different signals in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, not the simple pair of doublets observed.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This lacks the carboxylic acid group required to explain the IR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\nBased on the comprehensive evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown compound is unequivocally identified.\n\n<<<A>>>"
