    "The search results confirm the validity of using conservation of energy and momentum for this problem. They also confirm the general setup where two photons are produced. The key principles are:\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before the collision (rest energy + kinetic energy of electron and positron) equals the total energy of the two photons produced.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: The total momentum of the electron and positron before the collision equals the total vectoral momentum of the two photons after.\n\nMy calculation steps are consistent with these principles.\n\n1.  **Total Initial Energy**: E_initial = E_electron + E_positron = (γ_e * m_e * c²) + (γ_p * m_e * c²) = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c².\n2.  **Photon Energy**: The two photons have equal energy, so E_photon = E_initial / 2 = 3 * m_e * c².\n3.  **Total Initial Momentum**: p_initial = p_electron + p_positron. This is a vector sum. Since they are moving along the same axis in opposite directions, it's an algebraic sum.\n    *   The momentum of a relativistic particle is p = sqrt(γ² - 1) * m * c.\n    *   p_electron = sqrt(4² - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(15) * m_e * c. (Moving left-to-right, so positive)\n    *   p_positron = -sqrt(2² - 1) * m_e * c = -sqrt(3) * m_e * c. (Moving right-to-left, so negative)\n    *   p_initial_total = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c.\n4.  **Final Momentum**: p_final = p_photon1 + p_photon2.\n    *   The magnitude of a photon's momentum is E/c. So, |p_photon| = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c.\n    *   Since the initial momentum in the y-direction is zero, and the photons have equal energy (and thus equal momentum magnitude), they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles (θ and -θ) to the horizontal axis to conserve y-momentum. The total angle between them is 2θ.\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is p_final_x = p_photon1_x + p_photon2_x = |p_photon|*cos(θ) + |p_photon|*cos(-θ) = 2 * |p_photon| * cos(θ) = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ).\n5.  **Equating Momenta**: p_initial_total = p_final_x\n    *   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n    *   cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n6.  **Calculating the Angle**:\n    *   sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298\n    *   sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205\n    *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.87298 - 1.73205) / 6 = 2.14093 / 6 ≈ 0.35682\n    *   θ = arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69.09°\n    *   The angle between the photons is 2θ ≈ 2 * 69.09° = 138.18°.\n\nThis value is extremely close to 138.\n\nThe problem seems to be a direct application of relativistic kinematics. No further information is needed.\n\nFinal answer is 138.\n\n<<<C>>>"
