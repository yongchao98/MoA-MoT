    "Here is the analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown organic compound.\n\n### 1H NMR Data Analysis:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet peak integrating to three protons is characteristic of a methyl (CH₃) group that has no adjacent protons. This is indicative of the methyl group in an acetate (CH₃COO-), which is present in all four possible compounds.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet peak integrating to three protons indicates a methyl (CH₃) group coupled to a single proton on an adjacent carbon. This matches a CH₃-CH= structure.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** A signal for one proton showing a doublet of quartets (dq) splitting pattern suggests this proton is on a carbon adjacent to both a single proton and a methyl group. This corresponds to the proton in a CH₃-CH=CH- structure. It is split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton and into a quartet by the adjacent methyl group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This doublet represents one proton in the alkene region, coupled to only one other proton. The key information here is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for vinylic protons are dependent on their stereochemistry. A large coupling constant, typically in the range of 11-18 Hz, is characteristic of protons that are in a *trans* position to each other across a double bond. Conversely, *cis* protons exhibit a smaller coupling constant, usually between 6-15 Hz.\n\n### Structure Determination:\n\n1.  The signals at 2.1 ppm (acetate methyl) and 1.6 ppm (alkene methyl) along with the alkene protons at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm confirm a propenyl acetate structure. This eliminates the butenyl acetate options.\n2.  The large coupling constant of J = 16.0 Hz for the proton at 7.0 ppm strongly indicates a *trans* configuration of the double bond.\n3.  Putting all the pieces together—an acetate group, and a trans-propenyl group (CH₃-CH=CH-)—the compound is identified as Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the chemical shifts, integration, splitting patterns, and particularly the coupling constant, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
