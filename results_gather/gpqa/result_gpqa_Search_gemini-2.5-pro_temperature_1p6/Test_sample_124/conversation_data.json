    "The problem asks for the energy and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for the third excited state of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**Energy of the System:**\nThe potential is given by `V(r) = 1/2 m ω^2 r^2`. This corresponds to a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula: `E_n = (n + 3/2)ħω`, where `n = n_x + n_y + n_z` and `n_x, n_y, n_z` are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number `n`:\n*   **Ground state (n=0):** `E_0 = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω`\n*   **First excited state (n=1):** `E_1 = (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω`\n*   **Second excited state (n=2):** `E_2 = (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω`\n*   **Third excited state (n=3):** `E_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω`\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is **(9/2)ħω**.\n\n**Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states that have that same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of different combinations of non-negative integers `(n_x, n_y, n_z)` that sum to 3.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy `g_n` of the n-th energy level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is: `g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2`.\n\nFor the third excited state, n = 3, so the degeneracy is:\n`g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10`\n\nAlternatively, we can list the possible combinations of `(n_x, n_y, n_z)` where `n_x + n_y + n_z = 3`:\n*   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) - **3 states**\n*   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) - **6 states**\n*   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1,1,1) - **1 state**\n\nThe total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 3 + 6 + 1 = **10**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   Energy: `(9/2)ħω`\n*   Degeneracy: 10\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
