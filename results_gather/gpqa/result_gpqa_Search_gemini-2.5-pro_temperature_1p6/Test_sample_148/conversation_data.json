    "Here's an analysis of the observations:\n\n*   **Â¹H NMR Data**: The presence of two peaks with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals for a single alpha-proton suggests the presence of two distinct, but very similar, chemical environments for that proton. Since these two species are in a roughly 1:1 ratio and spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this points towards a mixture of isomers.\n\n*   **LC-MS Data**: The LC-MS analysis confirms the presence of two distinct species that can be separated by liquid chromatography. The fact that both peaks exhibit the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule, rules out the possibility of contamination by a precursor (A) or a side-product from \"double coupling\" (D), as both would have different molecular masses.\n\n*   **Isomer Analysis**: The observations strongly indicate the presence of a mixture of isomers. The options are a mixture of enantiomers (C) or diastereoisomers (B).\n    *   **Enantiomers** are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by standard (achiral) LC, and they produce identical NMR spectra in an achiral solvent. This contradicts the observed data.\n    *   **Diastereomers** are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatographic techniques like LC. Furthermore, because their atoms have different spatial arrangements, they are in different chemical environments and thus give distinct signals in an NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Source of Diastereomers in Peptide Synthesis**: During chemical peptide synthesis, an amino acid's alpha-carbon can sometimes undergo a change in its stereochemistry, a process called epimerization. This converts an L-amino acid into a D-amino acid (or vice-versa). If this occurs at one chiral center in a peptide that contains other chiral centers, the result is a mixture of diastereomers. For instance, if a peptide was intended to be L-Ala-L-Val, epimerization at the valine residue would produce a mixture of L-Ala-L-Val and L-Ala-D-Val. These two molecules are diastereomers. Another possibility in peptides is the existence of *cis-trans* isomers around a peptide bond, which are also a form of diastereomers. Both epimerization and cis-trans isomerism would lead to duplicate peaks in the NMR and separable peaks in the LC, all with the same mass.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe observation of two separable peaks in the LC-MS with identical mass, combined with two distinct peaks for an alpha-proton in the NMR spectrum, is classic evidence for the presence of diastereomers. This is a known potential side reaction in chemical peptide synthesis, often due to epimerization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
