    "To arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must first classify the substituents on the benzene ring and then analyze their directing effects and any steric hindrance they may cause.\n\n### **Substituent Classification and Directing Effects:**\n\nThe substituents are classified as follows:\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the benzene ring, making it less reactive towards electrophiles. They direct incoming substituents to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer. The groups in this category are:\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating.\n    *   **-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating.\n*   **Ortho/Para-directing groups:** These groups direct incoming substituents to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-CH₃ (Toluene, 1):** Activating group.\n    *   **-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Activating group.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Deactivating group, but directs ortho/para.\n\n### **Determining the Order:**\n\nThe order is determined by comparing the percentage yield of the para-isomer for each substance's bromination.\n\n1.  **Lowest Para-Isomer Yield (Meta-directors):**\n    The substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The strength of the deactivating effect generally correlates with a stronger preference for the meta position, and thus a lower para-yield.\n    *   **Nitrobenzene (-NO₂):** The -NO₂ group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. During nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution), it yields only a trace amount (0-5%) of the para-isomer, with the vast majority (90-95%) being the meta-isomer. Bromination is similar, producing the meta-bromo isomer as the main product. Therefore, nitrobenzene (4) will have the lowest para-yield.\n    *   **Benzoic acid (-COOH) and Ethyl benzoate (-COOC₂H₅):** Both groups are deactivating and meta-directing. Data for the nitration of ethyl benzoate shows a para-yield of about 5%, with 73% meta and 22% ortho. The carboxylate group (-COOH) is also strongly meta-directing. In bromination, ethyl benzoate (2) yields slightly more para-isomer than benzoic acid (6). Thus, the order among these is 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n2.  **Highest Para-Isomer Yield (Ortho/Para-directors):**\n    For the ortho/para directors, the distribution between the two positions depends largely on steric hindrance. A bulkier group will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n    *   **Toluene (-CH₃) vs. Ethylbenzene (-C₂H₅):** Both are activating, ortho/para-directing alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is larger than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric bulk near the ortho positions in ethylbenzene results in a greater preference for substitution at the less hindered para position compared to toluene. Therefore, the para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene (5) is higher than for toluene (1).\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** Halogens are an interesting case. Although they are deactivating overall due to their inductive effect, they are ortho/para-directing because of their resonance effect. The steric hindrance and strong inductive effect of chlorine significantly favor the para position over the ortho position. For instance, the nitration of chlorobenzene yields 70% of the para-isomer. Conventional bromination of chlorobenzene also yields the para isomer as the substantial product over the ortho isomer. This high selectivity for the para position means chlorobenzene (3) will have a very high para-isomer yield, generally the highest among this group.\n\n### **Final Ordering:**\n\nCombining these analyses, the predicted isomer yields are:\n*   (4) Nitrobenzene: Lowest para yield (<1%)\n*   (6) Benzoic Acid: Very low para yield (~1-2%)\n*   (2) Ethyl Benzoate: Low para yield (~5-10%)\n*   (1) Toluene: Moderate para yield (~30-40%)\n*   (5) Ethylbenzene: High para yield (> para from toluene due to sterics)\n*   (3) Chlorobenzene: Very high para yield (~90%)\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
