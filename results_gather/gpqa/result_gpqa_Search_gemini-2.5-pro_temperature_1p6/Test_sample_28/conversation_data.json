    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the most effective mutation would be one that results in a non-functional protein. This is most reliably achieved by a mutation that halts protein synthesis very early. Let's analyze the options by reading the DNA sequence in triplets (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n    This sequence codes for the amino acids: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine...\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    The second codon, `TTT`, has changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for the amino acid Phenylalanine, so this is a silent mutation. The third codon, `CTC`, has changed to `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine, while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine. This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid. While this could alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    The third codon, `CTC`, has changed to `TAA`. In the genetic code, `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to stop prematurely. The resulting product would be a tiny, truncated protein consisting of only two amino acids, which would almost certainly be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    This sequence has two changes compared to the intact gene. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) has changed to `GTC` (Valine). These are both **missense mutations**. While two amino acid changes might have a greater impact than one, it is still not as definitive at eliminating function as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...-3’`\n    The third codon `CTC` has been changed to `TAC`. This results in a single amino acid change from Leucine to Tyrosine. This is a **missense mutation**, similar to Mutant 1, and is not the most likely option to completely eliminate the protein's function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating the function of the protein is the nonsense mutation found in Mutant 2. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced.\n\n<<<B>>>"
