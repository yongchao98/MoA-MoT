    "To determine the mean decay distance of the X meson resonance, a multi-step calculation is required, involving principles from special relativity and quantum mechanics.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n\n1.  **Lifetime Calculation:** The lifetime (τ) of a particle is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ). The relationship is given by the formula τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Given Decay Width, Γ = 320 MeV\n    *   Reduced Planck Constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s\n    *   τ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n2.  **Lorentz Factor and Velocity:** The Lorentz factor (γ) accounts for the effects of time dilation and is calculated as the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass (m).\n    *   Energy, E = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n    *   Mass, m = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n    *   γ = E / m = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20/3 ≈ 6.67\n    The velocity (β), in units of the speed of light (c), can be derived from the Lorentz factor: β = √(1 - 1/γ²).\n    *   β = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √391/400 ≈ 0.9887\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance:** Due to time dilation, a relativistic particle travels a greater distance in the laboratory frame before decaying. The mean decay distance (d) is given by the formula d = β * γ * c * τ, where 'c' is the speed of light.\n    *   Speed of light, c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   d = (√391/20) * (20/3) * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n    *   d ≈ 4.067 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThe calculated mean decay distance is approximately 4.067 x 10⁻¹⁵ meters. Comparing this result with the given options, the closest value is 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
