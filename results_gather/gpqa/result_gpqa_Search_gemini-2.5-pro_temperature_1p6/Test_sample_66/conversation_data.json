    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of orbital angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, of two electrons and finding that both have an eigenvalue of -ħ. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m₁` and `m₂` both being -1.\n\nThe two-electron system is described by the coupled angular momentum state `|l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ = |1, 1, 2, -1⟩`.\n*   `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1` are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons (since they are in p orbitals).\n*   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m = -1` is the magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum, `Lz`.\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. Therefore, the quantum number `m` must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, `m₁` and `m₂`:\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nIn this problem, the state of the system has `m = -1`. We are asked for the probability of finding the system in a state where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\nLet's check the sum of these individual quantum numbers:\n`m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nThis sum (`-2`) does not equal the system's total magnetic quantum number `m` (`-1`).\n\nWhen a measurement of `L₁z` and `L₂z` is performed, the system's state `|1, 1, 2, -1⟩` will collapse into one of the uncoupled states `|l₁, m₁⟩|l₂, m₂⟩` that constitute it. The only uncoupled states that can contribute to the `|1, 1, 2, -1⟩` state are those for which the condition `m₁ + m₂ = -1` is satisfied. The possible combinations for `(m₁, m₂)` are `(-1, 0)` and `(0, -1)`.\n\nThe state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1⟩` is not a component of the superposition that forms the state `|l=2, m=-1⟩`. Therefore, there is zero probability of measuring the system and finding it in this state.\n\nThe joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both `L₁z` and `L₂z` as -ħ is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>"
