    "This problem requires evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a radial vector field, `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. There are two primary methods to approach this: direct calculation of the divergence and application of the Divergence Theorem.\n\n### Method 1: Direct Calculation of the Divergence\n\nThe formula for the divergence of a vector field `f` in spherical coordinates is:\n`∇·f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + ...` (angular terms)\n\nGiven that the field `f(r)` only has a radial component `f_r = 1/r^2`, the angular components are zero. Plugging `f_r` into the formula:\n`∇·f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`\n\nThis calculation suggests the divergence is zero. However, this is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin (`r = 0`), the vector field itself is undefined, creating a singularity. A naive integration of `∇·f = 0` over the volume would incorrectly yield a result of 0. The singularity at the origin, which acts as a source, must be properly accounted for. In the language of distributions, the divergence of this specific field is represented by the Dirac delta function: `∇·(r̂/r^2) = 4πδ(r)`.\n\nIntegrating this over the volume of the sphere:\n`∫_V (∇·f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ(r) dV`\n\nSince the sphere is centered at the origin, it contains the point `r=0`. The property of the Dirac delta function is that its integral over a volume containing the origin is 1. Therefore:\n`∫_V (∇·f) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`\n\n### Method 2: The Divergence (Gauss's) Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface bounding the volume:\n`∫_V (∇·f) dV = ∮_S f · dS`\n\nThis theorem provides a more direct way to solve the problem, effectively handling the singularity at the origin by examining the flux through the enclosing surface.\n\n1.  **Vector Field on the Surface:** The surface `S` is a sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the vector field is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n2.  **Surface Element:** The differential surface area element `dS` in spherical coordinates for a sphere of radius R is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂`. The normal vector points radially outward.\n3.  **Dot Product:** The dot product `f · dS` represents the flux through the infinitesimal surface area.\n    `f · dS = ((1/R^2) * r̂) · (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂) = sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n4.  **Surface Integral:** To find the total flux, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the polar angle `θ` are 0 to `π`, and for the azimuthal angle `φ` are 0 to `2π`.\n    `∮_S f · dS = ∫_0^(2π) ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    Evaluating the inner integral:\n    `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`\n\n    Evaluating the outer integral:\n    `∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]_0^(2π) = 4π`\n\nBoth methods, when correctly applied, yield the same result. The calculation of the flux using the Divergence Theorem avoids the complexities of the singularity and shows that a surprising result of `4π` is obtained even though the divergence appears to be zero everywhere except the origin. The physical interpretation is that there is a source at the origin, and the total flux out of any sphere enclosing it is `4π`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated answer is 4π.\n\n<<<B>>>"
