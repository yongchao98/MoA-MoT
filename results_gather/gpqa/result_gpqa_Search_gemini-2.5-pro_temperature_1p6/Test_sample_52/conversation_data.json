    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring with two substituents, having the formula C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. This adds a carbonyl group (C=O) and a C-O single bond to the structure, along with two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR Data:**\n        *   **Six total signals.**\n        *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** This is consistent with a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring, which would show two signals (two doublets) due to symmetry.\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (doublet and doublet of quartets):** The vinyl region of an NMR spectrum corresponds to protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). A signal that is a doublet of quartets (dq) is characteristic of a proton that is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and also to a methyl group of three protons (giving the quartet). This splitting pattern, along with the other doublet, strongly indicates the presence of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   **Two -CH3 signals:** One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The second methyl group must be part of the ester, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OOCCH3).\n        *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence that helps eliminate other possibilities.\n\n2.  **Assemble the structural fragments:**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: C6H4\n    *   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3, which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   An ester group containing one methyl group. This can be either a methyl ester fragment (-COOCH3, formula C2H3O2) or an acetate fragment (-OOCCH3, formula C2H3O2). Both possibilities have the same atomic composition.\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = 11 carbons\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = 12 hydrogens\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = 2 oxygens\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the proposed formula and structure against the given constraints:**\n    *   A possible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. This molecule is C11H12O2. It has a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester, a propenyl group, two distinct methyl groups, and importantly, no -CH2- groups. This structure fits all the provided data.\n    *   Let's check the other formula options:\n        *   **C12H14O2:** Compared to C11H12O2, this formula has an additional CH2. For example, ethyl 4-propenylbenzoate (C12H14O2) would contain an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) and thus a -CH2- signal in the NMR, which contradicts the given data.\n        *   **C11H14O2:** This formula has two more hydrogens than C11H12O2. To accommodate these hydrogens, the double bond of the propenyl group would need to be saturated (i.e., a propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3). This would eliminate the vinyl-H signals and introduce -CH2- signals, both of which contradict the data.\n        *   **C12H12O2:** This formula has an extra degree of unsaturation compared to the structure we derived. It is inconsistent with the functional groups identified from the spectra.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only chemical formula that fits all the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
