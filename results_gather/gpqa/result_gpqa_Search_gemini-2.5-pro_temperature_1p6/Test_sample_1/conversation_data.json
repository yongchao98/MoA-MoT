    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in product 3.\n\n**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide → product 1**\n\n*   **trans-cinnamaldehyde** (C₆H₅CH=CHCHO) is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. It has a total of 9 carbon atoms (6 in the phenyl ring, 2 in the double bond, and 1 in the aldehyde group).\n*   **Methylmagnesium bromide** (CH₃MgBr) is a Grignard reagent. In this reaction, the methyl group (CH₃) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde in a 1,2-addition.\n*   This reaction adds one carbon atom to the molecule.\n*   **Product 1** is 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol (C₆H₅CH=CHCH(OH)CH₃). The aldehyde is converted into a secondary alcohol.\n*   The number of carbon atoms in product 1 is 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n**Step 2: product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) → product 2**\n\n*   **Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)** is an oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols into ketones.\n*   The reaction oxidizes the secondary alcohol group in product 1 without affecting the carbon-carbon double bond or the phenyl ring. No carbon atoms are added or removed in this step.\n*   **Product 2** is 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, also known as benzalacetone (C₆H₅CH=CHC(=O)CH₃).\n*   The number of carbon atoms in product 2 remains 10.\n\n**Step 3: product 2 + (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane → product 3**\n\n*   The prompt has a typographical error, referring to \"3 was treated...\". The correct reactant is product 2.\n*   **(Dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**, also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent or dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, reacts with α,β-unsaturated ketones to form cyclopropanes.\n*   The reagent adds a methylene group (–CH₂–) across the carbon-carbon double bond of the α,β-unsaturated ketone (a conjugate addition or cyclopropanation).\n*   This reaction adds one carbon atom to the molecule.\n*   **Product 3** is 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one. The structure consists of a phenyl group and an acetyl group attached to adjacent carbons of a cyclopropane ring.\n*   The number of carbon atoms in product 3 is 10 (from product 2) + 1 (from the reagent) = 11. The chemical formula for this product is C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\nTherefore, product 3 has a total of 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
