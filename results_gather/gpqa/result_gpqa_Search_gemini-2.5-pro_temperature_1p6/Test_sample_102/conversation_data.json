    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has three substituents—acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups—all in a *meta* relationship to each other (at positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\n### Analysis of the Synthetic Route:\n\nThe key to an efficient synthesis is to install the groups in an order that utilizes their directing effects to achieve the desired substitution pattern.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Introduction of a Director.** We must start by adding a group to the benzene ring. The type of group added first will determine the position of the second substituent.\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a *meta*-director.\n    *   A bromine group (-Br) is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) is a *meta*-director.\n\n    To achieve the all-*meta* substitution pattern, it is logical to begin by introducing a *meta*-directing group. This points towards either Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add -COCH₃) or nitration (to add -NO₂) as the first step.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Addition of the Second Substituent.**\n    *   **Path A: Friedel-Crafts Acylation First.** Reacting benzene with acetyl chloride (CH₃COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl₃ yields acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. Therefore, the subsequent bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) will place the bromine atom at the *meta* position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Addition of the Final Substituent.**\n    *   Starting from 3-bromoacetophenone, a nitration reaction (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) is performed. The ring now has two directing groups: the acetyl group at position 1 (*meta*-director) and the bromo group at position 3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The bromo group directs incoming groups to its *ortho* positions (2 and 4) and its *para* position (5).\n    *   Since both groups direct the incoming electrophile to position 5, their directing effects are cooperative, leading to the high-yield formation of the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### Evaluation of the Given Options:\n\n*   **Option A:** i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄... This sequence follows the precise logic outlined above for the first three steps, successfully producing the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically nonsensical for the stated goal but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, crucial reactions.\n*   **Option B:** This sequence begins with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline. Attempting a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (step iii) is problematic, as the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and making the reaction fail.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence involves nitration, reduction, diazotization, and then deamination (step iv), which would regenerate benzene, making the initial steps pointless.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence starts with bromination, adding an *ortho, para*-director. The following nitration (step ii) would yield *ortho* and *para* products, not the required *meta* isomer. Furthermore, Friedel-Crafts reactions (step iii) fail on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sequence of reactions presented in option A is the only viable pathway to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one with a high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>"
