    "An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with its symmetry axis along the z-axis can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The power radiated by such a dipole is not uniform in all directions.\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle ($dP/d\\Omega$) for an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n\n$dP/d\\Omega \\propto \\sin^2(\\theta)$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis in this case).\n\nThe radiated power is at its maximum when $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ is at its maximum. The maximum value of $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ is 1, which occurs at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis). Let this maximum power be denoted by A.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of $\\theta = 30^\\circ$, we evaluate $\\sin^2(30^\\circ)$:\n\n$\\sin(30^\\circ) = 1/2$\n$\\sin^2(30^\\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$\n\nThus, the power radiated at $30^\\circ$ is 1/4 of the maximum power, A.\n\nAccording to the Larmor formula and its extensions to oscillating dipoles, the total power radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the oscillation frequency ($\\omega^4$). Since frequency ($\\omega$) is inversely proportional to wavelength ($\\lambda$), the radiated power has a wavelength dependence of $\\lambda^{-4}$. This principle is also fundamental to Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue, as shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more strongly. The power per unit solid angle, `f`, will also follow this wavelength dependence.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of A radiated at an angle of $30^\\circ$ is 1/4, and a possible form for the wavelength-dependent part of the function `f` is $\\lambda^{-4}$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
