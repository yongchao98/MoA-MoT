    "This is a chemical equilibrium problem that can be solved by calculating the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) and thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) form a series of complexes. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species is given by:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**2. Use Stability Constants**\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (β):\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**3. Calculate the Mole Fraction**\n\nThe mole fraction (α) of a specific complex, in this case, the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)₂], represents its percentage relative to the total cobalt concentration. The formula for the mole fraction of [Co(SCN)₂], denoted as α₂, is derived by substituting the equilibrium expressions into the total concentration equation.\n\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe free cobalt concentration [Co²⁺] cancels out, simplifying the expression to:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Substitute the Given Values**\n\nWe are given:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M (Since the total cobalt concentration is much lower, we can assume the free thiocyanate concentration is approximately its initial concentration).\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of each term in the denominator:\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum these terms to find the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nNow, calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThus, the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
