    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and present in a form that is not a racemic (50/50) mixture of enantiomers. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which most commonly occurs when it contains a stereocenter and lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Based on these principles, four of the compounds listed will exhibit optical activity.\n\nAn analysis of each compound reveals the following:\n*   ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule does not contain a traditional chiral carbon. However, the groups attached to the double bond carbons are different (C1 has H and Cl; C2 has methyl and ethyl), and the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry, making it a chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n*   ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione***: The name specifies a single, complex stereoisomer with designated chiral centers (3aR, 7aS). Such complex molecules with specific stereochemistry are chiral and thus **optically active**.\n*   ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This compound has two chiral centers, but the (2R, 3S) configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n*   ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This molecule has two chiral centers, and this specific configuration (2R, 3R) lacks a plane of symmetry. It is a chiral diastereomer of the meso form and is **optically active**.\n*   ***(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol***: The name designates a specific enantiomer, (R), of a molecule with a chiral center at the first carbon. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always **optically active**.\n*   ***(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol***: This notation describes the *cis*-isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This arrangement results in a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and **optically inactive**.\n*   ***1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one***: The structure of this molecule is (CH₃)₂CHCH₂C(=O)C₅H₉. It does not contain any chiral centers and possesses a plane of symmetry, rendering it achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nIn summary, the four optically active compounds are (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, and (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
