    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **1. Analysis of Compound X's Structure using Spectral Data**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption between **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of a C=C stretch from an aromatic ring.\n    *   From the IR data, we can infer that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded, broad singlet for one proton confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the 7.2 ppm signal is from the protons adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   This establishes the core structure as a *para*-substituted benzoic acid.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons is likely the methylene group adjacent to the methyl group. This forms an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton, which is significantly downfield, suggesting it is a benzylic proton (attached to the benzene ring) and is split by several neighboring protons.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The fragments [-CH₂CH₃] and [-CH(CH₃)-] connect at the CH carbon, which is also attached to the benzene ring. This forms a **sec-butyl group**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Based on the combined spectral data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option **D**.\n\n### **2. Reaction and Final Product Identification**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to the corresponding alkanes (specifically, to a methyl group, -CH₃). The red phosphorus serves to regenerate HI from the iodine (I₂) formed during the reaction, allowing it to be used in catalytic amounts.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group. The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring remain unchanged.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, also known as 4-sec-butyltoluene.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Options**\n*   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches our predicted final product.\n*   **B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** This is an incorrect structure and is still a carboxylic acid, not a reduced product.\n*   **C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** This has an isobutyl group, which is inconsistent with the NMR data of the starting material.\n*   **D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material, Compound X, not the final product.\n\nThe correct final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
