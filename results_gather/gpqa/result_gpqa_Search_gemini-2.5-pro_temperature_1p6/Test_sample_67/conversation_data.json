    "This is a classic problem in quantum mechanics known as Larmor precession. When the magnetic field is switched from the +Z direction to the +Y direction, the particle's magnetic moment begins to precess around the new magnetic field axis (+Y).\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's spin is aligned with the magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a spin-up state with respect to the z-axis.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the new Hamiltonian governing the system is proportional to the spin operator in the Y direction (`Sy`).\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The spin state of the particle evolves under this new Hamiltonian. The expectation value of the spin components will change with time.\n\n4.  **Precession**: The expectation value of the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (+Y). This means that the components of the spin perpendicular to Y (i.e., Sx and Sz) will oscillate. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe angular frequency of this Larmor precession is given by the formula:\nω = γB\n\nwhere:\n*   ω is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   γ (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the particle.\n*   B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz(t)>`, is directly proportional to the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz(t)>`. As `<Sz(t)>` oscillates, so does `<μz(t)>`.\n\nThe calculation of the expectation value `<Sz(t)>` shows that it oscillates as `cos(γBt)`. Therefore, the angular frequency of the oscillation is `γB`. This phenomenon is fundamental to technologies like Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The frequency is independent of the initial orientation of the spin relative to the new field.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γ*B`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
