    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of non-Gaussianity (nG)**\n\nThe measure of non-Gaussianity, `del_b`, is given by the relative entropy between the state of interest, `rho`, and a reference Gaussian state, `tau`. The formula provided is:\n`del_b = [trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(tau * ln(tau))]`\n\nThis can be rewritten in terms of von Neumann entropy, `S(rho) = -trace(rho * ln(rho))`.\n`del_b = -S(rho) - (-S(tau)) = S(tau) - S(rho)`\nThe reference Gaussian state `tau` is defined as the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as the state `rho`.\n\n**2. Analyze the State `rho`**\n\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n`|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\nFor the given parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`:\n*   `cos(-pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)`\n*   `sin(-pi/4) = -1/sqrt(2)`\nThe state `|psi>` becomes an \"odd cat state\":\n`|psi> = (1/(N*sqrt(2))) * (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`\nThis is a pure quantum state. The density matrix is `rho = |psi><psi|`.\n\nFor any pure state, the von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` is zero. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity simplifies to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`del_b = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau)`.\n\n**3. Determine the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nWe need to find the Gaussian state `tau` that matches the first and second moments of `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moment (Mean Displacement):**\n    The mean displacement is `<a> = <psi|a|psi>`. For an odd cat state, this value is zero. Thus, the reference state `tau` is centered at the origin of the phase space and is a squeezed thermal state.\n\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance Matrix):**\n    A squeezed thermal state is characterized by two parameters: a squeezing parameter `r` and a thermal photon number `N_th`. Its entropy is equivalent to the entropy of a thermal state with `N_th` photons. The moments of this state are:\n    *   `<n> = <a_dagger a> = N_th * cosh(2r) + sinh^2(r)`\n    *   `<m> = <a^2> = (N_th + 1/2) * sinh(2r)` (assuming a real squeezing parameter as `<m>` will be real).\n\n    We now calculate these moments for our cat state `rho`:\n    *   The average photon number for the odd cat state is given by the formula `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`.\n    *   The squeezing parameter can be calculated as `<m> = <psi|a^2|psi> = alpha^2`.\n\n**4. Solve for the Parameters of `tau`**\n\nWe match the moments of `rho` and `tau` to solve for `N_th` and `r`:\n1.  `alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2) = N_th * cosh(2r) + sinh^2(r)`\n2.  `alpha^2 = (N_th + 1/2) * sinh(2r)`\n\nFrom equation (2), we get `(N_th + 1/2) = alpha^2 / sinh(2r)`.\nSubstitute this into equation (1) after using `cosh(2r)/sinh(2r) = coth(2r)` and `sinh^2(r) = (cosh(2r)-1)/2`:\n`alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2) = (alpha^2 / sinh(2r)) * cosh(2r) - 1/2 + 1/2 * cosh(2r)` ... this becomes complicated.\n\nLet's use a more direct algebraic substitution. From (2), we substitute `(N_th + 1/2)` into (1) using identities:\n`alpha^2 coth(alpha^2) = (N_th + 1/2 - 1/2)cosh(2r) + sinh^2(r)`\n`alpha^2 coth(alpha^2) = (N_th + 1/2)cosh(2r) - 1/2 cosh(2r) + sinh^2(r)`\n`alpha^2 coth(alpha^2) = (alpha^2/sinh(2r))cosh(2r) - 1/2 cosh(2r) + (cosh(2r)-1)/2`\n`alpha^2 coth(alpha^2) = alpha^2 coth(2r) - 1/2`\n`alpha^2 * (coth(2r) - coth(alpha^2)) = 1/2`\n`coth(2r) = coth(alpha^2) + 1 / (2*alpha^2)`\n\nNow, we plug in `alpha = 0.5` (`alpha^2 = 0.25`):\n`coth(2r) = coth(0.25) + 1 / (2 * 0.25) = coth(0.25) + 2`\n`coth(0.25) approx 4.0831`\n`coth(2r) approx 6.0831`\n\nNow we can find `sinh(2r)` using the identity `csch^2(x) = coth^2(x) - 1`:\n`sinh(2r) = 1 / csch(2r) = 1 / sqrt(coth^2(2r) - 1)`\n`sinh(2r) = 1 / sqrt((6.0831)^2 - 1) = 1 / sqrt(37.004 - 1) = 1 / sqrt(36.004) approx 1/6`\n\nFinally, we find `N_th` from equation (2):\n`alpha^2 = (N_th + 1/2) * sinh(2r)`\n`0.25 = (N_th + 1/2) * (1/6)`\n`1.5 = N_th + 1/2`\n`N_th = 1`\n\n**5. Calculate the final non-Gaussianity**\n\nThe thermal photon number of the reference state `tau` is exactly 1. The non-Gaussianity is the entropy of this thermal component. The entropy of a thermal state is given by:\n`S(N_th) = (N_th + 1) * ln(N_th + 1) - N_th * ln(N_th)`\nFor `N_th = 1`:\n`del_b = S(1) = (1 + 1) * ln(1 + 1) - 1 * ln(1)`\n`del_b = 2 * ln(2) - 0`\n`del_b approx 2 * 0.693 = 1.386`\n\nThe calculated amount of non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.38.\n\n<<<B>>>"
