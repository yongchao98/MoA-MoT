    "To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of stoichiometric and equilibrium calculations.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nIron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, is a sparingly soluble base that reacts with a strong monobasic acid (like HCl, which provides H⁺ ions) in a neutralization reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the dissolution is:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we determine the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample:\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / molar mass\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n**3. Determine the Stoichiometric Amount of Acid**\n\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions. Therefore, we can calculate the moles of H⁺ needed to react completely with the Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Moles of H⁺ = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid. We can now calculate this volume:\n*   Volume = Moles / Molarity\n*   Volume = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L\n*   Volume in cm³ = 0.02807 L × 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is the stoichiometric amount required for the neutralization reaction. This value is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option A.\n\n**4. Determine the pH of the Resulting Solution**\n\nWhen the stoichiometric amount of acid is added, the Fe(OH)₃ is converted into Fe³⁺ ions. The final solution contains 0.00093575 moles of Fe³⁺ in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L), as stated in the problem.\n*   [Fe³⁺] = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.00936 M.\n\nThe iron(III) ion (more accurately, the hexaaquairon(III) ion, [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺) is a weak acid and hydrolyzes in water, releasing H⁺ ions and lowering the pH:\n[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n\nTo determine if the stoichiometric amount of acid is sufficient, we must check if the Fe(OH)₃ will remain dissolved at the pH created by this hydrolysis. This requires comparing the ion product (Qsp) to the solubility product constant (Ksp) for Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 2.79 × 10⁻³⁹.\n*   The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ has a pKa of about 2.2, so Ka ≈ 6.3 × 10⁻³.\n\nCalculating the pH of the 0.00936 M Fe³⁺ solution:\nKa = [H⁺]² / ([Fe³⁺] - [H⁺])\n6.3 × 10⁻³ = x² / (0.00936 - x)\nSolving the quadratic equation gives [H⁺] ≈ 0.00515 M, which corresponds to a pH of approximately 2.29.\n\nAt this pH (2.29), the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻] would be very low, ensuring that the ion product `[Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³` is far below the Ksp value. This confirms that adding just the stoichiometric amount of acid is sufficient to completely dissolve the Fe(OH)₃. Therefore, the minimum volume is indeed the stoichiometric volume.\n\nThe calculated minimum volume (28.07 cm³) and the resulting pH (≈2.29) point strongly towards option A.\n*   Calculated: V ≈ 28.07 cm³, pH ≈ 2.29\n*   Option A: V = 28.05 cm³, pH = 2.04\n\nThe minor discrepancy in the pH value is likely due to the use of a slightly different Ka value for the hydrolysis of the iron(III) ion in the source of the question. However, the volume calculation is robust and aligns almost perfectly with option A.\n\nFinal check:\nThe volume 28.05 cm³ corresponds to the stoichiometric amount needed for the reaction. The pH of the resulting iron(III) salt solution is acidic, as expected. Option A is the only choice that provides the correct stoichiometric volume.\n\n<<<A>>>"
