    "The multistep synthesis problem can be solved by deducing the structure of the products at each stage.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, is reacted with an excess of strong base (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). This suggests a complex rearrangement rather than a simple substitution. The resulting Product 1 is described as a light yellow solid with an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a non-conjugated ketone. The 1H NMR spectrum shows signals for 14 protons, with a notable peak at 4.79 ppm integrating to 2H. This highly deshielded signal is indicative of two equivalent vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond). The presence of a double bond is further confirmed by the ozonolysis reaction in step 3. The formula, C10H14O, along with the spectroscopic data, points to a rearranged bicyclic structure. A plausible structure for **Product 1 is bicyclo[4.3.1]dec-3-en-8-one**. This molecule has the correct formula, an unconjugated ketone, and a plane of symmetry that makes the two vinylic protons at C3 and C4 equivalent, consistent with the NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces a ketone to an alcohol. Therefore, **Product 2 is bicyclo[4.3.1]dec-3-en-8-ol**. This product retains the double bond necessary for the next step.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is subjected to ozonolysis (O3) followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This reaction cleaves the double bond (C3=C4) and converts the carbons of the double bond into aldehydes. Since the original double bond had a hydrogen atom on each carbon (-CH=CH-), the cleavage results in two aldehyde groups (-CHO). The cleavage of the bond within the bicyclic system's largest ring results in an 8-membered ring (a cyclooctane derivative) bearing two side chains with aldehyde groups and the original alcohol group. The aldehyde groups are attached to what were originally carbons C2 and C5 of the bicycloalkane. In the precursor, these were CH2 groups.\n\n**Determining the Coupling Pattern**\n\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded, non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, the aldehyde protons (-CHO) are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons, typically found in the 9-10 ppm region of an NMR spectrum.\n*   **Coupling:** To determine the splitting pattern of an aldehyde proton, we apply the n+1 rule, where 'n' is the number of protons on the adjacent carbon atom. In the structure of Product 3, each aldehyde group is attached to a carbon atom that was a CH2 group in the bicyclic precursor. Thus, the aldehyde proton is adjacent to a CH2 group.\n*   **Pattern:** With two neighboring protons (n=2), the aldehyde proton's signal will be split into (2+1) = 3 peaks. This pattern is called a **triplet**. While the two protons on the adjacent CH2 group are technically diastereotopic and could have different coupling constants (which would result in a doublet of doublets), in many cases, the coupling constants are similar enough that the signal appears as a triplet. Given the options, \"triplet\" is the most appropriate and expected description.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a triplet.\n\n<<<C>>>"
