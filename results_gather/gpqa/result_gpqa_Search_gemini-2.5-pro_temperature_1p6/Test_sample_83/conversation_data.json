    "In the context of solving higher-dimensional heat equations with the described numerical methods, the key factor for converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one is the ability to use a partial fraction decomposition. When the matrix exponential function `exp(A)` is approximated by a rational function `R(A)`, parallelism is often achieved by splitting the task.\n\nThe process works as follows:\n1.  The implicit time-stepping scheme leads to a large system of linear equations.\n2.  Approximating the matrix exponential function with a fractional (rational) approximation is a common technique in these methods.\n3.  The core idea for parallelization is to decompose this rational function into a sum of simpler terms using a partial fraction expansion.\n4.  This decomposition allows the single, large computational task to be broken down into several smaller, independent sub-tasks. Each of these sub-tasks corresponds to a term in the partial fraction expansion and can be solved concurrently on a different processor.\n\nTherefore, the linear partial fraction expansion of the fractional approximation is the mathematical technique that directly enables the splitting of the problem into parallelizable parts.\n\n<<<A>>>"
