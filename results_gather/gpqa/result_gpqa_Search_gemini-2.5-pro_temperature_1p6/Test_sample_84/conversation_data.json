    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1. Formula for Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of an exoplanet is calculated using the following formula:\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the albedo of the planet.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\nAccording to the problem description, both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are identical for both. It is also stated that both planets have the same albedo (`A_1` = `A_2`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, which we can use to determine the semi-major axes. The radial velocity amplitude (K) of the star caused by a planet on a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n(This formula assumes the planet was detected by the transit method, meaning the orbit is edge-on and sin(i) ≈ 1).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\n\na = G * M_p^2 / (M_star * K^2)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n\na_2 / a_1 = [G * M_p2^2 / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [G * M_p1^2 / (M_star * K_1^2)]\n\nThe terms `G` and `M_star` are the same for both and cancel out, leaving:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude `K` is related to the Doppler shift `Δλ` by `K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. The ratio `K_1 / K_2` is therefore equal to `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nWe can now insert the values provided in the problem:\n\n*   Planet masses: M_p1 = 7 M_earth, M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shifts: Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å, Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, calculate the ratios:\n\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, substitute these ratios into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n**4. Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, substitute the value of `a_2 / a_1` back into the simplified equilibrium temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
