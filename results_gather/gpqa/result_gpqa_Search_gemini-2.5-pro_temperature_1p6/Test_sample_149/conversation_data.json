    "The step-by-step chemical transformation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Starting Material:**\n    The molecular formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5, which suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group).\n    The 1H-NMR data is interpreted as follows:\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** An aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to an adjacent CH2 group.\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** A para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A primary amine group (-NH2).\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** A CH2 group coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n    Based on this data, the starting compound is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Step 1 & 2: Diazotization and Hydrolysis (NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O):**\n    A primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) reacts with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and a strong acid like HCl at low temperatures to form a diazonium salt (Ar-N2+Cl-). This reaction is known as diazotization. When this diazonium salt is warmed in the presence of water, the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a phenol and releasing nitrogen gas.\n    Thus, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Base-Catalyzed Aldol Condensation (aq. KOH, Heat):**\n    4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has both a carbonyl group (aldehyde) and acidic α-protons (on the carbon adjacent to the aldehyde). In the presence of a base like KOH, it undergoes a self-aldol reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n    *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The \"Heat\" specified in the reaction conditions indicates that the aldol addition product will undergo dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon and a proton from the α-carbon are eliminated, creating a double bond between the α and β carbons.\n    The resulting product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This structure is stabilized by conjugation of the double bond with both the aldehyde group and one of the phenyl rings.\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final condensation product expected with heat.\n*   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: This structure lacks the hydroxyl groups on the phenyl rings.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: This product has an incorrect molecular structure and does not account for the dimerization of the starting aldehyde.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This matches the structure derived from the self-aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
