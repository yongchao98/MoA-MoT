    "To determine the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n`V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`\n\nThe transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is:\n`x = r cos(θ)`\n`y = r sin(θ)`\nAnd `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n\nSubstitute these into the potential equation:\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))^2`\nSince `x = r cos(θ)`, the equation becomes:\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2`\nCombining the terms with `x^2`:\n`V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\nThis potential can be separated into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction.\n`V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`\nWhere:\n`V_x(x) = 2kx^2`\n`V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`\n\nThe standard form for a 1D harmonic oscillator potential is `1/2 mω^2 x^2`. We can find the angular frequencies (ω) for the x and y oscillators by comparing their potentials to the standard form.\nFor the x-oscillator:\n`1/2 mω_x^2 x^2 = 2kx^2`\n`mω_x^2 = 4k`\n`ω_x^2 = 4k/m`\n`ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nFor the y-oscillator:\n`1/2 mω_y^2 y^2 = 1/2 ky^2`\n`mω_y^2 = k`\n`ω_y^2 = k/m`\n`ω_y = sqrt(k/m)`\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are given by `E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω`. The total energy of the 2D system is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators.\n`E = E_x + E_y`\n`E = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for ω_x and ω_y:\n`E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nFactor out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k/m)`:\n`E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nComparing this result to the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
