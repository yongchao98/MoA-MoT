    "The calculation of Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory often involves integrals over undetermined loop momenta. A key technique for handling the divergences that appear in these integrals is dimensional regularization, where the calculation is performed in a general `d` number of spacetime dimensions.\n\nIn this method, each loop in a Feynman diagram introduces a momentum-space integral of the form `∫ d^d k / (2π)^d`. After performing mathematical operations such as a Wick rotation and integrating over the angular components in `d` dimensions, each loop integral contributes a characteristic factor of `1 / (4π)^(d/2)` to the final expression.\n\nThe problem is set in a four-dimensional spacetime, so we take `d=4`. Substituting this into the general formula, we find that each loop contributes a factor of `1 / (4π)^(4/2) = 1 / (4π)^2`.\n\nFor a diagram with `L` loops, this factor becomes `(1 / (4π)^2)^L`, which simplifies to `1 / (4π)^(2L)`.\n\nThe expression found on your colleague's note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nWe can see the term `1/(4pi)^6` in this expression. By comparing this to the general formula for an `L`-loop diagram, we can set up the following equation:\n\n`1 / (4π)^(2L) = 1 / (4π)^6`\n\nThis implies that `2L = 6`.\n\nSolving for `L`, the number of loops, we get:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other terms in the expression, such as the coupling constants (`alpha^3`, `g^2`), numerical factors (`sqrt(2)`, `8`), and the ratio of energy scales (`(Q/M)^2`), relate to the specific particles, interactions, and kinematics of the theory, but the power of the `(4π)` factor is a direct consequence of the number of loops in the diagram. Therefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<A>>>"
