    "To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product, we must first identify the structure of the final product (4) by analyzing the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step-by-step reaction analysis:**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid with Bromine, Pyridine, and Acetic Anhydride:** This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which brominates the alpha-carbon of the carboxylic acid.\n    *   Reactant: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH)\n    *   Product 1: α-Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH)\n\n2.  **Product 1 with Ethanol and Sulfuric Acid:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester using an alcohol and an acid catalyst.\n    *   Reactant: Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH) and ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH)\n    *   Product 2: Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n3.  **Product 2 with Sodium Cyanide:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction, where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide leaving group.\n    *   Reactant: Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)\n    *   Product 3: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n4.  **Product 3 with Excess Sodium Hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane:** This is a cyclic alkylation reaction.\n    *   First, the strong base sodium hydride (NaH) deprotonates the acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ group between the cyano and carbonyl groups) of ethyl cyanoacetate to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br), displacing one bromine atom.\n    *   Since excess NaH is used, a second deprotonation occurs at the α-carbon.\n    *   The resulting carbanion then performs an intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   Final Product 4: 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n\n**¹H NMR Analysis of Final Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane):**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct proton signals, we must examine the chemical equivalence of the hydrogens in the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to rapid chair-flipping at room temperature, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n*   **Ethoxycarbonyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH₂) are equivalent to each other but distinct from the methyl protons. This gives **1 signal**.\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** The presence of the quaternary substituted carbon (C1) makes the two protons on each of the other methylene groups (CH₂) in the ring diastereotopic. This means that even on the same carbon, the \"axial\" and \"equatorial\" type protons are chemically non-equivalent and will produce separate signals.\n    *   **C2 and C6:** These two positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. This results in two distinct signals for the four protons at these positions. **2 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, these positions are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct signals for the four protons at these positions. **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic. They lie in different chemical environments relative to the substituents on C1 and are not interchangeable by the plane of symmetry. This results in two distinct signals. **2 signals**.\n\n**Tally of Signals:**\n*   Ethyl group: 2 signals\n*   Ring protons (C2/C6, C3/C5, C4): 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals\n\nTotal distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8.\n\n<<<A>>>"
