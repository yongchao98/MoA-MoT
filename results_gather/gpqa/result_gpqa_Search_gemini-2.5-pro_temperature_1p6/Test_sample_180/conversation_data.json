    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain suddenly stopped. The pp-III branch is the sequence of reactions that produces high-energy neutrinos from the decay of Boron-8 (⁸B). Therefore, in this hypothetical scenario, the flux of ⁸B neutrinos becomes zero. All other reactions, including the other pp-chain branches and the CNO cycle, are assumed to continue at their normal rates.\n\n### 2. Identifying Neutrino Sources in the Energy Bands\n\nWe need to find the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands:\n*   **Band 1:** 700–800 keV (0.7–0.8 MeV)\n*   **Band 2:** 800–900 keV (0.8–0.9 MeV)\n\nLet's identify which solar neutrino sources contribute to these bands under the given hypothesis (i.e., with no ⁸B neutrinos):\n\n*   **pp neutrinos:** Their maximum energy is 420 keV, so they do not contribute to either band.\n*   **⁸B neutrinos:** Their flux is set to zero by the problem's premise.\n*   **pep neutrinos:** These are mono-energetic with an energy of 1.44 MeV, falling outside both bands.\n*   **CNO neutrinos:** Neutrinos from the CNO cycle (specifically from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays) have continuous energy spectra that extend up to ~1.7 MeV. They contribute to both Band 1 and Band 2.\n*   **⁷Be neutrinos:** This source is crucial. The pp-II branch, which is still active, produces mono-energetic neutrinos. The most prominent line is at 862 keV. This line falls squarely within Band 2 (800–900 keV).\n\nTherefore:\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV)** comes exclusively from CNO cycle neutrinos.\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV)** comes from the very strong ⁷Be neutrino line at 862 keV, plus a smaller contribution from CNO neutrinos.\n\n### 3. Estimating the Fluxes\n\nTo find the ratio, we must compare the magnitude of the CNO neutrino flux in Band 1 to the ⁷Be neutrino flux in Band 2.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2:** This is overwhelmingly dominated by the ⁷Be line. The total flux of these neutrinos has been measured and is predicted by the Standard Solar Model. According to the B16-GS98 solar model, the total flux of ⁷Be neutrinos is approximately **4.9 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second**. Since the entire line is within Band 2, this value represents the flux in Band 2, as the CNO contribution is comparatively negligible.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1:** This flux is the integral of the CNO neutrino energy spectrum over the 100 keV width of the band. From plots of the standard solar neutrino spectrum, the differential flux (dΦ/dE) from CNO neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range is estimated to be between 3 x 10⁸ and 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos per cm² per second per MeV.\n    To get the flux in the 100 keV (or 0.1 MeV) band, we multiply the differential flux by the band's width:\n    Flux(Band 1) ≈ (3 to 5 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹MeV⁻¹) * 0.1 MeV ≈ **3 to 5 x 10⁷ cm⁻²s⁻¹**.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio of the fluxes:\n\nRatio = Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2)\n\nUsing the higher estimate for the CNO flux to be conservative:\nRatio ≈ (5 x 10⁷ cm⁻²s⁻¹) / (4.9 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹)\n\nRatio ≈ 5 / 490 ≈ 1 / 98 ≈ 0.0102\n\nThis value is extremely close to 0.01.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe flux in the 800-900 keV band is dominated by the strong mono-energetic line of ⁷Be neutrinos from the pp-II chain. The flux in the 700-800 keV band consists only of the continuous spectrum from CNO neutrinos. The total flux from the ⁷Be line is about two orders of magnitude larger than the CNO flux integrated over the 100 keV of Band 1. This results in a ratio of approximately 0.01.\n\n<<<A>>>"
