    "All the statements provided concern the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2. After a thorough review of the scientific literature, the incorrect statement has been identified.\n\n**A) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While it is true that nsp10 and the N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 form an active heterodimeric exonuclease complex involved in a proofreading mismatch repair mechanism, its function is not to *prevent* the breakdown of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). In fact, the nsp10/nsp14 complex has 3'-5' exoribonuclease activity that actively *degrades* or digests various RNA structures, including dsRNA, to remove misincorporated nucleotides. Its role is to break down RNA strands with errors, not to protect them from breakdown.\n\n**B) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.**\nThis statement is correct. Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting is a key process in SARS-CoV-2 that occurs near the 5' end of the genome, allowing the translation of two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) into two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). [6, 8, 14] This process involves the ribosome slipping back by one nucleotide (a -1 shift) at a \"slippery site\" and is stimulated by a downstream RNA secondary structure called a pseudoknot. [1, 3, 4] Structural and functional studies have confirmed that the frameshifting signal, including the pseudoknot structure, is highly conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, showing a nearly identical conformation and promoting similar rates of frameshifting. [3, 13]\n\n**C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.**\nThis statement is correct. Studies have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein induces apoptosis by activating caspase-8, a hallmark of the extrinsic pathway. [8, 10] This activation occurs without altering the levels of Bcl-2, a key protein in the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. [1, 8, 10] Although the activated caspase-8 can subsequently cleave Bid, linking the extrinsic to the intrinsic pathway, the initial induction mechanism by ORF3a is correctly identified as being via the extrinsic pathway. [1, 4, 8]\n\n**D) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.**\nThis statement is correct. Research has shown that the efficiency of programmed ribosomal frameshifting is not necessarily correlated with the mechanical stability of the RNA pseudoknot, but rather shows a linear correlation with its conformational plasticity—the number of different conformations it can adopt. [4, 7] Using optical tweezers, studies have observed that the frameshift signals of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 adopt two distinct conformations under mechanical tension, which is consistent with their known frameshifting efficiencies.
