    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels changes.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe problem requires comparing the population of two atomic energy levels under different temperature conditions. The star's photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe the ratio of atoms in different energy states.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in a higher energy state (level 2) to a lower energy state (level 1):\n\n*N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT)*\n\nWhere:\n*   *N₂* and *N₁* are the number of atoms in level 2 and level 1.\n*   *g₂* and *g₁* are the statistical weights of the levels (which are constant for a given transition).\n*   *ΔE* is the energy difference between the two levels (*E₂ - E₁*).\n*   *k* is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   *T* is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Identify the Temperatures for Comparison**\n\nWe are given two scenarios for the star:\n*   **Unspotted Star:** The effective temperature (*T_unspotted*) is 6000 K.\n*   **Spotted Star:** When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the *overall* effective temperature (*T_spotted*) decreases to 5500 K.\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. The most direct interpretation, which aligns with the provided options, is to compare the population ratio for a uniform star at 6000 K to that of a uniform star at 5500 K.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy of a photon corresponding to the transition between the two levels can be calculated from its wavelength (λ). The relationship is:\n\n*ΔE = hc / λ*\n\nWhere:\n*   *h* is Planck's constant.\n*   *c* is the speed of light.\n*   *λ* is the wavelength, given as 1448 Å.\n\nTo simplify calculations, it's convenient to use units of electronvolts (eV) for energy. A useful constant product is *hc* ≈ 12400 eV·Å.\n\n*   ΔE = 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n**4. Determine the Factor of Change**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio of the population ratios at the two temperatures:\n\n*Factor = Ratio_unspotted / Ratio_spotted*\n*Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT_unspotted) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT_spotted) ]*\n\nThe statistical weight term (g₂/g₁) cancels out, leaving:\n\n*Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted) ]*\n*Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ]*\n\nNow, we can plug in the known values:\n*   *ΔE* ≈ 8.5635 eV\n*   *T_unspotted* = 6000 K\n*   *T_spotted* = 5500 K\n*   Boltzmann constant, *k* ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n\nFirst, calculate the term ΔE/k:\n*   ΔE/k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K\n\nNext, calculate the difference in the inverse temperatures:\n*   (1/5500 K) - (1/6000 K) ≈ (0.00018182 - 0.00016667) K⁻¹ ≈ 0.00001515 K⁻¹\n\nFinally, calculate the exponent and the factor:\n*   Exponent = 99379 K * 0.00001515 K⁻¹ ≈ 1.5056\n*   Factor = exp(1.5056) ≈ 4.507\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 2 to level 1 is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star's effective temperature is 6000 K compared to when it is 5500 K.\n\n<<<D>>>"
