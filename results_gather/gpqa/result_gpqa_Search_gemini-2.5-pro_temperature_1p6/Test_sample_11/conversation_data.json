    "The problem asks for the kinetic energies of the muon (μ+) and the neutrino (ν) resulting from the decay of a stationary positive pion (π+). The rest masses are given as m_π+ = 139.6 MeV/c² and m_μ+ = 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino is assumed to be massless. This is a classic two-body decay problem, which can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest energy. After the decay, this energy is distributed between the rest mass energy and kinetic energy of the products.\n    *   Initial Energy (E_initial) = Rest Energy of Pion = m_π+ * c² = 139.6 MeV\n    *   Final Energy (E_final) = (Rest Energy of Muon + Kinetic Energy of Muon) + (Kinetic Energy of Neutrino)\n    *   E_final = (m_μ+ * c² + KE_μ) + KE_ν\n    *   Equating initial and final energy: 139.6 MeV = (105.7 MeV + KE_μ) + KE_ν\n    *   This gives the total kinetic energy of the products: KE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: The pion is stationary, so the initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal-magnitude momenta.\n    *   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**: The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)².\n    *   For the neutrino (mass ≈ 0): E_ν² = (pc)², so E_ν = pc. Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its total energy is its kinetic energy (E_ν = KE_ν). Therefore, KE_ν = pc.\n    *   For the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μ * c²)². We also know that the muon's total energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy, E_μ = m_μ * c² + KE_μ.\n\n4.  **Solving for the Kinetic Energies**:\n    *   We can now set up an equation system. From conservation of energy, we have the total energy of the neutrino: KE_ν = E_ν = 139.6 MeV - E_μ.\n    *   Since pc = E_ν, we can substitute this into the muon's energy-momentum equation: E_μ² = (139.6 MeV - E_μ)² + (105.7 MeV)².\n    *   Expanding this equation: E_μ² = (139.6)² - 2*(139.6)*E_μ + E_μ² + (105.7)².\n    *   Simplifying and solving for E_μ: 0 = 19488.16 - 279.2*E_μ + 11172.49. This leads to E_μ = (19488.16 + 11172.49) / 279.2 ≈ 109.8 MeV.\n    *   The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy: KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ * c² = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.1 MeV.\n    *   The kinetic energy of the neutrino is the remaining energy: KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - E_μ = 139.6 MeV - 109.8 MeV = 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These values are very close to 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
