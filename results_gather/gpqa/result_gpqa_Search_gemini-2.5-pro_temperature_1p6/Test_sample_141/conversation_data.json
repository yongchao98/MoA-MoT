    "Any density matrix of a single qubit can be written in the form:\n\nρ = ½ (I + **r** ⋅ **σ**)\n\nWhere:\n*   **I** is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n*   **r** = (r_x, r_y, r_z) is the Bloch vector, which represents the geometrical position of the state in the Bloch sphere.\n*   **σ** = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\nThe given density matrix is:\n\nρ = ½ (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)\n\nIn matrix form, the basis states are |0⟩ =ᵀ and |1⟩ =ᵀ.\nTherefore:\n*   |0⟩⟨0| = [,]\n*   |1⟩⟨1| = [,]\n\nAdding them together gives the identity matrix:\n|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| = [,] = **I**\n\nSo, the density matrix is:\nρ = ½ **I**\n\nComparing this with the general form ρ = ½ (I + **r** ⋅ **σ**), we can see that:\n½ **I** = ½ (I + **r** ⋅ **σ**)\n**I** = **I** + **r** ⋅ **σ**\n**r** ⋅ **σ** = 0\n\nThis implies that the vector **r** must be the zero vector, **r** = (0, 0, 0).\n\nThis state is known as the maximally mixed state, and its geometrical position is at the origin or center of the Bloch sphere. Pure states are located on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are in the interior.\n\n<<<B>>>"
