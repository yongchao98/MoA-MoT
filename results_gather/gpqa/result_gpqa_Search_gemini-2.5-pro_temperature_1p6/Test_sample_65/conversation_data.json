    "When constructing the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), certain fundamental symmetries are assumed to be preserved. These form the basis upon which the theory is built.\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry:** SMEFT is constructed as a quantum field theory that is, by definition, consistent with special relativity. Therefore, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (invariance under boosts and rotations) and the broader Poincare symmetry, which also includes spacetime translations. The SMEFT Lagrangian consists of a series of local, higher-dimensional operators built from Standard Model fields that obey these spacetime symmetries.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** CPT (Charge, Parity, Time) symmetry is a fundamental consequence of any local, unitary, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. Since SMEFT is constructed with these properties, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n*   **CP Symmetry:** In contrast, CP (Charge, Parity) symmetry is not a required symmetry in SMEFT. The Standard Model itself contains a source of CP violation in the quark sector. A primary motivation for SMEFT is to parameterize all possible new physics effects, including potential new sources of CP violation that could be discovered in experiments. Therefore, the framework explicitly allows for CP-violating operators.\n\nBased on this, the symmetries that *must* be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
