    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the velocity of particle A.\n\n**1. Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this annihilation process is the conservation of energy. The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision. We must also conserve momentum.\n\n**2. Initial State**\n\n*   The process begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which is a common way in physics problems to imply that its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume the annihilation happens with the particles essentially at rest.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.3 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n*   $E_i = E_{p} + E_{\\bar{p}} = m_{p}c^{2} + m_{\\bar{p}}c^{2}$\n*   $E_i = 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Final State**\n\n*   The annihilation produces four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   We are given that the rest mass-energy of each particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   The initial energy is converted into the rest energy and kinetic energy of these four particles.\n*   By conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum was zero, the four final particles must move off in such a way that their total vector momentum is also zero. Due to the symmetry of the products (all have the same mass), the energy will be distributed equally among them.\n*   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles. The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   $E_f = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n*   $E_f = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\n*   Equating the initial and final energies:\n    $E_i = E_f$\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   Now, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n*   The Lorentz factor is related to velocity ($v$) by the equation:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\n*   To find the velocity, we rearrange the formula:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}$\n    $\\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n*   Now, substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n    $v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n    $v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n    $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n    $v = c \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    $v \\approx 0.7688c$\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>"
