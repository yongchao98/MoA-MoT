    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in their individual energies. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as it applies to energy and time. The uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state is related to its lifetime. A state with a finite lifetime has an inherent uncertainty in its energy.\n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle is given by the relation ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For practical purposes, we can approximate this as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime of the state.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each of the two quantum states:\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime (τ1) = 10⁻⁹ seconds\n*   The reduced Planck's constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE1) ≈ ħ / τ1\n*   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n*   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime (τ2) = 10⁻⁸ seconds\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE2) ≈ ħ / τ2\n*   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n*   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (the total linewidth).\n\nTotal energy uncertainty (ΔE_total) ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2\nΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\nΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\nΔE_total ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow, we compare this total uncertainty with the given options to find an energy difference that is clearly distinguishable:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than the total uncertainty.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is significantly larger than the total uncertainty of approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than the total uncertainty.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is also much smaller than the total uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to clearly resolve the two energy levels.\n\n<<<B>>>"
