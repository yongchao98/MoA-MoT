    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the term e^(-βE) over all possible states of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2^3 = 8 possible configurations.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 configurations:\n\n**Configuration 1:** All spins are up.\n*   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n*   E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n**Configuration 2:** All spins are down.\n*   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n*   E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThese two states are degenerate, meaning they have the same energy level. The degeneracy (number of states) for E = -3J is g₁ = 2.\n\n**Configuration 3:** Two spins are up, one is down. There are three such possibilities:\n*   (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n*   (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n*   (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n\n**Configuration 4:** One spin is up, two are down. There are also three such possibilities:\n*   (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n*   (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n*   (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n\nAll six of these states are degenerate with an energy of E = J. The degeneracy for this energy level is g₂ = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states:\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\nwhere gᵢ is the degeneracy of the energy level Eᵢ.\n\nSubstituting the energy values and their degeneracies we found:\nZ = (g₁ * e^(-βE₁)) + (g₂ * e^(-βE₂))\nZ = (2 * e^(-β(-3J))) + (6 * e^(-β(J)))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\nC) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\nD) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
