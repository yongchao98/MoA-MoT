    "To determine the value of \"a,\" we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle anywhere in the space it can exist must be equal to 1. The probability is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|².\n\nThe given wave function is a complex function:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe squared magnitude of this wave function is:\n|Ψ(x)|² = [Re(Ψ)]² + [Im(Ψ)]²\n|Ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + [-0.5]²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nSince the particles are only found in the interval between x=1 and x=3, we must integrate the probability density over this interval and set it equal to 1.\n\n∫₁³ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n∫₁³ [a² / (1 + x) + 0.25] dx = 1\n\nWe can solve this integral analytically:\n∫ [a² / (1 + x) + 0.25] dx = a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x\n\nNow, we evaluate this result over the definite interval from 1 to 3:\n[a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3] - [a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1]\n= [a² * ln(4) + 0.75] - [a² * ln(2) + 0.25]\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B), the expression simplifies to:\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\nSetting this result equal to 1, as per the normalization condition:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ √0.7214\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
