    "Here is a selection of the major products for the given rearrangements:\n\n**Reaction A: (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene + (1. BuLi, 2. H+) → A**\n\nThis reaction is a-Wittig rearrangement. The strong base, butyllithium (BuLi), deprotonates the starting material, benzyl prenyl ether, at the most acidic position, which is the carbon atom adjacent to both the phenyl ring and the ether oxygen (the benzylic position). The resulting carbanion undergoes a rapid, concerted-sigmatropic rearrangement, which is generally favored over the competing-Wittig rearrangement at low temperatures. The subsequent addition of an acid (H+) protonates the newly formed alkoxide to yield the final alcohol product. The major product, A, is **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**.\n\n**Reaction B: 3,4,5,7,8,9-hexamethyl-1,11-dimethylene-2,6,10,11,11a,11b-hexahydro-1H-benzo[cd]indeno[7,1-gh]azulene + Heat → B**\n\nThis reaction is a thermal isomerization of a complex polycyclic hydrocarbon. The application of heat initiates a cascade of pericyclic reactions, specifically Cope rearrangements. Since this is a rearrangement, the molecular formula of the product must be the same as the starting material. The starting compound has a formula of C30H32. The product options differ in their degree of saturation (\"hexahydro\" vs. \"tetrahydro\"). The \"hexahydro\" product is consistent with an isomerization reaction, retaining the C30H32 molecular formula. In contrast, a \"tetrahydro\" product would imply the loss of two hydrogen atoms, which is characteristic of an oxidation or pyrolysis reaction, not a simple thermal rearrangement. Therefore, product B is **2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro-1H-benzoazuleno[1,8,7,6-cdef]fluorene**.\n\nBased on the identification of both products, the correct option is:\n\n**B) A = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol, B = 2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro-1H-benzoazuleno[1,8,7,6-cdef]fluorene**\n\n<<<B>>>"
