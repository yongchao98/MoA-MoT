    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the molecular weight range for substance A4.\n\n**1. Identifying Element Y**\n\nThe prompt states that A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (Number of F atoms * Molar Mass of F) / (Molar Mass of Y + Number of F atoms * Molar Mass of F)\n\nLet M(Y) be the molar mass of element Y and M(F) be the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol). Let 'n' be the number of fluorine atoms in A2.\n\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * n = 19.00 * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe need to find an integer 'n' that corresponds to a plausible element Y, which is known to form at least five binary fluorides. Let's test integer values for 'n':\n*   n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Near Argon/Potassium/Calcium - unlikely)\n*   n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Near Bromine/Selenium - unlikely to form 5 fluorides)\n*   n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Near Antimony - forms only two stable fluorides)\n*   n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (In the lanthanide series)\n*   n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Near Mercury/Thallium)\n*   n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (This is very close to the molar mass of Plutonium, Pu, which is ~244 g/mol)\n\nLet's assume Y is **Plutonium (Pu)** and n=6. Let's recalculate the fluorine percentage for PuF6:\nM(PuF6) = 244 + (6 * 19) = 244 + 114 = 358 g/mol\nɷF(PuF6) = (114 / 358) * 100% ≈ 31.84%\nThis is very close to the given 31.96%, so it's a strong indication that **Y is Plutonium (Pu)** and **A2 is PuF6**.\n\n**2. Identifying the Five Fluorine Compounds**\n\nPlutonium is known to form several binary fluorides. The most common are PuF3, PuF4, and PuF6. Plutonium pentafluoride (PuF5) is also known. This gives us four compounds. The problem implies the existence of a fifth, A1, which is unstable.\n\nLet's analyze the remaining clues:\n*   **A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (PuF6) and fluorine.** Plutonium hexafluoride (PuF6) itself is described as a red-brown volatile solid. It is also the highest known fluoride of plutonium. However, the problem describes A1 decomposing *into* PuF6, suggesting A1 is a higher, less stable fluoride or an excited state that releases fluorine. The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" is very similar to the \"red-brown\" color of PuF6. Given that PuF6 is the highest known fluoride, A1 is likely an unstable plutonium fluoride that readily decomposes to the more stable PuF6. PuF6 is known to decompose, especially under irradiation, potentially to PuF5 and fluorine. However, the prompt says A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, so A1 -> PuF6 + F2. This compound is not explicitly named in the search results, but the logic points to a very unstable higher fluoride. Let's accept A2 as PuF6 based on the mass percentage.\n*   **A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.** PuF6 is an extremely powerful oxidizing agent. This property fits.\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Pu) with fluorine.** Both PuF4 and PuF6 are produced by fluorinating plutonium.\n*   **A3 can also interact with xenon.** This confirms A3 is also a strong fluorinating/oxidizing agent. PuF6 fits this description. So, let's tentatively assign **A3 = PuF6**. This would mean A2 and A3 are the same compound, which is plausible.\n*   **By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.** We are left with PuF3, PuF4, and PuF5 as possibilities for A4 and A5. This reaction is Pu + A4 -> A5. This looks like a reduction of a higher plutonium fluoride by plutonium metal. A possible reaction is the reduction of PuF4 by Pu to form PuF3. Let's test this hypothesis:\n    *   3 PuF4 + Pu → 4 PuF3\n    *   This is not a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    Let's consider another possibility. A reaction to form an intermediate fluoride:\n    *   Pu + PuF5 -> ? This is less documented.\n    *   Pu + PuF4 -> ? Formation of compounds with mixed valence states is complex.\n    Let's re-examine the known fluorides: PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6.\n    The reduction of PuF4 by Pu metal is a known process in plutonium metallurgy. The reaction `3 PuF4 + Pu → 4 PuF3` shows that adding Pu to PuF4 does produce another fluoride. While not a 1:1 ratio, chemical problem statements can sometimes simplify complex stoichiometry. Let's re-evaluate the clues. Maybe the reaction is simpler. Let's tentatively set **A4 = PuF4** and **A5 = PuF3**.\n\n**3. Verifying the Compounds**\n\n*   A1: Unstable, red, decomposes to PuF6.\n*   A2: **PuF6** (ɷF ≈ 31.84%).\n*   A3: **PuF6** (reacts with Xe, made by fluorinating Pu).\n*   A4: **PuF4**.\n*   A5: **PuF3**.\n\n**4. Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on our deductions, A4 is plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4).\n*   Molar Mass of Plutonium (Pu) ≈ 244 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19 g/mol\n\nMolecular Weight of PuF4 = M(Pu) + 4 * M(F)\nMolecular Weight of PuF4 = 244 + 4 * 19\nMolecular Weight of PuF4 = 244 + 76\nMolecular Weight of PuF4 = 320 g/mol\n\nThis result (320 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges (A, B, C, D). Let me re-read the problem carefully. \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained\". This suggests that A4 is dissolved in a solvent. What if A4 is not a plutonium compound, but a compound of another element that reacts with Pu? The problem states \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known\". This strongly implies A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 are all plutonium fluorides.\n\nLet's reconsider the elements. Could Y be another element? Let's go back to M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\nWhat if n=4? M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This could be Dysprosium (Dy, 162.5). DyF3 is its most common fluoride. DyF4 exists. It's not known for forming five fluorides or oxidizing xenon.\n\nLet's stick with Plutonium. There must be an error in my identification of A4.\nA1: Higher fluoride\nA2: PuF6\nA3: PuF6\nA4: ?\nA5: ?\n\nReaction: Pu + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio)\nKnown fluorides: PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6.\nMaybe the reaction involves PuF5?\nPu + PuF5 -> ? This is not a standard reaction.\n\nLet's rethink A2. ɷF = 31.96%.\nLet's recalculate M(Y) = (19n * (1-0.3196)) / 0.3196 = (12.9276n) / 0.3196 = 40.4493n\nLet's use a more precise mass for F = 18.9984.\nM(Y) = (18.9984n * (1-0.3196)) / 0.3196 = (12.9265n) / 0.3196 = 40.445n.\nIf n=6, M(Y) = 242.67. This is extremely close to the isotope Pu-242.\n\nThe key must be in the reaction: `Y + A4 -> A5` (1:1 ratio).\nLet's consider the oxidation states of Pu: +3, +4, +5, +6 in its fluorides.\nY is Pu(0). A4 and A5 are fluorides.\nPu(0) + PuF(x) -> PuF(y)\nThis is a comproportionation reaction.\nExample: Pu(0) + 2 PuF3 -> 3 PuF2 (Not a 1:1 ratio, and PuF2 is not a standard compound)\nExample: Pu(0) + 3 PuF4 -> 4 PuF3 (Not a 1:1 ratio)\n\nWhat if the problem comes from a context where other, less common fluorides are considered? The question is highly specific.\n\nLet's reconsider A1 decomposing into A2. `A1 -> A2 + F2`. This means A1 has a higher F:Y ratio than A2. If A2 is PuF6, then A1 might be something like PuF7 or PuF8, which are hypothetical but would be extremely strong oxidizers, fitting the description of oxidizing xenon.\n\nLet's go back to the mass percentage calculation. What if the element isn't Pu?\nIf n=5, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * 5 = 202.25. This is close to Mercury (Hg, 200.6) or Bismuth (Bi, 209). Bismuth forms BiF3 and BiF5. Not five.\nIf n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35. Close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8). SbF3, SbF5. Not five.\n\nLet's assume Y is Krypton (Kr). M=83.8.\nn=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9.\nIf A2 = KrF2. M(KrF2) = 83.8 + 2*19 = 121.8.\nɷF = 38 / 121.8 = 31.2%. This is close.\nDoes Kr form 5 fluorides? No, only KrF2 and some unstable polyfluorides. KrF2 reacts with Xe. But it decomposes at room temperature, while A2 (from A1 -> A2 + F2) seems to be the more stable product. A1 would have to be KrF4 which decomposes to KrF2. KrF4 is extremely unstable. This path seems less likely.\n\nPlutonium seems to be the correct element Y. Let me reassess the fluorides A1-A5.\n*   Y = Pu\n*   Five binary compounds: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5. We know of PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6. So one of these must be A1.\n*   A1 is bright-red, decomposes at 293 K. A2 has ɷF=31,96%.\n*   A1 oxidizes Xe.\nThis description strongly points towards **PuF6** being A1. It is reddish-brown, unstable (decomposes via auto-radiolysis at a rate of 1.5%/day at room temp), and a powerful oxidizer.\nSo, if **A1 = PuF6**.\nThe decomposition is `A1 -> A2 + F2`. This means `PuF6 -> PuF4 + F2`.\nLet's check the fluorine content of A2=PuF4.\nM(PuF4) = 244 + 4*19 = 320.\nɷF = (4*19)/320 = 76/320 = 23.75%. This is not 31.96%.\n\nThere is a contradiction. Let's revisit the initial calculation. M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n gives Pu for n=6. The compound with 6 fluorine atoms is PuF6. So **A2 = PuF6**.\nNow, let's re-read clue 2: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine\".\nThis means A1 -> A2 + F2.\nIf A2=PuF6, A1 would have to be something like PuF8, which is not known.\n\nPerhaps there's another interpretation. What if \"decomposition\" doesn't involve breaking a Pu-F bond, but a change of state or structure? Or what if A1 is an adduct? But the problem says \"binary compounds\".\n\nLet's trust the calculation: Y=Pu, A2=PuF6.\nAnd trust the decomposition reaction type: A1 -> A2 + F2.\nThis implies the existence of a higher fluoride than PuF6, let's call it PuFx (x>6), which will be A1. Even if not formally isolated and characterized, its existence is implied by the problem. It would be bright red and extremely unstable (decomposing at 20°C). As an ultra-strong fluorinating agent, it would certainly oxidize xenon. This is plausible in the context of a challenging chemistry problem.\n\nSo:\nY = **Pu**\nA1 = **PuFx (x>6)**, unstable higher fluoride.\nA2 = **PuF6** (ɷF~31.84%)\nA3 = can interact with Xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. PuF6 is obtained by fluorination of Pu and is a strong oxidizer. So, **A3 = PuF6**.\nNow we have three fluorides left to assign: PuF3, PuF4, PuF5. They must be A4 and A5. The prompt only refers to five compounds. A1, A2(=A3), A4, A5... and one more. Or A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 are all different. If A2=A3, then there is one more compound, let's call it A6.\n\nLet's list the knowns again: PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6, PuFx (A1). This is our set of five.\nA2 = PuF6.\nA3 = PuF6. So A2=A3.\n\nNow the final clues:\n*   \"By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" `Pu + A4 -> A5`\n*   \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n\nThe reaction is a comproportionation. Pu(0) + Pu(X+) -> Pu(Y+).\nLet's try the possibilities with the remaining fluorides: PuF3, PuF4, PuF5.\nReaction: `Pu(0) + PuF5 -> A5`. This is not a balanced, simple reaction.\nReaction: `Pu(0) + PuF4 -> A5`. This would result in `3 PuF4 + Pu -> 4 PuF3`. Not 1:1.\nWhat if A5 is an intermediate fluoride not on our list? Or what if the 1:1 ratio is a key?\n\nMaybe there's another element? Let's check **Rhenium (Re)**. M=186.2.\nRe forms ReF4, ReF5, ReF6, ReF7. That's four. Let's calculate mass percentages.\nA2 = ReF6. M(ReF6) = 186.2 + 6*19 = 300.2. ɷF = (6*19)/300.2 = 114/300.2 = 37.9%. Not a match.\n\nLet's go back to Pu. The calculation is solid. The interpretation must be the tricky part.\n\nA1 -> A2(PuF6) + F2\nA3 = PuF6\nReaction: Pu + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio)\nA5 + H2O -> two substances\n\nLet's assume the question has a mistake and the reaction is `2PuF3 + Pu -> 3PuF2-like species` or `3PuF4 + Pu -> 4PuF3`. The latter is a very common reaction in plutonium processing. Let's ignore the 1:1 ratio for a moment and assume **A4 = PuF4** and **A5 = PuF3**.\n\nWhat is the molecular weight of **PuF5**?\nMW(PuF5) = 244 + 5*19 = 244 + 95 = **339 g/mol**.\nWhat is the molecular weight of **PuF4**?\nMW(PuF4) = 244 + 4*19 = 244 + 76 = **320 g/mol**.\nWhat is the molecular weight of **PuF3**?\nMW(PuF3) = 244 + 3*19 = 244 + 57 = **301 g/mol**.\n\nNone of these fall in the ranges given. There must be something fundamentally wrong in my interpretation.\n\nLet's rethink \"binary compounds of fluorine with element Y\". It doesn't mean YF_n. It could be Yx_Fy. Let's reconsider the mass percent calculation:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (x * M(Y) + n * M(F)) = 0.3196.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's revisit the prompt. Maybe Y is not a single element. But \"element Y\" suggests it is.\nMaybe the molar mass of Y is different? Let's assume one of the options is correct and work backwards.\n\nIf A) is correct, MW of A4 is 160-180.\nA4 = YFx. Let's assume common valencies. If x=3, YF3 is 160-180. M(Y) = 160-57 to 180-57 = 103 to 123. (Rhodium, Tin, Antimony, Tellurium, Iodine). None are known for five fluorides.\nIf x=4, YF4 is 160-180. M(Y) = 160-76 to 180-76 = 84 to 104. (Kr, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh). Krypton is a possibility. KrF4 has a MW of 83.8 + 76 = 159.8. This is in the range!\n\nLet's test **Y = Krypton (Kr)**.\n1.  **Five binary compounds:** KrF2, KrF4. Only two are well-established. This is a weak point.\n2.  **A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine.**\n    Let A1 = KrF4. It is very unstable. `KrF4 -> KrF2 + F2`. So A2 = KrF2.\n    Let's check the mass percent of F in KrF2. M(Kr)=83.8. M(KrF2) = 83.8 + 2*19 = 121.8.\n    ɷF = (2*19)/121.8 = 38/121.8 = 31.2%. This is very close to 31.96%. Let's assume this is correct.\n3.  **A1 (KrF4) oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.** Yes, KrF4 is a much stronger oxidizer than XeF4.\n4.  **A3 can also interact with xenon.** Let's say A3=KrF2. Yes, it can fluorinate Xe to XeF2.\n5.  **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.** Kr + F2 -> KrF2. This is correct.\n6.  **By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.** `Kr + A4 -> A5`. This implies A4 is a krypton fluoride, but there aren't any others. The clue says \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". This sounds like a compound dissolved in a solvent, not a gaseous fluoride.\n\nThis trail also leads to a contradiction. The problem seems to be designed around a very specific, possibly obscure, set of reactions. Let's reconsider the Plutonium path.\n\nA1 -> A2 + F2; A2 has ~32% F. --> Y=Pu, A2=PuF6.\nThis seems the most solid starting point. What if the description of PuF6 is slightly different in the source material of this question? It is reddish, it does decompose, it is the product of fluorination, it oxidizes Xenon.\n\nLet's focus on the last two clues again, assuming Y=Pu.\n`Pu + A4 -> A5` (1:1 mole ratio)\nA5 decomposes in water.\n\nWe have PuF3, PuF4, PuF5 remaining. A4 and A5 must be two of these.\nAqueous chemistry of plutonium fluorides:\n*   PuF3 is very insoluble in water.\n*   PuF4 is insoluble in water. Hydrolyzes at high temperatures.\n*   PuF6 reacts vigorously with water: `PuF6 + 2 H2O → PuO2F2 + 4 HF`. This is decomposition into two substances. So, **A5 could be PuF6**.\n\nBut A2 and A3 were already identified as PuF6. A5 has to be different. The problem says \"Five binary compounds\".\nLet's list them: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5.\nIf A2=A3=PuF6, we need four other compounds. PuF3, PuF4, PuF5 and A1. This works.\nBut if A5 = PuF6, then we have A2=A3=A5=PuF6. That would mean there are only 3 distinct compounds (A1, PuF6, A4), which contradicts \"Five binary compounds\". So A5 cannot be PuF6.\n\nWhat about hydrolysis of the others?\nHydrolysis of PuF4 yields PuO2 and HF. `PuF4 + 2H2O -> PuO2 + 4HF`. Two substances.\nHydrolysis of PuF3 yields PuOOH or Pu2O3.\n\nLet's assume **A5 = PuF4**.\nThis fits the clue \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances\".\nIf A5 = PuF4, then the reaction is `Pu + A4 -> PuF4` (1:1 ratio).\nTo make Pu(IV)F4 from Pu(0), A4 must have an oxidation state higher than 4. The only candidate is **A4 = PuF5**.\nLet's check the reaction: `Pu + 4 PuF5 -> 5 PuF4`. This involves a 4:1 ratio of fluorides, not 1:1.\nAnother try: `Pu(0) + Pu(V)F5 -> ...` this doesn't balance easily to a single product in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's challenge the interpretation of the mass percent again.\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\nPerhaps there's a dimeric species? Y2Fn.\nM(Y) = (n*M(F)/0.3196 - n*M(F))/2\nIf n=10, in Y2F10 (i.e., (YF5)2), M(Y) would be ~202.\nBismuth, Bi, MW=209. Let Y=Bi. A2 = BiF5.\nM(BiF5) = 209 + 5*19 = 304.\nɷF(BiF5) = (5*19)/304 = 95/304 = 31.25%. This is close.\nDoes Bismuth have 5 binary fluorides? No, mainly BiF3 and BiF5. Does it oxidize Xe? BiF5 is a powerful oxidizer, but reaction with Xe is not commonly cited. This is a dead end.\n\nLet's return to the most likely candidate, Plutonium, and assume there is a subtlety I am missing. The most reliable data point is that A2 has 31.96% F, which points strongly to PuF6. Let's assume A2=PuF6 is correct.\n\nNow, we need to find A4.\nA1 -> PuF6 + F2\nA3 -> reacts with Xe (PuF6)\nPu + A4 -> A5 (1:1)\nA5 + H2O -> 2 products\n\nThe problem seems constructed, and may not reflect perfectly common lab reactions. Let's take the \"1:1 molar ratio\" literally.\nPu(0) + PuF(x) -> 2 PuF(y)?  Then 0+x = 2y. For example, Pu(0) + PuF4 -> 2 \"PuF2\". If \"PuF2\" exists, this could be A5. A4 would be PuF4. MW(A4=PuF4) = 320. Not in options.\nAnother try: Pu(0) + PuF6 -> 2 \"PuF3\". Then A4 = PuF6. But we assigned A2/A3 to PuF6. That would mean A4=A2=A3. Let's check MW(A4=PuF6) = 358. Not in options.\n\nLet's assume the question is about **Iodine (I)**. M(I)=126.9.\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n. -> 126.9 ≈ 40.45 * n -> n=3.13. So let's test IF3.\nɷF(IF3) = (3*19)/(126.9+57) = 57/183.9 = 30.99%. A bit low.\nLet's test IF5. ɷF(IF5) = (5*19)/(126.9+95) = 95/221.9 = 42.8%. Too high.\n\nThe plutonium calculation is too good to be a coincidence.\nA2=PuF6.\nMaybe A4 is a fluoride of a different element? No, \"binary compounds of fluorine with element Y\".\n\nLet's reconsider the decomposition. Maybe A1 decomposes differently.\nWhat if A1 is PuF5? White solid. What if A1 is Pu2F10?\nThe problem specifies \"bright-red substance\". PuF6 is \"red-brown\". Close enough.\n\nIs there any other possibility for A2 with 31.96% F?\nM(Y) = 12.9276*n / 0.3196. Let's assume M(F)=19.\nn=1 -> 40.4\nn=2 -> 80.9\nn=3 -> 121.3\nn=4 -> 161.8\nn=5 -> 202.2\nn=6 -> 242.7 (Pu)\nn=7 -> 283.1\nLet's check Tc (Technetium, M=98). `98/40.45 = 2.4`. No.\nLet's check Np (Neptunium, M=237). `237/40.45 = 5.85`. Close to n=6. NpF6 exists.\nɷF(NpF6) = (6*19)/(237+114) = 114/351 = 32.4%. This is also close. Does Np form 5 fluorides? NpF3, NpF4, NpF5, NpF6. It has 4.\n\nThe evidence for Plutonium is the strongest. The problem must have a logical path I am missing.\nA1 = PuFx (x>6)\nA2 = PuF6\nA3 = PuF6\nA4 = ?\nA5 = ? (Pu+A4 -> A5)\nOther known fluorides: PuF3, PuF4, PuF5.\n\nLet's review the problem statement again. \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nWhat if A4 is not a binary fluoride but is in solution? Maybe a complex? No, the prompt says \"Five **binary compounds**\".\nWhat if the solvent reacts? Unlikely for this type of problem.\n\nThe problem seems to revolve around the five specific fluorides of a single element Y. That element is almost certainly Plutonium. The issue is identifying A4 from the remaining fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF5) and the given reaction.\n`Pu + A4 -> A5` (1:1)\n`A5 decomposes in water`.\nLet's re-check the hydrolysis. `PuF4 + 2 H2O -> PuO2 + 4 HF`. Yes, two products. So A5 = PuF4 is a possibility.\nIf A5=PuF4, then `Pu + A4 -> PuF4`. For this to be 1:1, maybe it's `Pu + F + A4-F -> PuF4`? That makes no sense.\n\nLet's think about oxidation states. `Pu(0) + Pu(n+) -> Pu(m+)`\nCould the reaction be a complex formation? `Pu + PuF4 -> [Pu2F4]`?\nThe stoichiometry is 1:1. The product is A5. `A5 = [Pu2F4]`.\nIs this a known binary compound? No.\n\nLet's reconsider my very first idea: Y = Krypton (Kr). A2 = KrF2. ɷF=31.2% (close).\nA1=KrF4. A1->A2+F2 matches `KrF4 -> KrF2+F2`. A1 oxidizes Xe.\nFive binary compounds: This is the major issue. If the question source considers some unstable krypton polyfluorides, it might be the key. Let's assume there are 5 for a moment.\n`Y(Kr) + A4 -> A5` (1:1). In solution.\nA4 is a Kr fluoride. A4 would have to be KrF2 or KrF4. The solution part is odd. But let's assume A4=KrF2.\nKr + KrF2 -> no simple product.\nLet's go back to the molecular weight of A4=KrF4.\nM(KrF4) = 83.8 + 4*19 = 159.8 g/mol.\nThis falls squarely in range B) 140-160.\nLet's check the rest of the puzzle with this assumption.\nA1 = KrF4\nA2 = KrF2 (from decomposition)\nA3 = obtained by fluorination, reacts with Xe. KrF2 fits.\nA4 = A fluoride of Kr. Must be different from A1, A2, A3. This is where it breaks down, as there aren't other stable/known fluorides.\n\nUnless... A4 is not a krypton fluoride, but Xenon Hexafluoride? XeF6. It's a binary compound of fluorine. MW = 131.3 + 6*19 = 245.3.\nAnd Y is what?\nThis seems too convoluted. The simplest path is that A1-A5 are all fluorides of the same element Y.\n\nLet's take a leap of faith on the Krypton path. Let's say A4=KrF4.\nMW = 159.8 g/mol, which is in range B.\nThe main flaw is \"five binary compounds\" and what A5 would be.\nBut maybe the question is flawed, and the numerical match of KrF4's molar mass and KrF2's fluorine percentage is the intended solution.\nLet's re-calculate %F in KrF2 using more precise masses. Kr=83.798, F=18.9984.\nM(KrF2) = 83.798 + 2*18.9984 = 121.7948\n%F = (2*18.9984) / 121.7948 = 37.9968 / 121.7948 = 31.197%.\nThis is close to 31.96%, but the difference is ~0.8%.\nLet's re-calculate %F in PuF6. Pu=244.06, F=18.9984.\nM(PuF6) = 244.06 + 6*18.9984 = 358.05\n%F = (6*18.9984) / 358.05 = 113.99 / 358.05 = 31.836%.\nThis is extremely close to 31.96%. The difference is only ~0.12%.\n\nThe Plutonium identification is almost certainly correct.\nY=Pu, A2=PuF6.\nThe error must be in identifying A4.\n`Pu + A4 -> A5` (1:1 ratio)\nKnowns left: PuF3, PuF4, PuF5. A4 and A5 are two of them.\nWhat if A5 is PuF3? It's relatively stable in water compared to the others. The problem says \"decomposes with the formation of two substances\". This might contradict.\nWhat if A5 is PuF4? Hydrolyzes to PuO2 and HF. This fits. If A5=PuF4, then Pu + A4 -> PuF4. A4 must be PuF5. But the stoichiometry `Pu + 4 PuF5 -> 5 PuF4` is not 1:1.\n\nThere is a significant inconsistency in the problem statement's constraints. However, I must choose an answer. Let's revisit the molar masses and the options.\nA) 160-180\nB) 140-160 (contains KrF4=159.8)\nC) 220-240\nD) 110-130 (contains KrF2=121.8)\n\nIf Y=Kr, then A2=KrF2, which has a MW of 121.8. This fits range D. A4 is another fluoride, perhaps KrF4 (MW 159.8, range B). If A2=A4, then D would be the answer for the MW of A2. But the question asks for A4.\n\nLet's assume the question has an error and Y=Kr. If A2=KrF2, what are A4 and A5? The only other candidate for a binary compound is KrF4.\nSo {A4, A5} must be {KrF2, KrF4} in some order. But A2=KrF2 already. So this implies there are not five distinct compounds.\n\nLet's go back to Pu. The identification is solid.\nY = Pu.\nKnown distinct binary fluorides: PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6. And the hypothetical A1 (PuFx, x>6). Total of five.\nA2 = PuF6 (from %F calculation). MW=358.\nA1 -> PuF6 + F2. (A1 = PuFx).\nA3 oxidizes Xe -> probably PuF6.\nSo we have PuF3, PuF4, PuF5 left to be assigned to A4 and A5.\n`Pu + A4 -> A5`\n`A5 hydrolyzes to two products`. PuF4 hydrolyzes this way. Let's assume A5 = PuF4.\n`Pu + A4 -> PuF4`\nThis implies A4 has a higher oxidation state than +4. The only candidate is PuF5.\nSo, **A4 = PuF5**.\nNow, let's calculate the molecular weight of PuF5.\nM(PuF5) = M(Pu) + 5 * M(F) = 244 + 5 * 19 = 244 + 95 = **339 g/mol**.\nThis is not among the options.\n\nThe problem is unsolvable as stated due to contradictions. Let me check for an alternative element whose fluoride has 31.96% F.\nLet's try **Uranium (U)**. M=238. `238 / 40.45 = 5.88`. Close to n=6. UF6 exists.\n%F in UF6: (6*19) / (238+114) = 114 / 352 = 32.38%. Also close. U has UF3, UF4, U2F9, UF5, UF6. That's 5 compounds.\nLet's assume Y=U. A2 = UF6.\nA1 -> UF6 + F2. (A1 = UFx, x>6, unstable). A1 oxidizes Xe (UF6 does this, let alone a higher fluoride).\nA3 from fluorination of U. A3 reacts with Xe. -> A3 = UF6.\n`U + A4 -> A5`\n`A5 decomposes in water`.\nUranium fluorides left: UF3, UF4, U2F9, UF5.\nUF4 hydrolyzes to UO2 + 4HF. So maybe A5 = UF4.\nReaction: `U + A4 -> UF4`. A4 must be a higher fluoride.\nLet's test **A4 = UF5**. Reaction: `U + 3UF5 -> ?`. Doesn't balance well.\nLet's test **A4 = U2F9**. `U + U2F9 -> 3UF(9/3)=3UF3`? No.\nLet's test A4=UF6 again. `U + UF6 -> A5`. This is how UF5 and UF4 can be made.\n`U + UF6 -> U2F9`\n`U + 2UF5 -> 3UF4`\n`U + 3UF6 -> 4UF5` (approximately).\n\nThe problem seems designed around an element that forms at least five fluorides, with one having ~32% fluorine. U and Pu are the best candidates. But the subsequent reaction steps don't align with simple 1:1 stoichiometry while matching the given answer ranges.\n\nLet me try to work backwards from the answers again, but with U, Np, Pu.\nIf A4 has MW 160-180 (A).\nIf A4=YFx, MW(Y) is 103-123 (for x=3), or 84-104 (for x=4). Doesn't match U/Pu/Np.\nIf A4 has MW 140-160 (B).\nIf A4=YFx, MW(Y) is 83-103 (for x=3) or 64-84 (for x=4). Doesn't match. Kr(83.8) fits if x=4, giving KrF4=159.8.\nIf A4 has MW 220-240 (C).\nIf A4=YFx, MW(Y) is 163-183 (x=3) or 144-164 (x=4).\nIf Y=U/Np/Pu, let's check their fluorides' MWs.\nUF3 = 238+57 = 295\nUF4 = 238+76 = 314\nU2F9 = 2*238+9*19 = 476+171 = 647\nUF5 = 238+95 = 333\nUF6 = 238+114 = 352\n\nPuF3 = 244+57 = 301\nPuF4 = 244+76 = 320\nPuF5 = 244+95 = 339\nPuF6 = 244+114 = 358\n\nNone of the fluorides of U or Pu have a molecular weight that falls into any of the ranges A, B, C, D.\n\nThis implies one of three things:\n1.  Element Y is not an actinide.\n2.  A4 is not a simple binary fluoride YFx.\n3.  The question/options are flawed.\n\nLet's reconsider the Krypton path. Y=Kr.\nFlaw 1: Kr only has two well-known fluorides (KrF2, KrF4). The question requires five.\nFlaw 2: The %F in KrF2 (31.2%) is less accurate than in PuF6 (31.84%) when compared to 31.96%.\nBenefit 1: MW of KrF4 is 159.8, which fits option B perfectly.\nBenefit 2: MW of KrF2 is 121.8, which fits option D perfectly.\nIf the question is \"indicate the range in which the molecular weight of **substance A2** falls\", the answer would be D (110-130).\nIf the question is \"indicate the range in which the molecular weight of **substance A1** falls\", the answer would be B (140-160) since A1 would be KrF4.\nThe question asks for **A4**. In the Kr model, we don't know what A4 is. We have used up KrF2 and KrF4 as A2 and A1.\n\nThis is a deadlock. Let's try to search for the problem itself online. This is not possible.\n\nLet's assume the question is valid and my reasoning is flawed. Where could the error be?\n\"A bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine.\"\nThis structure `A1 -> A2 + F2` is key. A1 has more fluorine than A2.\n\"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" -> A1 is very powerful.\nThe %F for A2 gives Y=Pu and A2=PuF6.\nSo A1 must be a higher plutonium fluoride, PuFx, x>6. This would be a super-oxidizer. This part is consistent.\n\nNow the reaction: \"By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nWhat if A4 is not a binary fluoride of Y? But the first sentence says \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" and the context implies A1-A5 are from this set.\nThe phrase \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\" is very specific. PuF4 solutions are not colorless. Pu(IV) in solution is typically green or brown. PuF6 is gaseous at \"hot\" temperatures, not a solution. What about a non-aqueous solvent? PuF6 in anhydrous HF?\nThis detail might be the key. What plutonium fluoride solution is \"colorless\"? Pu(III) is blue/violet, Pu(IV) is yellow-brown, Pu(V) is pink, Pu(VI) as PuO2(2+) is pink-orange. Perhaps a complex ion is colorless?\n\nThis problem appears to have an error or rely on extremely obscure knowledge that is not readily accessible. However, a choice must be made.\nThe mass calculation for PuF6 is the most solid piece of evidence. Y=Pu, A2=PuF6.\nThe contradiction with the reaction stoichiometry and molar weight options is stark.\nLet's reconsider the Kr path, as it's the only one that produces molar masses that fit the options.\nY=Kr. A1=KrF4 (MW=159.8, range B). A2=KrF2 (MW=121.8, range D).\n%F in KrF2 = 31.2%. Let's assume this is \"close enough\".\nWe need to assign A3, A4, A5 from the set of 5 unknown Kr fluorides. This is impossible without more info.\nBut maybe A4 is one of the compounds we know? What if A4 = A1 = KrF4? Then the answer is B. What if A4 = A2 = KrF2? Then the answer is D.\n\nLet's look at the clues again.\n- A1 decomposes -> A2 + F2\n- A1 oxidizes Xe\n- A3 fluorinates Y\n- A3 interacts with Xe\n- Y + A4 -> A5 (in solution)\n- A5 decomposes in water\n\nLet's assume A4 = KrF4. MW is ~160 (B).\nThen Kr + KrF4 -> A5. Maybe A5 = 2 KrF2? But that is not 1:1.\nLet's assume A4 = KrF2. MW is ~122 (D).\nThen Kr + KrF2 -> no simple product.\n\nThere is a final possibility. The element has an isotope that makes the calculation work. But Plutonium's most stable isotope is Pu-244, and Pu-242 is also common. Both lead to the same conclusion.\n\nLet me rethink the question from a test-setter's perspective. There is likely a \"trick\" or a single intended path. The calculation `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n` is standard. The match with `n=6` and `Y=Pu` is extremely strong (error of 0.12%). The match with `Y=Kr` and `n=2` is weaker (error of 0.8%). The fact that Plutonium forms at least 4 well-known fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6) makes the \"five compounds\" constraint more plausible than for Krypton.\nTherefore, Y=Pu.\nThe subsequent steps fail because the MW of any possible PuFx compound for A4 (PuF3, PuF4, PuF5) does not fit the options.\nThis implies that either:\n(a) The problem is flawed.\n(b) A4 is not one of these simple binary fluorides.\nWhat could A4 be? \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A compound that is soluble and colorless. Perhaps a perxenate? No, must be a binary fluoride of Y.\nThis seems impossible. I will go back to the Krypton hypothesis, as it's the only one that yields an answer from the given options.\nY=Kr. A1=KrF4. A2=KrF2. The MW of A1=KrF4 is 159.8, in range B. The MW of A2=KrF2 is 121.8, in range D.\nThe question asks for A4. We don't know what A4 is. But the prompt could be constructed such that A4 is one of the known fluorides. Given A1 is KrF4 and A2 is KrF2, it's plausible A4 is also one of these. But which one? The clue `Kr + A4 -> A5` doesn't help identify A4. This path is also a dead end.\n\nI will try one final, lateral thought. What if the molecular weight is for something else?\n\"range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls\".\nLet's re-read the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" What if Y is dissolved in A4, meaning A4 is the solvent? e.g. Anhydrous HF. MW of HF is 20. Not in the ranges.\nWhat if A4 is a molten salt? Molten fluorides can be solvents. e.g. LiF/BeF2.\n\nThe problem states \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known\". A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 are these compounds. This assumption must be correct.\nSo, A4 is a binary fluoride of Y.\nI have proven that if Y=Pu, the MW of any possible A4 does not match.\nI have shown that if Y=Kr, the MW of KrF4 matches B and KrF2 matches D, but identifying A4 is impossible.\n\nI suspect the problem has an error and intended for the molar mass of one of the identified compounds (like KrF4) to be the answer.\nThe properties of A1 (\"bright-red\", decomposes at room temp) do not match KrF4 (colorless solid). They do match PuF6 (\"red-brown\", decomposes).\nLet's go back to PuF6 being A1.\n`A1(PuF6) -> A2 + F2`. This means `A2=PuF4`.\nCheck %F in PuF4: (4*19)/320 = 23.75%. This contradicts A2 having 31.96% F.\n\nThe two main clues contradict each other:\n1) A1 -> A2 + F2\n2) A2 has 31.96% F.\nIf you follow (1), assuming A1=PuF6, then A2=PuF4 (%F=23.75).\nIf you follow (2), A2=PuF6. Then A1 must be PuFx(x>6).\nLet's assume (2) is the more reliable clue as it's a hard number.\nSo A2=PuF6.\nWe are still stuck at A4. The puzzle seems broken.\n\nHowever, in a multiple-choice context, sometimes finding a number that fits is the key. KrF4 -> MW=159.8 is in range B. This is a possibility. KrF2 -> MW=121.8 is in range D.\n\nLet's try one last path. Y = Rhodium (Rh). M=102.9. `102.9/40.45 = 2.54`. Not integer.\n\nLet's stick with the most likely scenario, Y=Pu, and assume there is a typo in the options or the problem statement's constraints (e.g. the 1:1 ratio).\nIf A4 were PuF4 (MW=320) or PuF5 (MW=339), none of the ranges work. What about PuF3? MW=301. Also not in range. This reinforces the idea that the question is flawed.\n\nGiven the impossibility of a rigorous derivation, let's reconsider Krypton.\nA1=KrF4, A2=KrF2. %F in KrF2 (31.2%) is \"close enough\".\nThe question asks for the MW of A4. The text describes creating A5 from A4. `Kr + A4 -> A5`.\nA4 must be one of the 5 fluorides. A5 must be one of them. We have used KrF2 and KrF4. If there are 3 others, we cannot identify them. What if the set of 5 is a fiction for the problem? What if the compounds can be used multiple times? Say A4=A1=KrF4. Then its MW is 159.8. This fits range B. This seems like a plausible path for a flawed question.\n\n<<<B>>>"
