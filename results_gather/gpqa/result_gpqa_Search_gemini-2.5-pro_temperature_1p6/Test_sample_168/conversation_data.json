    "The user's query describes a nuclear decay process analogous to double-beta decay.\n\n*   **Standard Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V` is analogous to two-neutrino double-beta decay (`2νββ`). Here, `A` and `B` are nucleons, `E` represents electrons, and `V` represents neutrinos.\n*   **Exotic Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M` is analogous to Majoron-emitting neutrinoless double-beta decay (`0νββM`), where `M` is a massless exotic particle (the Majoron).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the comparison:\n\n### Nature of the Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete)\n\nIn any decay with three or more particles in the final state, the available energy (the Q-value) is shared among them. This results in a continuous energy spectrum for any single particle or subset of particles.\n\n1.  **Standard Decay (`2νββ`):** The final state consists of the daughter nucleus (2B), two electrons (2E), and two neutrinos (2V). Because the two neutrinos escape detection and carry away a variable amount of energy, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two electrons is continuously distributed. The spectrum ranges from zero up to an endpoint. This is consistent with the problem statement.\n2.  **Exotic Decay (`0νββM`):** The final state consists of the daughter nucleus (2B), two electrons (2E), and one massless particle (M). This is still a multi-body final state (four bodies including the recoiling nucleus). The energy is shared between the electrons and the Majoron. As a result, the summed energy spectrum of the two electrons remains continuous. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n### Endpoint of the Spectrum\n\nThe endpoint of the electron energy spectrum corresponds to the maximum possible kinetic energy the two electrons can have, which occurs when the other emitted particles carry away the minimum possible energy (zero). The total energy available for the kinetic energy of all products is determined by the Q-value of the decay, which accounts for the difference in rest masses between the initial and final particles.\n\nLet `Q_nuc = m(2A)c² - m(2B)c² - 2m(E)c²` be the energy released by the nuclear transition and electron creation.\n\n1.  **Standard Decay (`2νββ`):** Two V particles (neutrinos) with rest mass `m_V` are created. The total kinetic energy available to all final particles is `K_total_1 = Q_nuc - 2m_V c²`. The endpoint of the summed electron energy spectrum is this total available kinetic energy (assuming the recoil of the heavy nucleus is negligible).\n2.  **Exotic Decay (`0νββM`):** One massless particle M (`m_M = 0`) is created. The total kinetic energy available is `K_total_2 = Q_nuc - m_M c² = Q_nuc`.\n\n**Comparison:**\nSince neutrinos (V) have a small but non-zero mass (`m_V > 0`), the energy `2m_V c²` used to create their rest mass is not available as kinetic energy. In the exotic decay, no rest mass is created for the massless particle M. Therefore, the total kinetic energy available in the exotic decay is greater than in the standard decay.\n\n`Endpoint_exotic = Q_nuc`\n`Endpoint_standard = Q_nuc - 2m_V c²`\n\nSince `Q_nuc > Q_nuc - 2m_V c²`, the endpoint of the energy spectrum increases in the exotic decay scenario.\n\nThus, the spectrum remains continuous, but its shape is altered, and the endpoint energy is higher than in the original decay.\n\n<<<A>>>"
