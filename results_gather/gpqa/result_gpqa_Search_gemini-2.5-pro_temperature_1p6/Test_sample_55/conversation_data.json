    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state via dipole transitions is governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m.\n\n### 1. Selection Rules\n\nFor an electric dipole transition, the selection rules are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, must be ±1.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm, must be 0 or ±1.\n*   There is no selection rule for the principal quantum number, n.\n\n### 2. Decay Pathway\n\nThe atom starts in the state |3,0,0⟩ and decays to the state |1,0,0⟩ through an intermediate state |n',l',m'⟩.\n\n*   **First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩**\n    *   Applying the selection rules to the initial state |3,0,0⟩ (with l=0, m=0):\n        *   Δl = l' - 0 = ±1  ⇒ l' = 1\n        *   Δm = m' - 0 = 0, ±1 ⇒ m' = 0, 1, or -1\n    *   The principal quantum number `n` must decrease for a decay process. A possible intermediate state, as suggested by the options, is one with n'=2.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n*   **Second Transition: |n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n    *   Let's check if a transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ (with l=0, m=0) is allowed. For any of the intermediate states |2,1,m'⟩:\n        *   Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is an allowed change.\n        *   For the transition to be to |1,0,0⟩, the change Δm = 0 - m' must be 0 or ±1. This condition is satisfied for all three possible intermediate states (m'=0, 1, -1).\n    *   Therefore, all three decay routes are possible:\n        1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n        2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n        3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n### 3. Transition Probability\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the first photon. As a result, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the allowed intermediate states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\nSince there are three equally probable decay channels, the probability for the atom to take any single one of these paths is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the transition route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ has a corresponding probability of 1/3.\n\nThe correct choice is:\n$$ |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\n<<<A>>>"
