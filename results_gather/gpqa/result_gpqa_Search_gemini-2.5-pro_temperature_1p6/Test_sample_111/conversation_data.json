    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |α>\n\nThe given state is `|ψ> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nFirst, we need to find the normalization constant, N, such that `|α> = N|ψ>`. The norm squared of the state must be 1.\n\nThe inner product `<ψ|ψ>` is calculated as:\n`<ψ|ψ> = <((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)|((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)>`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1-i)(1+i) <up|up> + (2+i)(2-i) <down|down>`\nSince `|up>` and `|down>` form an orthonormal basis, `<up|up> = 1` and `<down|down> = 1`.\n\n`<ψ|ψ> = |1+i|² + |2-i|²`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1² + 1²) + (2² + (-1)²) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant N is `1/sqrt(<ψ|ψ>) = 1/√7`.\nSo, the normalized state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\n\nIn matrix form, with `|up> = [1, 0]ᵀ` and `|down> = [0, 1]ᵀ`, the state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator A\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = ħ/2` if `i ≠ j` and `Aij = 0` if `i = j`. This gives the following 2x2 matrix:\n`A = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix, `σₓ`.\n\n### 3. Find the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of A\n\nWe need to solve the eigenvalue equation `A|v> = λ|v>`.\n`det(A - λI) = 0`\n`det([[ -λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n`λ₁ = +ħ/2`\n`λ₂ = -ħ/2`\n\nNow we find the corresponding eigenstates:\n\nFor `λ₁ = +ħ/2`:\n`[[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] * [x, y]ᵀ = (ħ/2) * [x, y]ᵀ`\n`[(ħ/2)y, (ħ/2)x]ᵀ = [(ħ/2)x, (ħ/2)y]ᵀ`\nThis implies `y = x`. The normalized eigenstate is `|v₁> = (1/√2) * [1, 1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\nFor `λ₂ = -ħ/2`:\n`[[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] * [x, y]ᵀ = (-ħ/2) * [x, y]ᵀ`\n`[(ħ/2)y, (ħ/2)x]ᵀ = [(-ħ/2)x, (-ħ/2)y]ᵀ`\nThis implies `y = -x`. The normalized eigenstate is `|v₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λᵢ` is given by `P(λᵢ) = |<vᵢ|α>|²`.\n\n**Probability for λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n`P(λ₁) = |<v₁|α>|²`\n`<v₁|α> = (1/√2) * [<up| + <down|] * (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n`<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [(1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i)] = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14`\n`P(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n**Probability for λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n`P(λ₂) = |<v₂|α>|²`\n`<v₂|α> = (1/√2) * [<up| - <down|] * (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n`<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [(1)(1+i) - (1)(2-i)] = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14`\n`P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. As a check, `9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`.\n\n### 5. Find the Average Value of the Operator\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n\n**Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n`<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)`\n`<A> = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7`\n\n**Method 2: Using the definition `<A> = <α|A|α>`**\n`<A> = (1/√7) * [(1-i), (2+i)] * (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [(1-i), (2+i)] * [2-i, 1+i]ᵀ`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [(2 - i - 2i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²)]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * 2 = ħ/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `ħ/7`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
