    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the product from the provided theoretical NMR data.\n\n**Product's Molecular Formula:** The reaction is an isomerization, so the product has the same molecular formula as the starting material, Compound X, which is C11H12O.\n\n**¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a ketone, as there's no aldehyde proton signal in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s):** These are signals for two separate carbon atoms, consistent with two methyl groups.\n*   **δ 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s):** These signals are in the aromatic/vinylic region. The presence of two signals that each account for two carbons (126.9 and 129.1) strongly suggests a symmetrically substituted aromatic ring, such as a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**¹H NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two singlets, each integrating to three protons, confirming the presence of two methyl groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n*   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d):** These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of the four protons on a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d):** These two doublets, each for one proton, indicate two coupled protons, likely across a double bond (-CH=CH-).\n\n**Assembling the Product's Structure:**\nBased on the NMR analysis, the product contains:\n*   A ketone group (-CO-)\n*   Two methyl groups (-CH₃)\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   A carbon-carbon double bond with a proton on each carbon (-CH=CH-)\n\nThe only way to assemble these fragments to match the molecular formula C11H12O is as (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This structure is consistent with the NMR data, including two distinct methyl singlets (one on the aromatic ring and one attached to the carbonyl group).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Identify Compound X\n\nThe reaction involves heating Compound X with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base, which facilitates an isomerization. This means Compound X is an isomer of the product, (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. A known reaction mediated by DABCO under thermal conditions is the Meinwald rearrangement of epoxides to carbonyl compounds.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options for Compound X:\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** The styryl group implies a C₆H₅- (phenyl) group, which lacks the methyl substituent found on the aromatic ring of the product.\n*   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** This name is ambiguous, but commonly refers to (2-phenylethenyl)oxirane, which has the formula C₁₀H₁₀O, not C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound also contains a phenyl group, not the p-tolyl group (4-methylphenyl) required to form the product.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The 4-methylstyryl group is p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-. This compound has the correct molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O) and contains the necessary p-tolyl group.\n\nThe reaction is the base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide. The starting material, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, isomerizes to form the α,β-unsaturated ketone, 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This transformation is a known chemical process.\n\nTherefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
