    "The search results confirm my physical reasoning and the formula I derived.\n\nSpecifically:\n- Source mentions the process γγ → e+e− with CMB photons and gives the threshold energy formula as mₑ²/εb, where εb is the energy of the background photon. This is identical to my derived formula Eγ = (mₑc²)² / E_CMB.\n- Several sources mention a threshold energy around 400 TeV for this process. Let's convert this to GeV. 400 TeV = 400 * 10³ GeV = 4 * 10⁵ GeV.\n- Let's re-examine the input values. My calculation used E_CMB = 10⁻³ eV. However, the CMB is a blackbody spectrum, and the \"average\" energy can be defined in different ways (e.g., peak energy vs. mean energy).\n- Source mentions a mean energy of about 6.35 × 10⁻⁴ eV.\n- Source mentions using a monoenergetic approximation of Eγ = 6.34 × 10⁻⁴(1 +z) eV. At z=0 (present day), this is 6.34 x 10⁻⁴ eV.\n- Let's recalculate with this more precise value for the average CMB photon energy:\n    *   E_CMB = 6.35 x 10⁻⁴ eV\n    *   mₑc² = 0.511 * 10⁶ eV\n    *   Eγ = (mₑc²)² / E_CMB\n    *   Eγ = (0.511 * 10⁶ eV)² / (6.35 x 10⁻⁴ eV)\n    *   Eγ = (0.261121 * 10¹²) / (6.35 x 10⁻⁴) eV\n    *   Eγ = (0.261121 / 6.35) * 10¹⁶ eV\n    *   Eγ = 0.04112 * 10¹⁶ eV\n    *   Eγ = 4.112 * 10¹⁴ eV\n- Now, convert this to GeV:\n    *   Eγ = (4.112 * 10¹⁴) / 10⁹ GeV\n    *   Eγ = 4.112 * 10⁵ GeV\n- This value (4.1 * 10⁵ GeV) is close to option D (3.9 * 10⁵ GeV) and consistent with the ~400 TeV (~4 * 10⁵ GeV) threshold mentioned in sources and.\n\nWhat if I use the value given in the problem, E_CMB = 10⁻³ eV?\nMy original calculation was:\nEγ = 2.61 * 10⁵ GeV.\nThis matches option C exactly.\n\nIt seems the question intends for the specific value of E_CMB = 10⁻³ eV to be used, even if the true mean energy of the CMB is slightly different. The result of the calculation using the provided data points directly to one of the answers. The purpose of the more accurate value from the literature was to act as a check on my reasoning, and the result is of the same order of magnitude (10⁵ GeV), which gives confidence. The slight discrepancy comes from the simplified value for E_CMB provided in the prompt.\n\nTherefore, I should stick with the calculation based on the numbers given in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Process**: High-energy gamma-ray (γ) collides with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon (γ_CMB) to produce an electron-positron pair (e⁺e⁻). The reaction is γ + γ_CMB → e⁺ + e⁻.\n2.  **Threshold Condition**: For this reaction to be possible, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least the rest mass energy of the products. The rest mass of an electron is mₑc² ≈ 0.511 MeV, and a positron has the same mass. So, the minimum energy required to create the pair is 2mₑc².\n3.  **Relativistic Kinematics**: The threshold energy for the incoming gamma-ray (Eγ) is lowest when the collision is head-on. The formula for this threshold energy is:\n    Eγ = (mₑc²)² / E_CMB\n4.  **Given Values**:\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron (mₑc²): 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10⁶ eV.\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon (E_CMB): 10⁻³ eV (as stated in the problem).\n5.  **Calculation**:\n    *   First, square the rest mass energy of the electron:\n        (mₑc²)² = (0.511 x 10⁶ eV)² = 0.261121 x 10¹² eV²\n    *   Next, divide this by the energy of the CMB photon:\n        Eγ = (0.261121 x 10¹² eV²) / (10⁻³ eV) = 0.261121 x 10¹⁵ eV\n    *   Finally, convert the energy from electron-volts (eV) to giga-electron-volts (GeV). Since 1 GeV = 10⁹ eV:\n        Eγ = (0.261121 x 10¹⁵ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV) = 0.261121 x 10⁶ GeV\n    *   Expressing this in the format of the options:\n        Eγ = 2.61121 x 10⁵ GeV\n6.  **Conclusion**: This calculated value of approximately 2.6 x 10⁵ GeV matches option C. Source independently confirms that the threshold energy formula is m²/εb, justifying the calculation method. While other sources use a slightly different average energy for the CMB leading to a result closer to 4 x 10⁵ GeV, the inputs provided in the question lead directly to answer C.\n\nFinal Answer seems to be C.The calculation based on the problem's given values is straightforward and leads directly to one of the options.\n\nEγ = (mₑc²)² / E_CMB\nEγ = (0.511 * 10⁶ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)\nEγ = 0.2611 * 10¹⁵ eV\nEγ = 2.611 * 10¹⁴ eV? No, 10¹⁵. Let's re-do the powers.\n(10⁶)² = 10¹².\n10¹² / 10⁻³ = 10¹⁵.\nSo Eγ = 0.2611 x 10¹⁵ eV.\nConvert to GeV (divide by 10⁹):\nEγ = 0.2611 x 10⁶ GeV\nEγ = 2.611 x 10⁵ GeV.\n\nThe calculation is correct. The result matches option C.\n\nThe problem asks from what energy γ-rays would have their lifetimes limited. This implies finding the minimum energy (the threshold) at which this interaction can occur, as any gamma-ray with energy above this threshold will be susceptible to this interaction and thus have a limited mean free path, or lifetime, in the universe. My calculation of the threshold energy is the correct approach.\n\nI am ready to provide the final answer.To determine the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray (γ) to annihilate with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron pair (e⁺e⁻), we must consider the principles of special relativity and energy conservation.\n\nThe reaction is:\nγ + γ_CMB → e⁺ + e⁻\n\nFor this interaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least the rest mass energy of the two particles being created, an electron and a positron. The rest mass of an electron is mₑ, and its rest energy is mₑc². A positron has an identical mass. Thus, the minimum energy required to create the pair is 2mₑc².\n\nThe threshold energy (Eγ) for the high-energy photon is found when the collision is most efficient, which is a head-on collision. The formula for the threshold energy in this scenario is derived from the invariance of the four-momentum squared and is given by:\n\nE_γ = (mₑc²)² / E_CMB\n\nHere:\n*   **mₑc²** is the rest mass energy of an electron, which is approximately 0.511 MeV (Mega-electron-volts).\n*   **E_CMB** is the average energy of a CMB photon, given in the problem as 10⁻³ eV.\n\nFirst, we need to express all energy values in the same units (electron-volts, eV):\n*   mₑc² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 × 10⁶ eV\n*   E_CMB = 10⁻³ eV\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\nE_γ = (0.511 × 10⁶ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)\nE_γ = (0.261121 × 10¹² eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)\nE_γ = 0.261121 × 10¹⁵ eV\n\nThe final step is to convert this energy from eV to Giga-electron-volts (GeV), as given in the options. We know that 1 GeV = 10⁹ eV.\n\nE_γ = (0.261121 × 10¹⁵ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)\nE_γ = 0.261121 × 10⁶ GeV\nE_γ = 2.61121 × 10⁵ GeV\n\nThis result, approximately 2.6 × 10⁵ GeV, corresponds directly to option C. The question asks from what energy this process begins to limit the lifetime of gamma-rays, which is precisely this calculated threshold energy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
