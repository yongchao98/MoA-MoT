    "To determine the lower limit on the redshift of objects detectable via their Lyman-alpha absorption, we must consider the wavelength of this spectral line and the limitations of ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n*   **Lyman-alpha Wavelength:** The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) spectral line is part of the Lyman series of hydrogen and corresponds to an electron transitioning from the n=2 to the n=1 energy level. Its rest wavelength (λ_rest) is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å), or 121.6 nanometers. This wavelength falls in the ultraviolet (UV) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n*   **Atmospheric Cutoff:** Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone, absorbs most of the incoming UV radiation. Ground-based optical telescopes can only detect light at wavelengths longer than this atmospheric cutoff, which is approximately 3200 Å (320 nm). Some sources indicate that for practical observations, this limit can be considered closer to 3300-3500 Å.\n\n*   **Redshift Calculation:** The cosmological redshift describes the stretching of light's wavelength as it travels through the expanding universe. The relationship between the observed wavelength (λ_obs) and the rest wavelength (λ_rest) is given by the formula: `z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1`. For the Lyα line to be detectable from the ground, its rest wavelength of 1216 Å must be redshifted to an observed wavelength of at least 3200 Å.\n\nUsing the atmospheric cutoff as the minimum observed wavelength, we can calculate the minimum redshift (`z`):\n\n`z = (3200 Å / 1216 Å) - 1`\n`z ≈ 2.63 - 1`\n`z ≈ 1.63`\n\nThis is a theoretical minimum. In practice, due to severe atmospheric extinction near the cutoff and the need for sufficient signal, a slightly higher redshift is often required for efficient detection. For instance, some research mentions that direct ground-based observations of neutral hydrogen using the Lyman-alpha transition are restricted to redshifts of z ≳ 1.7. If we use a more practical cutoff of 3500 Å for better atmospheric transmission, the calculation becomes:\n\n`z = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1`\n`z ≈ 2.88 - 1`\n`z ≈ 1.88`\n\nThis calculated value of approximately 1.88 is very close to one of the provided options.\n\nGiven the options, the value of 1.9 represents the most realistic lower limit for efficiently detecting redshifted Lyman-alpha absorption with ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
