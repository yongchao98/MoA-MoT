    "### Analysis of Reactions\n\n#### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The alpha-carbons to the carbonyl (C1) are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It has no protons and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen. It has one alpha-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation must occur at C6, forming a single regioisomeric enolate.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate anion at C6 attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the `CH2` group of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:** The resulting product has the original ketone structure with a new `–CH2CH2COOEt` group attached at the C6 position. To determine the correct IUPAC name from the options, we can name this structure by treating the ester as the principal functional group. In this naming system, the cyclohexanone ring becomes a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The substituent is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is numbered starting with C1 as the point of attachment. This was C6 in the original ketone.\n    *   The carbonyl group of the ketone is now at position C2 (originally C1).\n    *   The ethyl and methyl groups are at position C3 (originally C2).\n    *   The methyl group that was on C6 is now on C1 of the new numbering system.\n    *   Following alphabetical order for substituents, the name of the cyclohexyl group is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Thus, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n#### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\nThis reaction is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the primary nitroalkane.\n\n1.  **Carbanion Formation:** 1-nitropropane (`CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂`) has acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon). KOH removes a proton from this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion (`CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`).\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The nitronate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). The attack occurs at the carbon bearing the methyl group.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this compound, the nitrile group (–CN) has the highest priority and defines the parent chain, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1. The longest chain has six carbons.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
