    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its parent star and the energy it radiates away. The formula for the equilibrium temperature is:\n\n`T_eq ∝ ( (1 - A) / a^2 )^(1/4)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `A` is the albedo (reflectivity) of the planet.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the average distance from the star).\n\nFor this problem, we are comparing two planets orbiting the same star. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A`). Therefore, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to a dependency on their semi-major axes:\n\n`T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)`\n\n### 2. Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states:\n\n`P^2 ∝ a^3`\n\nThis can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n\n`a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet_2 and Planet_4 is:\n\n`a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\n### 3. Combining the Relationships\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for the ratio of the semi-major axes into the temperature ratio equation:\n\n`T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = ( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)`\n\n`T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods (P) for the five planets as 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5. From this, we have:\n\n*   P₂ corresponds to the value 2.\n*   P₄ corresponds to the value 3.5.\n\nPlugging these values into the final equation:\n\n`T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\nFirst, simplify the fraction:\n\n`2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7`\n\nNow, calculate the cube root:\n\n`Ratio = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8299`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
