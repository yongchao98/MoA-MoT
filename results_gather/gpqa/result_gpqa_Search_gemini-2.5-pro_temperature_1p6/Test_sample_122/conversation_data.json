    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. To find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame, we must first determine the time elapsed in that frame, which will be different from the time measured in the ejecta's frame.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information**:\n    *   Relative velocity (v) = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   Time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta), known as proper time (Δt₀) = 50 s.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Understand Time Dilation**:\n    According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for a moving object appears to pass slower than for a stationary observer. The time measured in the reference frame where the event is at rest (the ejecta's clock) is called proper time. The time measured by an observer in a different reference frame (the Galaxy) will be longer. This effect is known as time dilation.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**:\n    The relationship between time in the two reference frames is governed by the Lorentz factor (γ). The formula for the Lorentz factor is γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light (β = v/c):\n        β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        β² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n    *   Now, calculate the Lorentz factor:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96) ≈ 1.0206\n\n4.  **Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt)**:\n    The time dilation formula is Δt = γ * Δt₀, where Δt is the time observed in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n    *   Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s\n    *   Δt ≈ 51.03 s\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Reference Frame**:\n    The distance the ejecta travels from the perspective of the Galaxy is its velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Distance = v * Δt\n    *   Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s\n    *   Distance ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\nThis result is very close to 3,060,000 km. The minor difference is due to rounding during intermediate steps. Therefore, the most accurate option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
