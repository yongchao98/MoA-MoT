    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents. The ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms and, in a di-substituted form, 4 hydrogen atoms (C6H4).\n    *   **Total of 8 carbon atoms:** Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons.\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** The other substituent is a halogen (e.g., -Cl, -Br) attached directly to the aromatic ring. Halogens do not contain carbon atoms.\n    *   From this, we can deduce the structure. The halogen is one substituent. The other substituent must contain the two remaining carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n2.  **Determine the Plausible Structure:**\n    *   The compound is a halo-substituted acetophenone. The molecular formula is X-C6H4-COCH3 (where X is a halogen).\n    *   The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The pattern of the signals in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) will reveal this arrangement.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   **Option A:** This option shows no signals in the aromatic region, which is incorrect for an aromatic compound.\n    *   **Option B: `1H NMR: Î´ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** It shows two doublets (`d`), each integrating to two protons (`2H`). This \"two-doublet\" pattern is a classic signature for a *para* (1,4) di-substituted benzene ring, where the two protons on one side of the ring are equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side are also equivalent. This results in two sets of protons splitting each other.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** It shows a singlet (`s`) for three protons (`3H`) at 2.3 ppm. This is the characteristic chemical shift and multiplicity for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetyl group, -COCH3). The signal is a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon to cause splitting.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This data perfectly matches the proposed structure of a *para*-haloacetophenone. For instance, the 1H NMR spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows signals at approximately 7.57 ppm (d, 2H), 7.09 ppm (d, 2H), and 2.28 ppm (s, 3H), which is highly consistent with this option.\n    *   **Option C:** The integration (total number of protons) and chemical shifts do not match the proposed structure.\n    *   **Option D:** This option shows the *para* substitution pattern in the aromatic region but also includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm. This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The proposed structure is a ketone.\n\n4.  **Final Identification:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the compound is a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n    *   The NMR data in Option B, featuring two doublets in the aromatic region for a total of four protons and a three-proton singlet around 2.3 ppm for the acetyl methyl group, is the only one that correctly represents this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
