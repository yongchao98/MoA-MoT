    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under a specific set of ideal conditions. Analyzing the options provided:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This statement is incorrect. The Mott-Gurney law requires an Ohmic contact that provides an unlimited supply of carriers, not a Schottky contact which creates an energy barrier to injection.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement accurately describes the ideal conditions for the Mott-Gurney law. The key assumptions are:\n    *   **Single-carrier device:** Only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) contributes to the current.\n    *   **Trap-free:** There are no charge traps within the material that would capture carriers and affect the current flow.\n    *   **No carrier injection barrier:** This is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact, which can supply enough charge carriers to sustain the space-charge-limited current.\n    *   **Negligible diffusion current:** The model assumes the current is dominated by the drift of carriers under the influence of the electric field, while the current from carrier concentration gradients (diffusion) is ignored.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This statement is incorrect. The space-charge-limited current is fundamentally a drift current; therefore, neglecting the drift current is contrary to the model's basis.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This statement is incorrect. The classic Mott-Gurney law is derived for a single-carrier (unipolar) device.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
