    "The experiment described involves several key immunological events that point to a specific process. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery and Targeting**: The rotavirus proteins are delivered orally. This route targets the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), of which the Peyer's patches are a major component. Peyer's patches are crucial for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n\n2.  **Antigen Uptake and Immune Activation**: The fluorescent viral proteins that survive the stomach and mucus are taken up in the Peyer's patches. This leads to the activation and proliferation of B cells that recognize the antigen.\n\n3.  **Germinal Center Reaction**: The identification of fluorescent Peyer's patches containing a *proliferating cell population* indicates the formation of germinal centers (GCs). GCs are specialized microenvironments within secondary lymphoid organs where activated B cells undergo intense proliferation.\n\n4.  **Generation of Antibody Diversity**: The crucial finding is the \"high variability\" observed in the *variable heavy chain gene* of these proliferating B cells. This points directly to somatic hypermutation (SHM). SHM is a process that introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. This process only happens in activated B cells within germinal centers. Its purpose is to generate B cell variants with receptors that have a higher affinity for the antigen. This selection of higher-affinity B cells is known as affinity maturation.\n\nComparing this with the other options:\n*   **A) VDJ recombination**: This is the initial process that assembles the variable region genes from V, D, and J segments. It creates the primary antibody diversity *before* a B cell encounters an antigen, and it occurs in the bone marrow, not in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches.\n*   **C) Complement activation**: This is a component of the innate immune system and does not involve the genetic mutation of B cell receptors.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination**: This process also occurs in germinal centers and often concurrently with SHM. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (determining the antibody class, e.g., IgM to IgA), not the *variable* region, which is responsible for antigen binding and where the high variability was observed.\n\nTherefore, the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating B cells within the Peyer's patches after antigen exposure is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
