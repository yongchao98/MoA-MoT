    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, 4, and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Diene and Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   The first reactant is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, a norbornadiene derivative that will act as the dienophile.\n*   The second reactant, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, is treated with sodium iodide (NaI) at an elevated temperature. The reaction of gem-dibromides with NaI is a method for generating reactive intermediates. In this case, the precursor will undergo elimination of bromine to form 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (also known asdendralene), a reactive diene.\n*   This in-situ generated diene then reacts with the norbornadiene derivative in a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, the diene will react with both double bonds of the norbornadiene. This forms **Product 1**, a large polycyclic molecule where two diene molecules have added to the norbornadiene core.\n\n**Step 2: Deprotection of the tert-Butyl Ether**\n\n*   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This acidic condition cleaves the tert-butoxy ether, removing the tert-butyl protecting group from the oxygen atom at the C7 position of the bicyclic core.\n*   This hydrolysis reaction converts the ether into a secondary alcohol (-OH). This forms **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation of the Alcohol**\n\n*   Product 2 is treated with a sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation). This is a mild oxidizing agent that converts the secondary alcohol at the C7 position into a ketone (C=O).\n*   This forms **Product 3**, a complex polycyclic ketone.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Pyrolysis)**\n\n*   Product 3 is heated to 150°C. This temperature promotes a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. The protecting groups (the two diene adducts) are removed, regenerating the double bonds in the norbornane core. This step is essentially the reverse of Step 1.\n*   The initial products of this thermal decomposition are two molecules of the diene (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene) and one molecule of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one.\n*   Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one is known to be unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination at elevated temperatures to extrude a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   The other product, 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (a C₈H₈ isomer), is also unstable at this temperature and will thermally rearrange to a more stable aromatic isomer, a xylene (C₈H₁₀). The most plausible interpretation, which leads to one of the given answers, is that it rearranges to meta-xylene (1,3-dimethylbenzene).\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on **Product 4**. Given the options, it is most likely referring to the xylene product formed from the diene portion of the molecule.\n\n**Analysis of m-Xylene**\n\nLet's determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in m-xylene (1,3-dimethylbenzene):\n1.  **Methyl hydrogens:** The two methyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's C₂v symmetry. The six hydrogens on these two groups are chemically equivalent. (1 signal)\n2.  **Aromatic hydrogen at C2:** This hydrogen is situated between the two methyl groups and is unique. (1 signal)\n3.  **Aromatic hydrogens at C4 and C6:** These two hydrogens are equivalent by symmetry. (1 signal)\n4.  **Aromatic hydrogen at C5:** This hydrogen is opposite the C2 hydrogen and is unique. (1 signal)\n\nTherefore, m-xylene has a total of four chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
