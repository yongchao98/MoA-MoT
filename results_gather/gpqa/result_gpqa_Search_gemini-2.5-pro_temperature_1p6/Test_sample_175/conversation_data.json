    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the initial state vector\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix (ket) `|ψ⟩`:\n```\n|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T\n```\nFirst, we need to find the squared norm of this vector, which is the inner product `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\nThe normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is obtained by dividing the vector by its norm (`√⟨ψ|ψ⟩`):\n```\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T\n```\n\n### Step 2: Find the eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector for the measurement of P\n\nThe operator for the observable P is given by the matrix:\n```\nP = [[0, 1/√2, 0],\n     [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n     [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n```\nThe possible outcomes of the measurement of P are its eigenvalues. We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. The eigenvector equation is `P|v⟩ = λ|v⟩`. For an eigenvalue of 0, this simplifies to `P|v⟩ = 0`.\n\nLet the eigenvector `|v_p0⟩` be `[x, y, z]^T`. Then:\n```\n[[0, 1/√2, 0],\n [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T\n```\nThis gives the following system of equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x + z = 0 => x = -z`\n3.  `(1/√2)y = 0`\n\nA non-trivial eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 can be written by choosing `z = -1`, which gives `x = 1` and `y = 0`:\n```\n|v_p0⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T\n```\nNext, we normalize this eigenvector:\n`⟨v_p0|v_p0⟩ = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`\nThe normalized eigenvector `|v_p0_norm⟩` is:\n```\n|v_p0_norm⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T\n```\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability of measuring 0 for P\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n`Prob(P=0) = |⟨v_p0_norm|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n\nFirst, calculate the inner product `⟨v_p0_norm|ψ_norm⟩`:\n`⟨v_p0_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]] * [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T]`\n`= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*1)`\n`= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n\nThe probability is the square of this value:\n`Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n### Step 4: Determine the state of the system after the first measurement\n\nWhen an observable is measured, the state of the system collapses to the eigenvector corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. After measuring P and getting the result 0, the new state of the system `|ψ'⟩` is the normalized eigenvector `|v_p0_norm⟩`.\n```\n|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T\n```\n\n### Step 5: Find the eigenvector for the measurement of Q\n\nThe operator for the observable Q is:\n```\nQ = [[1, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, -1]]\n```\nThis is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, and -1. The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. We are interested in the eigenvalue -1. The corresponding eigenvector `|v_q-1⟩` is:\n```\n|v_q-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T\n```\nThis vector is already normalized.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the probability of measuring -1 for Q\n\nNow we calculate the probability of measuring -1 for Q, given the system is in the new state `|ψ'⟩`.\n`Prob(Q=-1) = |⟨v_q-1|ψ'⟩|²`\n\nCalculate the inner product `⟨v_q-1|ψ'⟩`:\n`⟨v_q-1|ψ'⟩ = [[0, 0, 1]] * [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T]`\n`= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))`\n`= -1/√2`\n\nThe probability is the square of this value:\n`Prob(Q=-1) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the final combined probability\n\nThe probability of two consecutive, independent events in this context is the product of their individual probabilities.\n`Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n`Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<B>>>"
