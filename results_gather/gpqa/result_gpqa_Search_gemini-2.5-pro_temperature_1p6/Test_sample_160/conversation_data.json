    "To determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2, we need to analyze the physics of mean free path for the two different scenarios.\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules (λ1):** This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. In this scenario, all particles (the \"projectile\" molecule and the \"target\" molecules) are in motion. The standard formula for this is:\n    *   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)\n    *   Here, 'n' is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   σ₁ is the collision cross-section for two molecules hitting each other. In a simplified hard-sphere model, this cross-section is πd², where 'd' is the diameter of the molecule.\n    *   The √2 factor accounts for the relative motion of the colliding molecules.\n\n2.  **Mean Free Path of Electrons (λ2):** This is the average distance an electron travels before colliding with a gas molecule. There are two key differences from the first scenario:\n    *   **Relative Motion:** The electrons, accelerated by 1000 kV, are traveling much faster than the gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets. This means the √2 factor is not needed in the denominator.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (σ₂):** The electron is effectively a point particle compared to the gas molecule. A collision occurs if the electron passes within a circle defined by the radius 'r' of the gas molecule. Thus, the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule (σ₂) is approximately πr².\n\n**Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n\nLet's establish the relationship between the two collision cross-sections:\n*   σ₁ (molecule-molecule) ≈ πd² = π(2r)² = 4πr²\n*   σ₂ (electron-molecule) ≈ πr²\n*   Therefore, σ₁ ≈ 4σ₂.\n\nNow we can write the formulas for the mean free paths in terms of σ₂:\n*   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁) = 1 / (√2 * n * 4σ₂)\n*   λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂)\n\nTo find the relationship between them, we can take their ratio:\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ₂)] / [1 / (4√2 * n * σ₂)]\nλ₂ / λ₁ = 4√2\n\nSince the square root of 2 is approximately 1.414:\nλ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nThis means λ₂ is approximately 5.66 times larger than λ₁.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis shows that λ₂ is significantly greater than λ₁. Let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect, as λ₂ is much larger.\n*   B) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. Our calculated ratio of ~5.66 is well above 1.22.\n*   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect.\n\nThe physical differences between a molecule-molecule collision and an electron-molecule collision lead to a much longer mean free path for the electron.\n\n<<<C>>>"
