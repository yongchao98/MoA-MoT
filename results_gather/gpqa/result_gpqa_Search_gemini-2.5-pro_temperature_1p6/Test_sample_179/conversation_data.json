    "The minimum energy of the described system is calculated by summing the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. The system consists of two parts: the interaction between the central charge and the 12 surface charges, and the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere's surface.\n\n### 1. Defining the System and Constants:\n*   **Number of particles:** 13\n*   **Charge of each particle (q):** 2e, where 'e' is the elementary charge.\n*   **Elementary Charge (e):** 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.\n*   **Particle Charge (q):** 2 × (1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) = 3.204353268 × 10⁻¹⁹ C\n*   **Radius of the sphere (R):** 2 m\n*   **Coulomb's Constant (k):** 8.9875517923 × 10⁹ N·m²/C².\n\n### 2. Energy of Interaction with the Central Charge:\nThe potential energy (E_center) between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere is calculated. Each of the 12 surface charges is at a distance R from the central charge.\n\n**E_center = 12 × (k × q²) / R**\n\n### 3. Energy of Interaction between Surface Charges:\nTo achieve a minimum energy state, the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere will arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible. This configuration is a classic problem in physics known as the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the lowest energy configuration is at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy (E_surface) is the sum of the energies of all pairs of these 12 charges. An icosahedron has 12 vertices, and the distances between any vertex and the others fall into three categories:\n*   **5 nearest neighbors** at a distance d₁.\n*   **5 next-nearest neighbors** at a distance d₂.\n*   **1 diametrically opposite neighbor** at a distance d₃ = 2R.\n\nThe total number of pairs is (12 × 11) / 2 = 66. These pairs are distributed as:\n*   30 pairs at distance d₁ (the edges of the icosahedron).\n*   30 pairs at distance d₂.\n*   6 pairs at distance d₃.\n\nThe distances d₁ and d₂ in terms of the sphere's radius R are:\n*   d₁ = R × √(2 - 2/√5) ≈ 2 × 1.0515 m = 2.103 m\n*   d₂ = R × √(2 + 2/√5) ≈ 2 × 1.7013 m = 3.403 m\n*   d₃ = 2R = 4 m\n\nThe total surface energy is:\n**E_surface = k × q² × (30/d₁ + 30/d₂ + 6/d₃)**\n\n### 4. Total Minimum Energy:\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n\n**E_total = E_center + E_surface**\n\n**E_total = [12 × (k × q²) / R] + [k × q² × (30/d₁ + 30/d₂ + 6/d₃)]**\n\nPlugging in the values for the constants and calculated distances:\n*   k × q² = (8.98755... × 10⁹) × (3.20435... × 10⁻¹⁹)² ≈ 9.2289 × 10⁻²⁸ J·m\n*   E_center = 12 × (9.2289 × 10⁻²⁸ J·m) / 2 m ≈ 5.537 × 10⁻²⁷ J\n*   E_surface = (9.2289 × 10⁻²⁸ J·m) × (30/2.103 + 30/3.403 + 6/4) m⁻¹ ≈ 2.268 × 10⁻²⁶ J\n\nSumming the two energy components:\n*   E_total ≈ (0.5537 × 10⁻²⁶ J) + (2.268 × 10⁻²⁶ J)\n*   **E_total ≈ 2.822 × 10⁻²⁶ J**\n\n<<<A>>>"
