    "This problem can be solved using the principles of Einstein's special theory of relativity, specifically time dilation. Time dilation is the phenomenon where time passes at different rates for different observers depending on their relative motion. For the astronaut traveling near the speed of light, time will pass much slower than for a stationary observer on Earth.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n### 1. Determine the Distance\nFirst, we need to know the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to Earth. The LMC is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n\n### 2. Calculate Travel Time in Earth's Reference Frame\nFor an observer on Earth, the time it would take for the spacecraft to travel this distance is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed.\n\n*   **Distance (L₀):** 163,000 light-years\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c (where 'c' is the speed of light)\n\nTime (Δt) = Distance / Speed = 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987 * c\nSince a light-year is the distance light travels in one year, this calculation simplifies to:\nΔt ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 years ≈ 163,000.021 years\n\nThis is the time that would pass on Earth during the journey.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Time for the Astronaut (Time Dilation)\nTo find the time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time, Δt₀), we use the time dilation formula derived from the Lorentz transformation.\n\nThe formula is:\nΔt₀ = Δt * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term inside the square root:\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   (v/c)² = 0.99999987² ≈ 0.9999997400000169\n*   1 - (v/c)² = 1 - 0.9999997400000169 = 0.0000002599999831\n*   √(1 - v²/c²) ≈ √0.00000026 ≈ 0.0005099\n\nNow, we can calculate the astronaut's experienced time:\nΔt₀ ≈ 163,000.021 years * 0.0005099\nΔt₀ ≈ 83.11 years\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe journey for the astronaut will take approximately 83.11 years from their point of view. The closest answer choice is 81 years, with the minor difference likely resulting from using a slightly different distance to the LMC or a rounded value for the speed. Based on the standard distance and the provided speed, the calculated time is closest to this option.\n\nThe astronaut begins the journey at 22 years old. The travel time will be about 81-83 years.\n*   Age at arrival = 22 + 81 = 103 years old.\n\nSince the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey.\n\n<<<D>>>"
