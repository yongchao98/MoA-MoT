    "My step-by-step logical deduction is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **Substance X Identification**: The properties strongly point to Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   It is the deuterated analog of Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry used to reduce esters, carboxylic acids, and amides. The problem states X's analog is a common reagent.\n    *   It reacts violently with water (and thus with heavy water, Y) to release hydrogen gas (in this case, D₂).\n    *   The reaction with water produces a precipitate. LiAlH₄ reacts with water to form LiOH and Al(OH)₃. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a precipitate. Therefore, the reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would produce Al(OD)₃ as the precipitate (G).\n    *   Heating a hydroxide precipitate like Al(OD)₃ would release water (in this case, heavy water, B).\n    *   The reduction of a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) by LiAlH₄ yields a diol (which has 2 oxygen atoms). This matches the clue about the reaction with a keto acid.\n\n*   **Gas W Identification**: The gas W, released in the reaction, has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Deuterium gas (D₂), which would be released from the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O, fits this description perfectly. A single deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. While other molecules like Helium-4, Nitrogen-14, and Oxygen-16 also have this property, D₂ is the chemically logical product.\n\n*   **Substance B Identification**: Substance B is released upon heating precipitate G and has a melting point near 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K, which is extremely close to 277 K. This confirms B is heavy water.\n\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n    *   The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum.\n    *   The problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the substance.\n    *   **Lightest element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 u. Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8 u.\n    *   **Heaviest element (Aluminum)**: There is one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass of the stable isotope ²⁷Al is approximately 27 u. Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27 u.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum**: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe logic holds and is supported by the performed searches. The final answer is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
