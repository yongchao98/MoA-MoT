    "The problem of calculating the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the method of images.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nA grounded conducting sphere has a constant potential of zero (V=0) on its surface. When a point charge `q` is brought near it, a surface charge is induced on the sphere to maintain this zero potential. The electric field and potential outside the sphere can be accurately modeled by replacing the sphere with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" inside the sphere's original volume.\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n*   **Magnitude (q'):** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position (b):** Located at a distance `b = R²/d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the attractive force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nA key concept is that the potential energy of interaction between a point charge and the charges it induces on a conductor is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges (or, equivalently, by the image charge).\n\nLet's calculate `V_induced`:\n1.  The potential is created by the image charge `q' = -qR/d`.\n2.  The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b = R²/d`) is `d - b`.\n3.  `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n4.  The potential `V_induced` at distance `d` is `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant.\n5.  Substituting the values for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nNow, we can find the potential energy `U`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n*   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy `U = -(1/2) * k*q²*R / (d² - R²)` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
