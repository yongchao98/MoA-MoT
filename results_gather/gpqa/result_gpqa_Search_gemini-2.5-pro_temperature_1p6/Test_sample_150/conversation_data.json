    "To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable `P` will yield the value 0, we follow the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector\nThe state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n`|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`\n\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\nThe normalization constant is `1/√6`. The normalized state vector is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n### 2. Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Observable `P`\nThe observable `P` is given by the matrix:\n`P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]) = 0`\n`-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0`\n`-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n`-λ³ + λ = 0`\n`λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n\nThis gives the eigenvalues `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`. The possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator.\n\n### 3. Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue 0\nThe question asks for the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0. We need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to `λ = 0` by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`:\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0]`\n\nThis results in the system of equations:\n1.  `y/√2 = 0`  ⇒  `y = 0`\n2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0`  ⇒  `x + z = 0`  ⇒  `x = -z`\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. Choosing `x = 1`, we get the unnormalized eigenvector:\n`|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]`\n\n### 4. Normalize the Eigenvector\nNext, we normalize the eigenvector `|v₀⟩`:\nThe squared norm is `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector `|v₀_norm⟩` is:\n`|v₀_norm⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Probability\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the inner product (projection) of the normalized state vector onto the normalized eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue. The probability `Prob(λ=0)` is given by `|⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n\nFirst, compute the inner product `⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩`:\n`⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]] * [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]]`\n`= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n`= (1/√12) * (-1 - 1) = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n\nNow, square the magnitude to find the probability:\n`Prob(λ=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\nTherefore, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
