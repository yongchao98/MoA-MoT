    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nCyclohexanone reacts with bromine in an alpha-halogenation reaction. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen an α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other side of the carbonyl group is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH), it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate (a cyclopropanone), followed by ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid (a carboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂). This is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). Pyridine is added to neutralize the HCl that is produced as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nCyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (an acid chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(Ot-Bu)₃). This is a mild reducing agent that is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes, preventing further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry. On the timescale of an NMR experiment at room temperature, the cyclopentane ring is rapidly interconverting between its various conformations, and there is free rotation around the bond connecting the ring to the aldehyde group. This results in an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the opposite carbon atom of the ring.\n\nLet's count the sets of equivalent protons:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 set, 1H)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton is attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde group. It is a unique methine proton. (1 set, 1H)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the CH₂ group at C2 equivalent to the CH₂ group at C5. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other (they are diastereotopic) because of their spatial relationship to the aldehyde substituent on C1. The same applies to C5. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 are divided into two distinct sets. (2 sets, 4H total)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes the CH₂ group at C3 equivalent to the CH₂ group at C4. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives two more distinct sets of protons. (2 sets, 4H total)\n\nIn total, adding up the sets: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1 H) + 2 (C2/C5 H's) + 2 (C3/C4 H's) = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
