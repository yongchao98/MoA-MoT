    "The series of reactions culminates in the formation of product E, which is identified as 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. The number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum is determined by the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**: Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT) to form a thioacetal, 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane. This step protects the aldehyde group.\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi), a strong base, deprotonates the acidic proton on the carbon atom situated between the two sulfur atoms.\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile, attacking bromoethane to form 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: The thioacetal protecting group is removed by hydrolysis using mercuric chloride, yielding the ketone 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This final step is a Wittig reaction. The ylide is prepared from 3-bromopentane (CH₃CH₂CH(Br)CH₂CH₃) and triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), which is then deprotonated by BuLi to form the Wittig reagent, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃. This ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone) to form the final product E.\n\nThe structure of the final product, E, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene:\n(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂\n\nTo determine the number of 13C-NMR signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. The molecule 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene is highly symmetrical. It has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the central carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nDue to this symmetry:\n*   The two sp² hybridized carbons of the double bond (C3 and C4) are chemically equivalent. This will produce one signal.\n*   The four ethyl groups attached to the double bond are all equivalent.\n*   Within each ethyl group, the methylene carbon (-CH₂-) and the methyl carbon (-CH₃) are in different chemical environments.\n*   Therefore, all four methylene carbons are equivalent to each other, resulting in a second signal.\n*   Similarly, all four methyl carbons are equivalent, producing a third signal.\n\nIn total, the molecule will exhibit 3 distinct signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
