    "Let's analyze the two reactions to determine the suitable reagents for 'A' and 'B'.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The process involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n\n*   Sodium cyanide (NaCN) serves as the source of the cyanide nucleophile.\n*   The reaction requires a proton source to protonate the intermediate alkoxide that forms after the cyanide attack. This is typically achieved by adding an acid. Reagent 'A' is therefore an acid.\n*   Commonly, this reaction is performed with NaCN or KCN and an acid like HCl, or by using hydrogen cyanide (HCN) directly. Using NaCN with an acid like H₃O⁺ generates HCN in situ and provides the necessary proton for the final step to form the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin.\n*   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺** is a suitable reagent. NaHSO₃ would lead to a different type of addition product and is incorrect.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n*   Hydrolysis of nitriles can be catalyzed by either acid or base upon heating.\n*   Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is typically performed by heating the nitrile with a strong acid, such as dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This process converts the nitrile into a carboxylic acid.\n*   The options for reagent 'B' are HCl (a strong acid) and CH₃COOH (a weak acid).\n*   For effective hydrolysis of a nitrile, a strong acid like **HCl** is generally required. Weak acids like acetic acid are typically not sufficient to promote this transformation efficiently.\n*   Thus, **B = HCl** is the appropriate reagent.\n\nCombining the findings for both reactions, reagent A should be H₃O⁺ and reagent B should be HCl.\n\n<<<A>>>"
