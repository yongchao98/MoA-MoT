    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### **1. Analysis of Gaseous Products**\nThe initial mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 g, completely decomposes into a mixture of gases upon heating. These gases are passed through a series of tubes, and the change in mass of each tube tells us about the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   From this, we can calculate the moles of hydrogen atoms: 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = **0.40 mol H**.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)**\n    *   The weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases, such as CO₂ or NO₂, were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper is a reactive metal that removes oxygen (O₂) from a gas mixture (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO). It can also react with nitrogen oxides like nitrous oxide (N₂O), reducing it to nitrogen gas (Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂).\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms captured by Cu = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = **0.05 mol O**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas)**\n    *   After the three tubes, 2.24 L of gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the previous reagents, which strongly suggests it is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This 0.10 mol of N₂ includes any N₂ produced directly from the decomposition and any N₂ formed from the reduction of N₂O in tube №3. Therefore, the total moles of nitrogen atoms in the gas mixture is 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = **0.20 mol N**.\n\n### **2. Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture**\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the gaseous products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture. Let's find the total moles of each element.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 0.40 mol\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 0.20 mol\n*   **Oxygen (O):** The total oxygen comes from the water and the oxygen captured by the copper. Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O captured by Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol O**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass: (0.40 mol H × 1.01 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.01 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.00 g/mol) = 0.404 g + 2.802 g + 4.00 g = 7.206 g. This matches the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### **3. Identifying Salts A and B**\nThe initial mixture consists only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. Since it's an \"equimolar mixture of salts\", we are looking for two ionic compounds made from these elements.\n*   The molar ratio of the elements in the combined mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives N₄H₈O₅.\n*   This formula, N₄H₈O₅, represents the combined chemical formula of one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B, because they are in an equimolar mixture.\n\nTo find the individual salts, we partition the atoms in N₄H₈O₅. The most common cation formed from nitrogen and hydrogen is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The eight hydrogen atoms (H₈) can form exactly two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺). This accounts for N₂ and H₈.\n\nThe remaining atoms, N₂O₅, must form the two anions for the salts, with a combined charge of -2. The most common oxyanions of nitrogen are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   Anion 1: **NO₃⁻** (nitrate)\n*   Anion 2: **NO₂⁻** (nitrite)\n\nCombining these anions and cations gives the two salts:\n*   **Salt A: NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium Nitrate)**\n*   **Salt B: NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium Nitrite)**\n\nThe decomposition reactions at 200°C are consistent with this identification:\n*   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\nThis reaction scheme perfectly matches the moles of products determined in step 1.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two identified salts.\n*   Number of atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n*   Number of atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
