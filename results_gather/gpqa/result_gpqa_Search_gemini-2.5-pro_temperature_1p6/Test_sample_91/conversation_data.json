    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation for the given compound.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe chemical formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's analyze the structure to count the number of atoms of each element.\n\n*   (CH3)2C= group: 1 C, plus 2 CH3 groups. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n*   =CH- group: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   -CH2- group: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   -CH(CH3)- group: 1 CH in the chain and 1 CH3 group. Total: 2 C, 4 H.\n*   -CH2- group: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   -CH= group: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   =C(CH3)2 group: 1 C, plus 2 CH3 groups. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Bonds**\n\nBased on the structure, we can count the different types of covalent bonds:\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:**\n    *   Bonds within the main 7-carbon chain: 4 (C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6).\n    *   Bonds from the main chain to methyl groups: 2 on the first carbon, 1 on the fourth, and 2 on the seventh. Total: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.\n    *   Total C-C single bonds = 4 + 5 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom)**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy required to break all of its bonds to form individual gaseous atoms.\nΔH_atom(compound) = (No. of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE_C-H)\nGiven bond energies:\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nCalculation:\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Constituent Elements**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f°) is the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe calculate this using a Hess's Law cycle involving the atomization of reactants and the formation of the product from its gaseous atoms. First, we find the energy needed to form the gaseous atoms (12 C(g) and 22 H(g)) from the elements in their standard states.\n\n*   **For Carbon:** The enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol.\n    Energy for 12 moles of C = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   **For Hydrogen:** The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy for H2(g) → 2H(g). Therefore, the energy to form one mole of H atoms is 100 kJ / 2 = 50 kJ/mol.\n    Energy for 22 moles of H = 22 mol × 50 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of elements = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the elements and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\nΔH_f° = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\nΔH_f° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Convert to the Required Units**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/mol or kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check against the options.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    M = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g:**\n    ΔH_f° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) = **11.4457... kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n*   **Option A) 11200 kJ/mol:** This is the calculated enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not the enthalpy of formation.\n*   **Option B) 11.44 kJ/g:** This matches our calculated enthalpy of formation expressed in kJ/g.\n*   **Option C) 67.4 kJ/mol:** This value is numerically close to the enthalpy of atomization per gram (11200 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 67.47 kJ/g), but the units are incorrect.\n*   **Option D) 1900 kJ/g:** This has the numerical value of the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol, but the wrong unit.\n\nThus, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
