    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we first need to find the mass dimensions of each component in the given Lagrangian term.\n\nThe Lagrangian is:\n`L_int = κ * ψ̄ * σ_μν * ψ * F^μν`\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action `S = ∫d⁴x L` is dimensionless. Since `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of [M]⁻⁴, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of [M]⁴.\n\nThe mass dimensions of the individual components are as follows:\n\n*   **Fermion fields (ψ and ψ̄):** The kinetic term for a fermion field is `ψ̄iγ^μ∂_μψ`. For this term to have a mass dimension of [M]⁴, we have `[ψ̄][ψ][∂_μ] = [M]⁴`. Since `[∂_μ] = [M]¹`, we get `[ψ]² = [M]³`, which means the mass dimension of a fermion field is `[ψ] = [M]^(3/2)`.\n*   **Field strength tensor (F^μν):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `-1/4 * F_μν * F^μν`. For this to have a mass dimension of [M]⁴, we need `[F^μν]² = [M]⁴`, so the mass dimension is `[F^μν] = [M]²`.\n*   **Sigma matrix (σ_μν):** This is defined as `(i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. The gamma matrices (γ_μ) are dimensionless matrices. Therefore, σ_μν is also dimensionless, i.e., `[σ_μν] = [M]⁰`.\n\nNow we can calculate the mass dimension of κ:\n`[L_int] = [κ][ψ̄][σ_μν][ψ][F^μν]`\n`[M]⁴ = [κ][M]^(3/2)[M]⁰[M]^(3/2)[M]²`\n`[M]⁴ = [κ][M]³[M]²`\n`[M]⁴ = [κ][M]⁵`\n`[κ] = [M]⁴ / [M]⁵ = [M]⁻¹`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\nNext, we determine if the theory is renormalizable. A theory is generally considered renormalizable by power-counting if all its coupling constants have a mass dimension that is greater than or equal to zero. If a coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable. This is because operators with negatively dimensioned coupling constants become more significant at high energies, leading to intractable divergences in loop calculations.\n\nSince `[κ] = -1`, which is negative, the theory described by this Lagrangian is not renormalizable.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   The mass dimension of κ is -1.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
