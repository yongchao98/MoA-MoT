    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal as the spotted star, we must first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the star's rotation and then equate it to the dimming caused by a planetary transit.\n\n### 1. Light Variation due to Starspots\n\nThe change in brightness is due to one hemisphere of the star being partially covered in cooler, dark spots. The maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, and the minimum brightness occurs when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n\nWe can model the flux based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where the energy flux (F) from a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (Teff), i.e., F ∝ T⁴.\n\n*   **Star's Effective Temperature (T_star):** 6000 K\n*   **Spot Temperature (T_spot):** 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   **Spot Filling Factor (f):** 20% or 0.20 (on one hemisphere)\n\n**Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's normal temperature.\n`F_max ∝ T_star⁴`\n\n**Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere is 20% covered by spots and 80% is unspotted photosphere.\n`F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n`F_min ∝ (0.80 * T_star⁴) + (0.20 * T_spot⁴)`\n\nThe amplitude of the light curve variation is the relative difference in flux:\n**Amplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max**\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\nAmplitude_spots = (T_star⁴ - [0.8 * T_star⁴ + 0.2 * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴\nAmplitude_spots = (0.2 * T_star⁴ - 0.2 * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴\n**Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)**\n\nNow, we plug in the temperature values:\nAmplitude_spots = 0.2 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude_spots = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude_spots = 0.2 * (1 - 0.48225)\nAmplitude_spots = 0.2 * 0.51775\n**Amplitude_spots ≈ 0.10355**\n\n### 2. Light Variation due to an Exoplanet Transit\n\nWhen a planet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the starlight, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this transit is determined by the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the planet to the cross-sectional area of the star.\n\n*   **Area_planet = π * R_pl²**\n*   **Area_star = π * R_star²**\n\nThe amplitude (or depth) of the transit signal is:\n**Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (R_pl / R_star)²**\n\n### 3. Equating the Amplitudes\n\nTo find the exoplanet size that mimics the starspot signal, we set the two amplitudes equal to each other:\nAmplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n**R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218**\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<D>>>"
