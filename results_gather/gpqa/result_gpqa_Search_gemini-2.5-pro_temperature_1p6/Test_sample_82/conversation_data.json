    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at the two specified points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (HA):**\n    Volume × Molarity = 0.0200 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 moles\n*   **New volume of the solution:**\n    20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid (Ca):**\n    Moles / New Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. Equivalence Point Volume\n\nNext, we determine the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point, where the moles of NaOH equal the initial moles of acetic acid.\n*   **Moles of acetic acid:** 0.001 moles\n*   **Volume of NaOH:**\n    Moles / Molarity = 0.001 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n### 3. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH has been added. This is a point in the buffer region, where both acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate) are present.\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:** 0.25 × 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³ = 0.0025 L\n*   **Moles of NaOH added:** 0.0025 L × 0.1 M = 0.00025 moles\n*   This amount of NaOH neutralizes an equal amount of acetic acid, forming 0.00025 moles of acetate (A⁻).\n*   **Moles of acetic acid remaining (HA):** 0.001 initial moles - 0.00025 moles = 0.00075 moles\n*   We use the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation** to find the pH.\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    Since the ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles, we have:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075) = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n    **pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26**\n\n### 4. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.\n*   **Moles of acetate (A⁻) formed:** 0.001 moles\n*   **Total volume of solution:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([A⁻]):** 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression to find the hydroxide concentration ([OH⁻]).\n    Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻] ≈ (x)(x) / 0.02\n*   **Solve for x = [OH⁻]:**\n    x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517\n    **pH at the equivalence point ≈ 8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>"
