    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, we can follow these steps based on the assumption that stars are uniformly distributed in space.\n\n### Derivation:\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Density:** The fundamental assumption is that the number density of stars, ρ (the number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere in space.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:** The total number of stars, *N*, within a spherical volume of radius *d* is given by the density multiplied by the volume of the sphere:\n    *   *N(d) = ρ × (4/3)πd³*\n\n3.  **Stars in a Spherical Shell:** We are interested in the number of stars, *dN*, within a thin spherical shell at a distance between *d* and *d + dd*. The volume of this shell, *dV*, is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    *   *dV = 4πd² dd*\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars in this shell is: *dN = ρ × dV = 4πρd² dd*\n\n4.  **Relating Distance to Parallax:** Stellar parallax (*plx*) is inversely proportional to the distance (*d*) to the star. The relationship is given by:\n    *   *d = 1/plx*\n\n5.  **Expressing the Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax:** To find how the number of stars changes with parallax, we must substitute *d* and *dd* in the equation for *dN* with expressions involving *plx*.\n    *   First, substitute *d = 1/plx* into the equation for *dN*.\n    *   Next, we need the differential *dd* in terms of *d(plx)*. We differentiate the distance-parallax relation:\n        *   *dd = d(1/plx) = -1/plx² d(plx)*\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting the number of stars in a given parallax range, we consider the magnitude: *|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)*.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Now, substitute both *d = 1/plx* and *dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)* into the equation for *dN*:\n    *   *dN = 4πρ (1/plx)² (1/plx²) d(plx)*\n    *   *dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)*\n\n7.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we look at the derivative *dN/d(plx)*:\n    *   *dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴*\n\nThis result shows that the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to 1/plx⁴. This relationship is a known concept in astronomy and is related to the Lutz-Kelker bias, which accounts for biases in parallax measurements when assuming a uniform distribution of stars.\n\n<<<B>>>"
