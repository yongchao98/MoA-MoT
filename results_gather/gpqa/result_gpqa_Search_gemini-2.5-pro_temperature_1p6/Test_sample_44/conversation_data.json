    "The energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by the formula:\nE_n = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2), where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nGiven that E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2), we can express the energy levels as E_n = n^2 * E.\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 fermions, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. However, each energy level 'n' can accommodate two particles with opposite spins (spin-up and spin-down).\n\n**Ground State:**\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   Two particles will occupy the n=1 energy level.\n*   The other two particles will occupy the n=2 energy level.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state (E_ground) is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\nE_ground = 2 * E_1 + 2 * E_2\nE_ground = 2 * (1^2 * E) + 2 * (2^2 * E)\nE_ground = 2 * E + 2 * (4 * E)\nE_ground = 2E + 8E\n**E_ground = 10E**\n\n**First Excited State:**\nTo get the first excited state, we move one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the next available empty energy level. In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2. The next available level is n=3. So, we move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   Two particles remain in the n=1 level.\n*   One particle remains in the n=2 level.\n*   One particle is in the n=3 level.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state (E_first_excited) is:\nE_first_excited = 2 * E_1 + 1 * E_2 + 1 * E_3\nE_first_excited = 2 * (1^2 * E) + 1 * (2^2 * E) + 1 * (3^2 * E)\nE_first_excited = 2 * E + 4 * E + 9 * E\n**E_first_excited = 15E**\n\n**Second Excited State:**\nThere are two ways to form the second excited state, and we need to find the one with the lower energy.\n*   **Possibility 1:** Move the remaining particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Two particles in n=1.\n    *   Zero particles in n=2.\n    *   Two particles in n=3.\n    *   E_second_excited_1 = 2 * E_1 + 2 * E_3 = 2 * (1^2 * E) + 2 * (3^2 * E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Move a particle from the n=2 level to the n=4 level (from the first excited state configuration).\n    *   Two particles in n=1.\n    *   One particle in n=2.\n    *   Zero particles in n=3.\n    *   One particle in n=4.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Move one particle from the first excited state configuration (from n=3 to n=4, which would be a higher excited state) or move a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Let's analyze the configuration with one particle from n=1 moved to n=3.\n    *   One particle in n=1.\n    *   Two particles in n=2.\n    *   One particle in n=3.\n    *   E = 1*E_1 + 2*E_2 + 1*E_3 = 1*E + 2*(4E) + 1*(9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E\n\nLet's re-examine the first excited state to ensure the next lowest energy transition for the second excited state. From the ground state (2 at n=1, 2 at n=2), the next single-particle excitation after moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 (which gave the first excited state) would be to move a particle from n=1 to n=3.\nLet's analyze the configuration for the second excited state as moving one of the particles from the ground state's n=2 level to the n=3 level (which defined the first excited state), and then moving the *other* particle from n=2 to n=3 as well is not the next lowest energy.\n\nThe correct way to determine the second excited state is to find the next possible arrangement of particles with the lowest total energy above the first excited state.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the configurations starting from the ground state (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2).\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 2*E₁ + 2*E₂ = 2(1²E) + 2(2²E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** The lowest energy excitation is to move one particle from n=2 to n=3. Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy = 2*E₁ + 1*E₂ + 1*E₃ = 2(1²E) + 1(2²E) + 1(3²E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** The next lowest energy excitation from the ground state involves either moving the second particle from n=2 to n=3 or moving one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Case A: Move the second particle from n=2 to n=3. Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Energy = 2*E₁ + 2*E₃ = 2(1²E) + 2(3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n    *   Case B: Move one particle from n=1 to n=3. Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy = 1*E₁ + 2*E₂ + 1*E₃ = 1(1²E) + 2(2²E) + 1(3²E) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nComparing the two possibilities, 18E is lower than 20E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is 18E.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<A>>>"
