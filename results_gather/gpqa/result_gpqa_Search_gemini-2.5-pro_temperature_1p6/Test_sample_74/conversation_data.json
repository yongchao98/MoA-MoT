You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus.

    "To determine why the protein is not being overexpressed, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed.\n\n1.  **Identify the Start and Tag Sequences**: The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the standard start codon for translation. Following this is the sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`. This translates to the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA, which is the correct sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. Therefore, the tag itself does not have a missense mutation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Subsequent Codons**: The sequence immediately following the HA tag is crucial. Let's break down the DNA sequence into codons starting from the beginning:\n    *   `ATG` (Start - Methionine)\n    *   `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC` (HA Tag: YPYDVPDYA)\n    *   `AAA` (Lysine)\n    *   `TGA` (...)\n\n3.  **Identify the Problematic Codon**: The codon `TGA` is one of the three standard stop codons (along with TAA and TAG) in the genetic code. When the ribosome encounters a stop codon in the messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence, it terminates translation, releasing the incomplete polypeptide chain.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Consequence**: In this construct, the `TGA` stop codon appears immediately after the codons for the HA tag and a single lysine residue. This means that instead of producing the full-length GADD45G protein with an N-terminal HA tag, the ribosome stops translation prematurely. The resulting product is only a very short peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K), which would not be detectable as the expected full-length protein on a Western blot or by other methods, explaining the observed lack of overexpression.\n\nConclusion: The genetic construct contains a premature stop codon (`TGA`) that causes the ribosome to fall off the mRNA transcript shortly after beginning translation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
