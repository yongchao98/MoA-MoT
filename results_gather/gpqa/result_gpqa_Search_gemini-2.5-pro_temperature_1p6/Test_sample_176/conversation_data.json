    "The search results confirm the physical principles needed to solve the problem.\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is given by the formula L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. This means luminosity is proportional to the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law states that the wavelength of peak emission (λ_max) for a black body is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). The formula is often written as λ_max * T = constant. Therefore, if two stars have the same wavelength of peak emission, they must have the same surface temperature.\n\nBased on this, my initial reasoning is correct.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio Formula:**\n    The ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 (L1) and Star 2 (L2) is:\n    L1 / L2 = (4πR1²σT1⁴) / (4πR2²σT2⁴)\n    L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:**\n    The problem states that the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2.\n    R1 = 1.5 * R2  =>  R1/R2 = 1.5\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:**\n    The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. According to Wien's Displacement Law, if λ_max1 = λ_max2, then their surface temperatures must be equal.\n    T1 = T2 => T1/T2 = 1\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 * 1\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25. The information regarding the mass and radial velocity of the stars is not relevant to this specific calculation which assumes the stars behave as ideal black bodies.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
