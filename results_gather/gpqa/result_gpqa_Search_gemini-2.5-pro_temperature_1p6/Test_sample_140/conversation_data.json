    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible products is determined by the different intermediates that can be formed and the ways they can react.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from one of the positions ortho to the bromine atom.\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen:** The amide ion can remove the hydrogen atom at the C6 position. Since the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), this is the faster and more probable pathway. This elimination leads to the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**, where the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium remains at C2.\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium:** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom at the C2 position. This process is slower but still occurs. This elimination pathway results in the formation of **benzyne** that has no deuterium, as it was removed in this step.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates:** The amide anion (or ammonia, the solvent) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n    *   **Reaction of 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Path A):** The nucleophile (NH₂) can attack either carbon of the benzyne triple bond.\n        *   Attack at C1 results in the formation of **2-deuterioaniline** (or *o*-deuterioaniline).\n        *   Attack at C6 results in the formation of **3-deuterioaniline** (or *m*-deuterioaniline).\n    *   **Reaction of Benzyne (from Path B):** The nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate. Since this intermediate is symmetrical, an attack on either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation: **aniline**.\n\nCombining the outcomes of both pathways, three distinct organic products are possible.\n\nThe possible products are:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-Deuterioaniline\n*   3-Deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
