    "The approach to solving this problem relies on the principle of conservation of energy, adapted for special relativity.\n\n### 1. Define Total Relativistic Energy\nIn a system with a potential energy U, the total energy E of a particle is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy and its potential energy. The kinetic energy is given by `(γ - 1)mc²`, where `m` is the rest mass, `c` is the speed of light, and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\nAn alternative, and often more useful, expression for the total energy of a particle is `E = γmc²`, which includes the rest energy `mc²`. If we include the potential energy of the system, the total conserved energy `E_sys` is:\n`E_sys = γmc² + U(x)`\n\nFor a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is `U(x) = (1/2)kx²`. So, the conserved total energy is:\n`E_sys = γmc² + (1/2)kx²`\n\n### 2. Apply Conservation of Energy\nThe total energy of the system remains constant throughout the oscillation. We can therefore equate the energy at two different points in the cycle: the point of maximum displacement and the point of maximum velocity.\n\n*   **At maximum displacement (x = A):** The mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity `v = 0`. This means the Lorentz factor `γ = 1`. The total energy at this point is:\n    `E_sys = (1)mc² + (1/2)kA² = mc² + (1/2)kA²`\n\n*   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):** The potential energy is zero (`U(0) = 0`). The speed is at its maximum, `v = v_max`, and the Lorentz factor is `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`. The total energy at this point is purely kinetic and rest energy:\n    `E_sys = γ_max * mc² + 0 = γ_max * mc²`\n\n### 3. Solve for Maximum Velocity (v_max)\nBy equating the total energy at these two points, we can solve for `v_max`:\n`γ_max * mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²`\n\nFirst, solve for `γ_max`:\n`γ_max = (mc² + (1/2)kA²) / mc²`\n`γ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\nNow, substitute the definition of `γ_max` back in:\n`1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\nNext, we solve algebraically for `v_max`:\n1.  Invert both sides:\n    `sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))`\n\n2.  Square both sides:\n    `1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n\n3.  Rearrange to solve for `v_max²/c²`:\n    `v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n\n4.  Finally, take the square root and multiply by `c`:\n    `v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²)`\n\nThis result matches option A precisely. The non-relativistic case can be recovered as a limit check: when `c` is very large, `v_max` approaches `sqrt(kA²/m)`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
