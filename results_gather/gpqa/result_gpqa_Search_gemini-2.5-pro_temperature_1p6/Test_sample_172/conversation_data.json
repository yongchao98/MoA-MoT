    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron.\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Uncertainty in the electron's position (Δx) = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   Speed of the electron (v) = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n2.  **Recall Fundamental Principles and Constants:**\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle states that it's impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle. The minimum uncertainty is given by the formula: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2.\n    *   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** Since the electron's speed (2 x 10⁸ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s), relativistic effects are important. The relationship between energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m₀) is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)².\n    *   **Reduced Planck's Constant (ħ):** Its value is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n3.  **Relate Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE) to Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\n    From the relativistic energy-momentum relation, we can find how a small change in momentum (Δp) affects the energy (ΔE). This is done by taking the derivative of energy with respect to momentum. The result of this derivation is that the change in energy is related to the change in momentum by the particle's velocity:\n    ΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\n    Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for the minimum uncertainty:\n    Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n    Δp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    Δp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE):**\n    Now, substitute the values of v and Δp into the relation from step 3:\n    ΔE = v * Δp\n    ΔE = (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    ΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    ΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value, ~1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J, is closest to the value given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
