    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a type of chemical reaction known as a-sigmatropic rearrangement, specifically a Cope rearrangement. This reaction is common for molecules called 1,5-dienes that are subjected to heat. The Cope rearrangement is a concerted process, meaning bonds are broken and formed in a single step through a cyclic, chair-like transition state.\n\nThe starting molecule, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, has the required structure for this reaction. The carbon chain backbone contains a segment from carbon 2 to carbon 7 (C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7) which constitutes the necessary 1,5-diene system for the rearrangement to occur.\n\nDuring the rearrangement:\n1.  The single bond between carbon 4 (C4) and carbon 5 (C5) breaks.\n2.  A new single bond forms between carbon 2 (C2) and carbon 7 (C7).\n3.  The double bonds shift their positions: the C2=C3 double bond moves to C3=C4, and the C6=C7 double bond moves to C5=C6.\n\nThe result is a new molecule with a rearranged carbon skeleton. To name this new molecule, we must first identify the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the new double bonds. This new main chain is ten carbons long (a decadiene). Following IUPAC nomenclature rules, we number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible positions, which are 1 and 5. The original parts of the molecule are now substituent groups on this new main chain: an ethyl group at position 4 and a methyl group at position 3.\n\nTherefore, the product formed is 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
