    "After a thorough review of the scientific and industrial literature concerning ethylene polymerization, the correctness of each statement can be assessed as follows:\n\n*   **A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\n    This statement is incorrect. While advanced dual-reactor or dual-catalyst systems exist to produce bimodal polyethylenes (polymers with two different molecular weight fractions), such as the Unipol II process, these do not typically function by generating the comonomer *in-situ* in a single reactor. The specific type of tandem catalysis, where one catalyst oligomerizes ethylene to α-olefins (like 1-hexene) and a second catalyst copolymerizes these *in-situ*, is a major field of research and development but is not described as a widespread, commercialized single-reactor process in the US.\n\n*   **B) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\n    This statement is technically correct but may not be the best description of the primary industrial approach. Noble metals such as palladium do exhibit catalytic activity for ethylene oligomerization and polymerization. However, due to their very high cost compared to base metals, they are generally not economically viable for the massive scale of polyethylene production. Industrial and research focus is heavily on more cost-effective metals like chromium, zirconium, titanium, iron, and nickel.\n\n*   **C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n    This statement is correct. Group VIa (Group 6) of the periodic table includes chromium (Cr). Chromium-based catalysts are of immense industrial importance. Specifically, the Chevron Phillips Chemical company developed and commercialized a process that uses a homogeneous chromium catalyst for the selective trimerization of ethylene into 1-hexene. This process manufactures the exact type of α-olefin needed to introduce regular branches in a polyethylene backbone. Research further confirms that various chromium complexes are highly effective for ethylene oligomerization to produce linear alpha-olefins. Therefore, a Group VIa metal catalyst is an excellent and industrially proven choice for the oligomerization step in a dual-catalyst system.\n\n*   **D) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\n    This statement is incorrect. The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene. The literature consistently shows that aluminum-based compounds, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), and various trialkylaluminum compounds, are essential activators (or cocatalysts) for the vast majority of oligomerization catalysts, including the chromium-based systems. Their role is to activate the transition metal complex to its catalytically active state.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate statement is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
