    "To determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism, we must identify which molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property often arises from the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as biphenyls. Substituted biphenyls can exhibit a form of chirality called atropisomerism. This occurs when there is a high enough energy barrier to rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings, allowing for the isolation of individual conformers. The bulky substituents (nitro and dicarboxylate groups) at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') of the biphenyl system cause significant steric hindrance, which restricts free rotation around the C-C single bond. This restricted rotation, combined with the substitution pattern, makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, resulting in axial chirality. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. To determine its potential for optical isomerism, we look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In this molecule, the second carbon atom is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃). Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and thus exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:** The chemical structure is (C₆H₅)₂CO. While individual molecules in a crystal lattice can be arranged in a chiral fashion, an individual benzophenone molecule is achiral in solution or gas phase because the phenyl rings can rotate freely. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry (specifically, a C2 rotational axis and two mirror planes) which make it superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a trans-isomer. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers and is achiral. Thus, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
