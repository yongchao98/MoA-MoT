    "The reaction between an enol and bromine is a well-established reaction in organic chemistry. The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, possesses a five-membered ring structure with an alcohol (-OH) group and a carbon-carbon double bond originating from the same carbon (C1), which is characteristic of an enol.\n\nThe key steps of the reaction are as follows:\n1.  **Electrophilic Attack**: The electron-rich double bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile and attacks an electrophilic bromine molecule (Br₂). This step is very rapid.\n2.  **Intermediate Formation**: This attack results in the formation of a resonance-stabilized intermediate, where a bromine atom bonds to the second carbon (C2) of the original double bond. The positive charge is delocalized between the C1 carbon and the oxygen atom.\n3.  **Deprotonation**: The intermediate, which can be viewed as a protonated ketone, then loses a proton (H+) from the oxygen atom.\n\nThis sequence of events results in the formation of an α-haloketone, where the hydroxyl group of the enol has been converted to a carbonyl group (ketone), and a bromine atom is attached to the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon).\n\nApplying this to 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol:\n*   The double bond is between C1 and C2, with the -OH group on C1.\n*   Bromine adds to C2.\n*   The C1-OH group becomes a ketone (C=O).\n*   The two methyl groups at C4 remain unchanged.\n\nThe final major product is therefore **2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n*   Options A and D, the dibromo-alcohols, would be the product of a different reaction pathway, simple addition, which is less favored than the rearrangement to the more stable keto form.\n*   Option C, 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, is incorrect as the halogenation occurs at the α-carbon, which was part of the enol's double bond, not at the C4 position.\n\n<<<B>>>"
