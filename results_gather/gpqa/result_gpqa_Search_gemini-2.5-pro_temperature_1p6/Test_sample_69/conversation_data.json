    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n1.  **Identify H, B, and D:** Reaction 4 states that gas B and gas D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. A well-known reaction fitting this description is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas:\n    CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l/g)\n    Phosgene (carbonyl chloride, COCl₂) is used as a solvent in some applications. Therefore, we can identify:\n    *   **B = CO** (Carbon Monoxide)\n    *   **D = Cl₂** (Chlorine)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene)\n\n2.  **Identify E:** Reaction 2 states that product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (Cl₂) to produce the \"extremely hazardous product E\". Phosgene (COCl₂) is well-documented as an extremely toxic and hazardous substance, responsible for many deaths when used as a chemical weapon in World War I. Given that H is phosgene, it is highly plausible that the extremely hazardous product E is also phosgene.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (Phosgene):**\n    *   **Chemical Formula:** COCl₂\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. The molecule is planar with a trigonal planar arrangement around the carbon atom.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   It has a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that runs along the C=O bond.\n        *   It has two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ). One plane contains all the atoms (the molecular plane), and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane, containing the C-O bond and bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n    *   **Point Group:** A molecule with a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n4.  **Consistency Check with Other Reactions (Optional):** Although the identities of A, C, F, and G are not required to find the symmetry of E, we can check for consistency.\n    *   **Reaction 1:** A(solid) + 8 CO(gas) → C(bright red). This describes the formation of a metal carbonyl complex. For instance, dicobalt octacarbonyl, Co₂(CO)₈, is a red-orange crystalline solid formed from cobalt and 8 equivalents of CO. So, A could be Co and C could be Co₂(CO)₈.\n    *   **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O → A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid). The hydrolysis of many complex compounds can be intricate. The exact identity of F and G would depend on the full reaction, but the problem's structure points towards E being identifiable without resolving this complex hydrolysis. The regeneration of A is a key feature of many catalytic or template-based syntheses.\n    *   **Reaction 2:** C + 2 Cl₂ → E. With C being Co₂(CO)₈, the reaction with chlorine would be Co₂(CO)₈ + 2Cl₂ → 2CoCl₂ + 8CO. This doesn't produce phosgene directly. However, the problem may be constructed such that E is related to the reactants B and D, rather than being a direct product of C. The most logical conclusion remains that E is phosgene based on the description.\n\nThe most direct path to the solution relies on identifying B, D, and H from reaction 4 and then identifying E based on its hazardous nature. The molecular symmetry of E (phosgene) is C₂ᵥ.\n\nA) C2v\n\n<<<A>>>"
