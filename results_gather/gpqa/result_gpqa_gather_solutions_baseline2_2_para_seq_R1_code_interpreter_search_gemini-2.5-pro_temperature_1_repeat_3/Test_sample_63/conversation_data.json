Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This rules out carbon-containing salts.\n\n*   **Gas Reacting with Tube №3 (hot Cu):** The mass of the copper-filled tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from a gaseous molecule in the mixture. Two plausible scenarios are that the gas was O₂ or N₂O. Both scenarios lead to the same elemental composition of the original salts. For simplicity, we can treat this as 0.05 moles of reactive oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nThe products (H₂O, O, and Gas C) must originate from the elements in salts A and B. By conservation of mass, we can determine the total mass and identity of Gas C.\n*   Total mass of known products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O) = 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g.\n*   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass of known products = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A stable, non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is Nitrogen (N₂).\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g sample:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O → 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂ → 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From H₂O and the reaction with Cu → 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. The problem states it's an equimolar mixture. This means that for one mole of salt A and one mole of salt B combined, the molar ratio of elements is N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n*   To find the simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20, which gives N:H:O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n*   So, the combined formula of one unit of A and one unit of B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nGiven that they are salts, a logical structure involves the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺).\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium cations (2 x NH₄⁺), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting this from the total gives the composition of the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   The two common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n*   Their combined formula is (NO₂) + (NO₃) = N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂**\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂) = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃) = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n*   Total number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products and Their Quantities:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)** absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)** shows no mass change, indicating that no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)** reacts with an oxidizing gas. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms bonding with the copper to form CuO.\n        *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms captured = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   **Gas C** is the unreactive gas remaining. The volume is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the Total Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts:**\n    By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass and elemental composition of the products must equal that of the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can use the product information to determine the composition of Gas C and the total elemental composition.\n    *   Total mass of known products (H₂O and the O that reacted) = 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial mass - mass of other products = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A common unreactive gas with this molar mass is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Therefore, the decomposition products are H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen source. The total elemental makeup of the 7.20g mixture is:\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol H₂O -> 2 × 0.20 = 0.40 mol H.\n        *   **Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol N₂ -> 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol N.\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol H₂O and the 0.05 mol of O atoms that reacted with Cu -> 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    The problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts (A and B). Let's determine the combined atomic formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B. The atomic ratio H:N:O is 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we multiply all by 20, yielding a ratio of H:N:O = 8:4:5.\n    *   Thus, the combined formula of (Salt A + Salt B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   The salts contain only N, H, and O and decompose into gases. This strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing anions. The presence of 8 hydrogen atoms is a key clue, fitting perfectly with two ammonium ions (2 x NH₄⁺), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈.\n    *   Subtracting the two ammonium ions from the total formula (N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈) leaves **N₂O₅** to be distributed between the two anions.\n    *   The two most common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Adding these two anions together gives N₂O₅, a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** Total atoms = (1+1) N + 4 H + 2 O = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** Total atoms = (1+1) N + 4 H + 3 O = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated total number of atoms is 17. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**1. Deconstruction and Analysis of the Experimental Data**\n\nThe problem involves a chemical decomposition and subsequent analysis of the products. We must systematically analyze each step to determine the identity of the original substances.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent. Its mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon (e.g., carbonates, oxalates) or sulfur (e.g., sulfites).\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This oxygen must have been delivered by an oxidizing gas from the decomposition mixture.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (Gas C) remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determining the Elemental Composition of the Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture. The products contain hydrogen, oxygen, and the element(s) in Gas C. We can find the mass of Gas C to identify it.\n\n*   The mass of the oxygen *source* (the gas that reacted in Tube 3) is a bit tricky. However, we can use an elemental balance, which is more robust. Let's find the total moles of each element in the initial mixture.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** Found exclusively in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n        Moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining common element that forms salts and an inert gas (N₂) is nitrogen. Let's verify this by mass.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Remaining mass for Nitrogen = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = 2.80 g.\n        *   Moles of N = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   The remaining Gas C had 0.10 mol. If it's N₂, it would contain 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol of N atoms, which matches our calculation. Therefore, Gas C is indeed N₂.\n\n**3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nWe need to find two salts, A and B, that in an equimolar mixture provide a total of 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. The ratio of atoms in one combined unit of (A+B) is N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. Multiplying by 20 to get integers gives an atomic ratio of **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe must now partition this total formula into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   The salts are composed of N, H, and O. The most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺).\n*   The 8 H atoms correspond exactly to two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n*   This suggests each salt, A and B, contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Subtracting the two ammonium ions from our total formula leaves the components for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   We need to split N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical partition is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculating the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., the sum of atoms in their individual chemical formulas).\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   The formula contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   The formula contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided solutions.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Experimental Data**\n\nThe first step is to correctly interpret the data from the sequential gas analysis.\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial negative result, indicating that no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed. This suggests the salts do not contain carbon.\n*   **Tube №3 (Hot Copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas (C) remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial salt mixture.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen. Let's verify this by checking the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.05 mol (from Cu tube) + (0.20 mol from H₂O) × 16.0 g/mol = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   This is consistent with the remaining gas C being 0.10 mol of N₂ (which contains 0.20 mol of N atoms).\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts contain N, H, and O and decompose into gases. This strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen acids. Since the mixture is equimolar, the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B has the atomic ratio:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nMultiplying by 20 to get the smallest integer ratio gives:\n**N₄H₈O₅**\n\nWe need to partition this formula into two plausible salt structures. The 8 H atoms strongly suggest two ammonium cations (2 × NH₄⁺), which account for N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   The remaining N₂O₅ must be distributed between the two anions. The most logical partition into common anions is the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻) and the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻), which together sum to N₂O₅.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms =** 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of Decomposition:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. The mass did not change, so no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced. This rules out carbon-containing salts.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms reacting with the copper to form CuO.\n        *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   This oxygen came from an oxidizing gas. There are two chemically plausible scenarios: the gas was O₂ (in which case 0.025 mol of O₂ reacted) or it was N₂O (in which case 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted). Both are consistent with the 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture:**\n    By the law of conservation of mass, we can determine the elemental makeup of the initial 7.20 g mixture from the products.\n    *   **Mass of Hydrogen (H):** from 0.20 mol H₂O. Moles of H = 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol. Mass ≈ 0.40 g.\n    *   **Mass of Oxygen (O):** from 0.20 mol H₂O and the 0.05 mol of O atoms that reacted with Cu. Moles of O = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol. Mass ≈ 4.00 g.\n    *   **Mass of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen. Mass of N = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g. Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   *Self-Consistency Check:* The 0.20 mol of nitrogen atoms corresponds to 0.10 mol of N₂ gas, which perfectly matches the amount of remaining gas C.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    The mixture is equimolar and contains H, N, and O atoms. We need to find two salt formulas that, when combined, contain a ratio of H:N:O atoms corresponding to our molar findings (0.40:0.20:0.25).\n    *   Multiplying the molar ratio by 20 gives a simple integer ratio of **H:N:O = 8:4:5**.\n    *   This H₈N₄O₅ represents the combined atoms of one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   Given they are salts made of H, N, and O, they are almost certainly ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoanions. The cation is NH₄⁺.\n    *   Two ammonium cations (one for each salt) have the combined formula N₂H₈. This perfectly accounts for all 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The remaining atoms, which must form the two anions, are: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n    *   The two most common nitrogen oxoanions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).

A mass conservation check confirms the identity of Gas C.\n    *   Total Mass of salts = 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g. The gas that contained this oxygen (e.g., O₂) had a mass of at least 0.80 g.\n    *   Let's calculate the total mass of each element from the products.\n        *   Total moles of Hydrogen (H) = Moles(H₂O) × 2 = 0.20 mol × 2 = 0.40 mol.\n        *   Total moles of Oxygen (O) = Moles(O in H₂O) + Moles(O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   The remaining mass must be the element in Gas C: Mass = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n        *   Since we have 0.10 mol of Gas C, its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol. The most common gas with this molar mass produced from salt decomposition is nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   Total moles of Nitrogen (N) = Moles(N₂) × 2 = 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol. (This is consistent with the mass: 0.20 mol * 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g).\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts A and B:**\n    The original 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n    *   The combined atomic formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B has a molar ratio of N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   Multiplying by 20 to get integers gives the ratio N:H:O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n    *   The combined formula is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   Since these are salts made of N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n    *   Subtracting the cations leaves the atoms for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n    *   This N₂O₅ must be split between the two anions. The most common and stable nitrogen oxyanions are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   The sum of these two anions is (NO₂⁻) + (NO₃⁻) = N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt combined.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula N₂H₄O₂. Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula N₂H₄O₃. Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total Atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Option:**\n    The calculated total number of atoms is 17. Matching this with the provided options:\n    A) 15\n    B) 19\n    C) 17\n    D) 13\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Experimental Products**\n\nFirst, we identify the chemical products and their quantities from the experimental data provided.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. The mass did not change, which means **no acidic gases** (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out carbon-containing salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This oxygen likely came from O₂ gas or N₂O gas, both of which are produced in the decomposition of ammonium salts.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of a gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products (H, O, and the element in Gas C) must have come from the original 7.20 g salt mixture. We can identify Gas C by checking if the total mass of products matches the initial mass. Assuming the inert Gas C is nitrogen (N₂), which is common in such decompositions:\n\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   The mass of the substance that delivered the oxygen to the copper was 0.80 g. If the substance was O₂, its mass was 0.80 g.\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total Product Mass = 3.60 g (H₂O) + 0.80 g (oxygen-source) + 2.80 g (N₂) = 7.20 g.\n\nThis matches the initial mass exactly. Thus, the products are H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen source, and the original salts are composed only of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nNow, let's find the total moles of each element in the initial mixture:\n*   **Total Moles of H:** from 0.20 mol H₂O → 2 × 0.20 = **0.40 mol H**\n*   **Total Moles of N:** from 0.10 mol N₂ → 2 × 0.10 = **0.20 mol N**\n*   **Total Moles of O:** from 0.20 mol H₂O + 0.05 mol O atoms reacted with Cu → 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**\n\n**3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains the same number of moles of salt A and salt B. The overall atomic molar ratio in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get the simplest integer ratio for the combined formula of one unit of A and one unit of B, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince A and B are salts made of N, H, and O, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions. The ammonium ion is NH₄⁺.\n*   The presence of 8 Hydrogen atoms in the combined formula strongly suggests there are two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This would mean each salt formula contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Let's subtract the atoms from the two ammonium ions from our combined formula:\n    N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅\n*   This remaining N₂O₅ represents the atoms in the two anions combined. The most common and stable nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   Checking if they sum to N₂O₅:\n    (NO₃⁻) + (NO₂⁻) = N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n**4. Calculating the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    Total Atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    Total Atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis value corresponds to option A. Many of the provided candidate answers performed the correct calculation to get 17 but made typographical errors in selecting the final letter. The chemical reasoning across all sound methods converges to the same result.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided reasoning.\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Product Identification**\nThe first step is to analyze the information from the three tubes to identify the gaseous products of the decomposition.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube's weight did not change, indicating that no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is equal to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** 2.24 liters of an unreactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   A quick check using conservation of mass [Mass(C) = 7.20g (total) - 3.60g (H₂O) - 0.80g (O atoms) = 2.80g] shows that Gas C has a molar mass of 2.80g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol. This identifies Gas C as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determining the Composition of the Initial Salts**\nBy using the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts.\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** from 0.20 mol of H₂O => 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** from 0.10 mol of N₂ => 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** from H₂O and the reaction with Cu => 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe total elemental ratio in the combined equimolar mixture (one formula unit of A + one of B) is N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25. Multiplying by 20 to get integers gives the ratio **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n**3. Identifying Salts A and B**\nWe need to find two salts containing N, H, and O that combine to this formula. The presence of 8 H atoms strongly suggests two ammonium ions (2 x NH₄⁺), which together have the formula N₂H₈. Subtracting this from the total gives the composition of the two anions:\nN₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\nThe two most common nitrogen-oxygen anions that sum to N₂O₅ are the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻) and the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻).\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n**4. Answering the Question**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of each.\n*   Number of atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂) = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n*   Number of atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃) = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n*   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided solutions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products**\nThe first step is to deduce the identity and quantity of the gaseous products from the experimental results. This process is consistent across all successful analyses.\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass gain of 3.60 g corresponds to H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** The mass did not change, meaning no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced. This rules out salts containing carbon.\n*   **Tube №3 (Hot Copper):** This tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to reacting with an oxidizing gas and forming CuO. The mass increase is equal to the mass of oxygen atoms transferred.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining 2.24 L of gas at STP corresponds to:\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the Full Composition of the Gas Mixture**\nBy conservation of mass, the total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n*   The 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms could have come from either O₂ gas (0.025 mol, mass 0.80 g) or a gas like N₂O (0.05 mol, mass 2.20 g, providing 0.80 g of O). A simple mass balance check helps identify Gas C and clarifies the oxidizing gas.\n*   Mass of products identified so far = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(Oxygen source).\n*   Remaining Mass = Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O in oxidizing gas) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   This molar mass, along with its inertness, strongly identifies Gas C as **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n*   With N₂ identified, the oxygen source must have been **O₂** gas (mass = moles * M = 0.025 * 32 = 0.80 g), not N₂O. This creates a consistent mass balance.\n*   The decomposition products are: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.10 mol N₂, and 0.025 mol O₂.**\n\n**3. Identify the Salts A and B**\nThe original salts contained only Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. We need to find two equimolar salts that decompose to produce the determined amounts of gases. Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) are the prime candidates.\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n*   `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)`\n\nLet `n` be the number of moles of each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: we get `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the coefficients from the balanced equation): we get `n` mol N₂, `0.5n` mol O₂, and `2n` mol H₂O.\n\nSumming the products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nWe can solve for `n` by comparing this with our experimental results:\n*   Using O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**.\n\nWe can verify this with the other products:\n*   Predicted N₂: `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches).\n*   Predicted H₂O: `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches).\nThe salts are indeed **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) ** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n*   **Atoms in NH₄NO₂:** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in NH₄NO₃:** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis result matches the calculations performed by the vast majority of the provided answers.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe logical steps, confirmed by multiple analyses, consistently lead to the result of 17 atoms. This corresponds to option B. Several of the candidate answers made a clerical error by selecting the wrong letter after performing the correct calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the products of thermal decomposition to deduce the identity of the original salts. Let's break down the process step-by-step, following the logic presented by the most accurate candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n1.  **Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products and Their Quantities**\n    The gaseous products are analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes:\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a test for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its mass did not change, no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's mass increases by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to oxygen atoms bonding to the copper.\n        *   Molar Mass of an Oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n        *   This oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas. A common one is O₂. If the gas was O₂, the reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The moles of O₂ gas would be 0.05 mol O / 2 = 0.025 mol. Another possibility is N₂O reacting via N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO, which would mean 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted. As we will see, both possibilities lead to the same elemental composition.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** 2.24 L of a gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n2.  **Verify the Product Identities and Determine Elemental Composition**\n    Let's assume Gas C is Nitrogen (N₂), a common, inert product from decomposing nitrogenous salts. We can check if the total mass of the products (assuming the oxidizing gas was O₂) equals the initial mass.\n    *   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol × 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Total Mass = 2.80 g + 0.80 g + 3.60 g = **7.20 g**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the initial mass, confirming that the products are indeed 0.10 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.20 mol H₂O.\n\n    Now, let's find the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture:\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** 2 × moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol H**\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** 2 × moles(N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol N**\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** (2 × moles(O₂)) + (1 × moles(H₂O)) = (2 × 0.025 mol) + 0.20 mol = 0.05 + 0.20 = **0.25 mol O**\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n    We have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, which must contain N, H, and O.\n    *   The combined atomic ratio of (A + B) is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To find the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives N:H:O = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n    *   This means one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B together contain N₄H₈O₅.\n    *   The presence of H, N, and O in salts suggests ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The 8 Hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two NH₄⁺ ions (2 × N¹H⁴⁺ = N₂H₈).\n    *   The remaining atoms, which must form the two anions, are N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n    *   The two most common nitrogen oxyanions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Checking their sum: NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ = N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n    The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt combined.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**Analysis of the Provided Solutions**\n\n1.  **Deconstruction of the Problem:** All provided answers correctly deconstruct the experimental setup.\n    *   **Tube 1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** Absorbs H₂O. Mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   **Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂):** Absorbs acidic gases. No mass change means no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n    *   **Tube 3 (Red-hot Cu):** Reacts with an oxidizing gas. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted to form CuO. This corresponds to 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining 2.24 L at STP corresponds to 0.10 mol of an inert gas.\n\n2.  **Identification of Products:** By checking the law of conservation of mass, all solutions correctly identify the final unreacted gas (Gas C) as nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Mass H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of reacted Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g (total) - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol, which is N₂.\n    *   So, the total products of the decomposition contain all the atoms from 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.10 mol N₂, and the 0.80 g (0.05 mol) of oxygen atoms that reacted with copper.\n\n3.  **Determination of Elemental Composition:** All solutions correctly deduce that the initial 7.20 g mixture was composed solely of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. They calculate the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n    *   Moles of H = 2 * (moles of H₂O) = 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol\n    *   Moles of N = 2 * (moles of N₂) = 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol\n    *   Moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol\n\n4.  **Identification of Salts A and B:** All solutions correctly reason that since the mixture is equimolar, the combined chemical formula for one unit of Salt A and one unit of Salt B must have the elemental ratio N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25, which simplifies to an integer ratio of N₄H₈O₅. By reasoning that the salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions, all solutions correctly identify the salts as Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   NH₄NO₂ (N₂H₄O₂) + NH₄NO₃ (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** This is the last and most critical step. The question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll fifteen candidate answers, despite some minor differences in the description of the decomposition reactions, correctly deduce that the salts are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate. Furthermore, every single one of them correctly calculates the total number of atoms in these two salts to be 17.\n\nThe discrepancies in the final answers (e.g., some choosing <<<A>>> or <<<C>>>) appear to be clerical errors in matching the calculated result of **17** with the given options. The correct option corresponding to the number 17 is **B**. The chemical reasoning is universally sound and points to this single value.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 19\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 15\n\nThe calculated value is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Identification of Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem involves analyzing the gases produced by heating a salt mixture. Each tube in the experimental setup isolates a component of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a desiccant, which absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This is a critical piece of information, indicating that **no acidic gases were formed**. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon that would form acidic oxides upon decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. The formation of CuO means it reacted with a gas containing oxygen. The mass increase of the tube corresponds to the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) reacted = 0.80 g.\n    *   The atomic mass of O is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The gas that passed through all tubes without reacting.\n    *   Volume at standard temperature and pressure (STP) = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B. We can determine the total moles of each element in the original mixture.\n\n*   All nitrogen in the system ends up in the final inert Gas C (as N₂).\n*   All hydrogen ends up in the absorbed H₂O.\n*   All oxygen ends up in the absorbed H₂O and the CuO.\n\nLet's calculate the total moles of each element:\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** From the H₂O and the reacted O.\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol (from H₂O) + 0.05 mol (from reaction with Cu) = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All the initial N is present in the final unreacted gas. The most logical identity for this inert gas is N₂.\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass:\nMass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\nMass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the salts are composed of N, H, and O and that the mixture is equimolar. Let's find the empirical formula for the combination of one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B. The ratio of the elements is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo convert this to the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.05) or multiply by 20.\nN : H : O = (0.20/0.05) : (0.40/0.05) : (0.25/0.05) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nThe combined formula of (Salt A + Salt B) is N₄H₈O₅. Since they are salts containing N and H, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n\nSubtracting the cations from the total formula gives us the composition of the anions:\nN₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n\nThe two anions together must have the formula N₂O₅. The most common and logical nitrogen oxyanions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's see if they fit:\nAnion 1 (NO₂⁻) + Anion 2 (NO₃⁻) = N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen: 2\n    *   Hydrogen: 4\n    *   Oxygen: 2\n    *   Total in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen: 2\n    *   Hydrogen: 4\n    *   Oxygen: 3\n    *   Total in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem and Identification of Products**\n\nThe core of the problem is to identify salts A and B by analyzing their gaseous decomposition products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, meaning **no acidic gases** were formed. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: Hot copper acts as a reducing agent, reacting with oxidizing gases. The formation of CuO means an oxygen-containing gas reacted. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxygen-donating gas in the mixture (like O₂ or N₂O).\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C)**: After the previous steps, 2.24 L of a gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the reagents used.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of Elemental Composition**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture of salts must contain the elements found in the products. Let's find the total moles and mass of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen is present in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N)**: The only remaining element must be nitrogen. We can verify this using the principle of mass conservation. The mass of the unreacted gas C must be the total mass minus the mass of H₂O and the mass of oxygen that reacted with copper.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g (total) - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass corresponds to nitrogen gas (N₂).\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O, and they decompose into gases. This strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions. Since the mixture is equimolar, one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B must together contain atoms in the same ratio as the moles we found: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we multiply by 20:\n**N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is N₄H₈O₅. We need to split this into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), as 2 × 4 = 8. This suggests each salt contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Two NH₄⁺ ions account for N₂H₈.\n*   The remaining atoms for the two anions are: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   The two most common nitrogen-oxygen anions that add up to N₂O₅ are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n*   Thus, the two salts must be **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) ** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂, or N₂H₄O₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃, or N₂H₄O₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a systematic breakdown of the problem to determine the correct answer. The analysis will proceed by first identifying the products of the reaction, then determining the composition of the original salts, and finally calculating the total number of atoms.\n\n**1. Identify and Quantify the Decomposition Products**\n\nThe gas mixture produced by heating the salts is analyzed by passing it through three tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a test for acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the tube's weight did not change, **no acidic gases were produced**. This indicates the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The tube contains copper, which becomes oxidized to copper oxide (CuO). The mass increase of the solid in the tube is due to the oxygen atoms that bond with the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms reacted = 0.80 g.\n    *   The atomic mass of an oxygen atom (O) is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**. This oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas like O₂ or N₂O.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** The gas that passed through all tubes without reacting.\n    *   Volume at standard temperature and pressure (STP) = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the mass and atoms in the products must equal the mass and atoms in the reactants. The products contain hydrogen, oxygen, and the element(s) from Gas C.\n\n*   First, we identify Gas C. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(Oxygen reacted) + Mass(Gas C) = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C). This doesn't seem right. The mass increase of tube 3 *is* the mass of oxygen atoms, but those atoms came from a gas that had its own mass. A better way is to find the mass of N, H, and O in the total mixture.\n    *   Total moles of **H** atoms = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol H**.\n    *   Total moles of **O** atoms = Moles(O in H₂O) + Moles(O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol O**.\n    *   Mass of H and O = (0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol) = 0.4 g + 4.0 g = 4.4 g.\n    *   The remaining mass in the initial 7.20 g mixture must be the third element.\n    *   Mass of unknown element = 7.20 g - 4.4 g = 2.8 g.\n    *   The inert Gas C (0.10 mol) is the only component left, so it must be composed of this unknown element. Its molar mass is 2.8 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol. This corresponds to nitrogen gas (**N₂**).\n    *   Therefore, the unknown element is Nitrogen (N).\n    *   Total moles of **N** atoms = 2.8 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol N**.\n\n**3. Identify the Chemical Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial equimolar mixture contained a total of 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. Since it is an equimolar mixture, let's consider the composition of one formula unit of Salt A plus one formula unit of Salt B. The atomic ratio must be:\n*   N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n*   To obtain simple integers, we multiply the ratio by 20:\n*   N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. The cation is almost certainly the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two NH₄⁺ ions, which would also account for 2 of the 4 nitrogen atoms.\n\n*   Subtracting two NH₄⁺ ions (N₂H₈) from the total formula (N₄H₈O₅) leaves **N₂O₅** for the two anions.\n*   The most logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is:\n    *   Nitrate (NO₃⁻)\n    *   Nitrite (NO₂⁻)\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products from the Gas Analysis Tubes:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its mass did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates that the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is an oxygen scavenger. It forms CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This oxygen was supplied by an oxidizing gas in the mixture.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture:**\n    By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g). The products are H₂O, some form of oxygen-containing gas, and Gas C. Based on the elements present, Gas C is most likely nitrogen (N₂). Let's verify this by checking the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H atoms = 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) × 1.0 g/mol H = 0.40 g H.\n    *   Mass of O atoms = (0.20 mol O from H₂O + 0.05 mol O from Cu tube) × 16.0 g/mol O = 4.00 g O.\n    *   Mass of Nitrogen (N) = Total mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g N.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol N.\n    *   The 0.10 mol of remaining Gas C would contain 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol of N atoms if it is N₂, which perfectly matches our calculation.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B containing a total of 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n    Let's find the elemental ratio for one formula unit of A plus one formula unit of B (A+B):\n    *   N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n    To convert this to a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value, 0.05 (or multiply the whole ratio by 20):\n    *   N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n    The combined chemical formula for (A+B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\n    Since the initial substances are salts made of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms in our combined formula correspond exactly to two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺).\n    *   Let's subtract the atoms from two NH₄⁺ ions (which is N₂H₈) from our total formula:\n    *   N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅\n    The remaining N₂O₅ must constitute the two anions for salts A and B. The most common and chemically stable nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Adding these two anions together: NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ gives a total elemental count of N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\n    Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    The final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n        *   Number of atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n        *   Number of atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n\n    The total number of atoms is the sum of the atoms in both salts:\n    *   Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Experimental Data to Identify Products and Quantities**\n\nThe problem requires a systematic analysis of the decomposition products to determine the identity of the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, it means **no acidic gases** were formed. This suggests the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is entirely from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 liters of a gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture. We can use the product analysis to find the total moles of each element present.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identification of the Third Element:** We can find the mass of the remaining element by subtracting the masses of hydrogen and oxygen from the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g of mass belongs to the 0.10 mol of inert Gas C. Therefore, the molar mass of Gas C is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28 g/mol**. The only common, stable gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is nitrogen (N₂).\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):**\n    *   Total moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial mixture was equimolar and contained 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. The combined atomic ratio for one formula unit of Salt A and one of Salt B must be N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25. To simplify this to whole numbers, we can multiply by 20, yielding an atomic ratio of **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to partition this combined formula into two plausible salt structures. Since the salts contain N, H, and O, they are very likely ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions.\n\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This suggests that each salt contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Subtracting the two ammonium cations from the total formula leaves the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The most logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common anions is into the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)** and the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)**, as their sum (NO₃ + NO₂) is N₂O₅.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This rules out carbon-containing salts.\n\n*   **Gas Reacting with Tube №3 (hot Cu):** The mass of the copper-filled tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from a gaseous molecule in the mixture. Two plausible scenarios are that the gas was O₂ or N₂O. Both scenarios lead to the same elemental composition of the original salts. For simplicity, we can treat this as 0.05 moles of reactive oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nThe products (H₂O, O, and Gas C) must originate from the elements in salts A and B. By conservation of mass, we can determine the total mass and identity of Gas C.\n*   Total mass of known products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O) = 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g.\n*   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass of known products = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A stable, non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is Nitrogen (N₂).\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g sample:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O → 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂ → 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From H₂O and the reaction with Cu → 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. The problem states it's an equimolar mixture. This means that for one mole of salt A and one mole of salt B combined, the molar ratio of elements is N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n*   To find the simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20, which gives N:H:O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n*   So, the combined formula of one unit of A and one unit of B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nGiven that they are salts, a logical structure involves the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺).\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium cations (2 x NH₄⁺), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting this from the total gives the composition of the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   The two common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n*   Their combined formula is (NO₂) + (NO₃) = N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂**\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂) = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃) = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n*   Total number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products and Their Quantities:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)** absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)** shows no mass change, indicating that no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)** reacts with an oxidizing gas. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms bonding with the copper to form CuO.\n        *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms captured = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   **Gas C** is the unreactive gas remaining. The volume is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the Total Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts:**\n    By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass and elemental composition of the products must equal that of the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can use the product information to determine the composition of Gas C and the total elemental composition.\n    *   Total mass of known products (H₂O and the O that reacted) = 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial mass - mass of other products = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A common unreactive gas with this molar mass is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Therefore, the decomposition products are H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen source. The total elemental makeup of the 7.20g mixture is:\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol H₂O -> 2 × 0.20 = 0.40 mol H.\n        *   **Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol N₂ -> 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol N.\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol H₂O and the 0.05 mol of O atoms that reacted with Cu -> 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    The problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts (A and B). Let's determine the combined atomic formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B. The atomic ratio H:N:O is 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we multiply all by 20, yielding a ratio of H:N:O = 8:4:5.\n    *   Thus, the combined formula of (Salt A + Salt B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   The salts contain only N, H, and O and decompose into gases. This strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing anions. The presence of 8 hydrogen atoms is a key clue, fitting perfectly with two ammonium ions (2 x NH₄⁺), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈.\n    *   Subtracting the two ammonium ions from the total formula (N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈) leaves **N₂O₅** to be distributed between the two anions.\n    *   The two most common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Adding these two anions together gives N₂O₅, a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** Total atoms = (1+1) N + 4 H + 2 O = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** Total atoms = (1+1) N + 4 H + 3 O = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated total number of atoms is 17. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**1. Deconstruction and Analysis of the Experimental Data**\n\nThe problem involves a chemical decomposition and subsequent analysis of the products. We must systematically analyze each step to determine the identity of the original substances.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent. Its mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon (e.g., carbonates, oxalates) or sulfur (e.g., sulfites).\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This oxygen must have been delivered by an oxidizing gas from the decomposition mixture.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (Gas C) remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determining the Elemental Composition of the Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture. The products contain hydrogen, oxygen, and the element(s) in Gas C. We can find the mass of Gas C to identify it.\n\n*   The mass of the oxygen *source* (the gas that reacted in Tube 3) is a bit tricky. However, we can use an elemental balance, which is more robust. Let's find the total moles of each element in the initial mixture.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** Found exclusively in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n        Moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining common element that forms salts and an inert gas (N₂) is nitrogen. Let's verify this by mass.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Remaining mass for Nitrogen = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = 2.80 g.\n        *   Moles of N = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   The remaining Gas C had 0.10 mol. If it's N₂, it would contain 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol of N atoms, which matches our calculation. Therefore, Gas C is indeed N₂.\n\n**3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nWe need to find two salts, A and B, that in an equimolar mixture provide a total of 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. The ratio of atoms in one combined unit of (A+B) is N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. Multiplying by 20 to get integers gives an atomic ratio of **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe must now partition this total formula into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   The salts are composed of N, H, and O. The most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺).\n*   The 8 H atoms correspond exactly to two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n*   This suggests each salt, A and B, contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Subtracting the two ammonium ions from our total formula leaves the components for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   We need to split N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical partition is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculating the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., the sum of atoms in their individual chemical formulas).\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   The formula contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   The formula contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided solutions.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Experimental Data**\n\nThe first step is to correctly interpret the data from the sequential gas analysis.\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial negative result, indicating that no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed. This suggests the salts do not contain carbon.\n*   **Tube №3 (Hot Copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas (C) remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial salt mixture.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen. Let's verify this by checking the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.05 mol (from Cu tube) + (0.20 mol from H₂O) × 16.0 g/mol = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   This is consistent with the remaining gas C being 0.10 mol of N₂ (which contains 0.20 mol of N atoms).\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts contain N, H, and O and decompose into gases. This strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen acids. Since the mixture is equimolar, the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B has the atomic ratio:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nMultiplying by 20 to get the smallest integer ratio gives:\n**N₄H₈O₅**\n\nWe need to partition this formula into two plausible salt structures. The 8 H atoms strongly suggest two ammonium cations (2 × NH₄⁺), which account for N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   The remaining N₂O₅ must be distributed between the two anions. The most logical partition into common anions is the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻) and the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻), which together sum to N₂O₅.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms =** 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of Decomposition:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. The mass did not change, so no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced. This rules out carbon-containing salts.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms reacting with the copper to form CuO.\n        *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   This oxygen came from an oxidizing gas. There are two chemically plausible scenarios: the gas was O₂ (in which case 0.025 mol of O₂ reacted) or it was N₂O (in which case 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted). Both are consistent with the 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture:**\n    By the law of conservation of mass, we can determine the elemental makeup of the initial 7.20 g mixture from the products.\n    *   **Mass of Hydrogen (H):** from 0.20 mol H₂O. Moles of H = 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol. Mass ≈ 0.40 g.\n    *   **Mass of Oxygen (O):** from 0.20 mol H₂O and the 0.05 mol of O atoms that reacted with Cu. Moles of O = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol. Mass ≈ 4.00 g.\n    *   **Mass of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen. Mass of N = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g. Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   *Self-Consistency Check:* The 0.20 mol of nitrogen atoms corresponds to 0.10 mol of N₂ gas, which perfectly matches the amount of remaining gas C.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    The mixture is equimolar and contains H, N, and O atoms. We need to find two salt formulas that, when combined, contain a ratio of H:N:O atoms corresponding to our molar findings (0.40:0.20:0.25).\n    *   Multiplying the molar ratio by 20 gives a simple integer ratio of **H:N:O = 8:4:5**.\n    *   This H₈N₄O₅ represents the combined atoms of one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   Given they are salts made of H, N, and O, they are almost certainly ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoanions. The cation is NH₄⁺.\n    *   Two ammonium cations (one for each salt) have the combined formula N₂H₈. This perfectly accounts for all 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The remaining atoms, which must form the two anions, are: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n    *   The two most common nitrogen oxoanions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).

A mass conservation check confirms the identity of Gas C.\n    *   Total Mass of salts = 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g. The gas that contained this oxygen (e.g., O₂) had a mass of at least 0.80 g.\n    *   Let's calculate the total mass of each element from the products.\n        *   Total moles of Hydrogen (H) = Moles(H₂O) × 2 = 0.20 mol × 2 = 0.40 mol.\n        *   Total moles of Oxygen (O) = Moles(O in H₂O) + Moles(O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   The remaining mass must be the element in Gas C: Mass = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n        *   Since we have 0.10 mol of Gas C, its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol. The most common gas with this molar mass produced from salt decomposition is nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   Total moles of Nitrogen (N) = Moles(N₂) × 2 = 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol. (This is consistent with the mass: 0.20 mol * 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g).\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts A and B:**\n    The original 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n    *   The combined atomic formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B has a molar ratio of N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   Multiplying by 20 to get integers gives the ratio N:H:O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n    *   The combined formula is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   Since these are salts made of N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n    *   Subtracting the cations leaves the atoms for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n    *   This N₂O₅ must be split between the two anions. The most common and stable nitrogen oxyanions are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   The sum of these two anions is (NO₂⁻) + (NO₃⁻) = N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt combined.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula N₂H₄O₂. Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula N₂H₄O₃. Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total Atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Option:**\n    The calculated total number of atoms is 17. Matching this with the provided options:\n    A) 15\n    B) 19\n    C) 17\n    D) 13\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Experimental Products**\n\nFirst, we identify the chemical products and their quantities from the experimental data provided.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. The mass did not change, which means **no acidic gases** (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out carbon-containing salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This oxygen likely came from O₂ gas or N₂O gas, both of which are produced in the decomposition of ammonium salts.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of a gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products (H, O, and the element in Gas C) must have come from the original 7.20 g salt mixture. We can identify Gas C by checking if the total mass of products matches the initial mass. Assuming the inert Gas C is nitrogen (N₂), which is common in such decompositions:\n\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   The mass of the substance that delivered the oxygen to the copper was 0.80 g. If the substance was O₂, its mass was 0.80 g.\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total Product Mass = 3.60 g (H₂O) + 0.80 g (oxygen-source) + 2.80 g (N₂) = 7.20 g.\n\nThis matches the initial mass exactly. Thus, the products are H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen source, and the original salts are composed only of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nNow, let's find the total moles of each element in the initial mixture:\n*   **Total Moles of H:** from 0.20 mol H₂O → 2 × 0.20 = **0.40 mol H**\n*   **Total Moles of N:** from 0.10 mol N₂ → 2 × 0.10 = **0.20 mol N**\n*   **Total Moles of O:** from 0.20 mol H₂O + 0.05 mol O atoms reacted with Cu → 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**\n\n**3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains the same number of moles of salt A and salt B. The overall atomic molar ratio in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get the simplest integer ratio for the combined formula of one unit of A and one unit of B, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince A and B are salts made of N, H, and O, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions. The ammonium ion is NH₄⁺.\n*   The presence of 8 Hydrogen atoms in the combined formula strongly suggests there are two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This would mean each salt formula contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Let's subtract the atoms from the two ammonium ions from our combined formula:\n    N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅\n*   This remaining N₂O₅ represents the atoms in the two anions combined. The most common and stable nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   Checking if they sum to N₂O₅:\n    (NO₃⁻) + (NO₂⁻) = N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n**4. Calculating the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    Total Atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    Total Atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis value corresponds to option A. Many of the provided candidate answers performed the correct calculation to get 17 but made typographical errors in selecting the final letter. The chemical reasoning across all sound methods converges to the same result.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided reasoning.\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Product Identification**\nThe first step is to analyze the information from the three tubes to identify the gaseous products of the decomposition.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube's weight did not change, indicating that no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is equal to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** 2.24 liters of an unreactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   A quick check using conservation of mass [Mass(C) = 7.20g (total) - 3.60g (H₂O) - 0.80g (O atoms) = 2.80g] shows that Gas C has a molar mass of 2.80g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol. This identifies Gas C as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determining the Composition of the Initial Salts**\nBy using the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts.\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** from 0.20 mol of H₂O => 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** from 0.10 mol of N₂ => 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** from H₂O and the reaction with Cu => 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe total elemental ratio in the combined equimolar mixture (one formula unit of A + one of B) is N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25. Multiplying by 20 to get integers gives the ratio **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n**3. Identifying Salts A and B**\nWe need to find two salts containing N, H, and O that combine to this formula. The presence of 8 H atoms strongly suggests two ammonium ions (2 x NH₄⁺), which together have the formula N₂H₈. Subtracting this from the total gives the composition of the two anions:\nN₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\nThe two most common nitrogen-oxygen anions that sum to N₂O₅ are the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻) and the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻).\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n**4. Answering the Question**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of each.\n*   Number of atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂) = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n*   Number of atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃) = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n*   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided solutions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products**\nThe first step is to deduce the identity and quantity of the gaseous products from the experimental results. This process is consistent across all successful analyses.\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass gain of 3.60 g corresponds to H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** The mass did not change, meaning no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced. This rules out salts containing carbon.\n*   **Tube №3 (Hot Copper):** This tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to reacting with an oxidizing gas and forming CuO. The mass increase is equal to the mass of oxygen atoms transferred.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining 2.24 L of gas at STP corresponds to:\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the Full Composition of the Gas Mixture**\nBy conservation of mass, the total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n*   The 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms could have come from either O₂ gas (0.025 mol, mass 0.80 g) or a gas like N₂O (0.05 mol, mass 2.20 g, providing 0.80 g of O). A simple mass balance check helps identify Gas C and clarifies the oxidizing gas.\n*   Mass of products identified so far = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(Oxygen source).\n*   Remaining Mass = Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O in oxidizing gas) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   This molar mass, along with its inertness, strongly identifies Gas C as **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n*   With N₂ identified, the oxygen source must have been **O₂** gas (mass = moles * M = 0.025 * 32 = 0.80 g), not N₂O. This creates a consistent mass balance.\n*   The decomposition products are: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.10 mol N₂, and 0.025 mol O₂.**\n\n**3. Identify the Salts A and B**\nThe original salts contained only Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. We need to find two equimolar salts that decompose to produce the determined amounts of gases. Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) are the prime candidates.\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n*   `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)`\n\nLet `n` be the number of moles of each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: we get `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the coefficients from the balanced equation): we get `n` mol N₂, `0.5n` mol O₂, and `2n` mol H₂O.\n\nSumming the products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nWe can solve for `n` by comparing this with our experimental results:\n*   Using O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**.\n\nWe can verify this with the other products:\n*   Predicted N₂: `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches).\n*   Predicted H₂O: `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches).\nThe salts are indeed **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) ** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n*   **Atoms in NH₄NO₂:** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in NH₄NO₃:** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis result matches the calculations performed by the vast majority of the provided answers.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe logical steps, confirmed by multiple analyses, consistently lead to the result of 17 atoms. This corresponds to option B. Several of the candidate answers made a clerical error by selecting the wrong letter after performing the correct calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the products of thermal decomposition to deduce the identity of the original salts. Let's break down the process step-by-step, following the logic presented by the most accurate candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n1.  **Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products and Their Quantities**\n    The gaseous products are analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes:\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a test for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its mass did not change, no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's mass increases by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to oxygen atoms bonding to the copper.\n        *   Molar Mass of an Oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n        *   This oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas. A common one is O₂. If the gas was O₂, the reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The moles of O₂ gas would be 0.05 mol O / 2 = 0.025 mol. Another possibility is N₂O reacting via N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO, which would mean 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted. As we will see, both possibilities lead to the same elemental composition.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** 2.24 L of a gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n2.  **Verify the Product Identities and Determine Elemental Composition**\n    Let's assume Gas C is Nitrogen (N₂), a common, inert product from decomposing nitrogenous salts. We can check if the total mass of the products (assuming the oxidizing gas was O₂) equals the initial mass.\n    *   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol × 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Total Mass = 2.80 g + 0.80 g + 3.60 g = **7.20 g**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the initial mass, confirming that the products are indeed 0.10 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.20 mol H₂O.\n\n    Now, let's find the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture:\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** 2 × moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol H**\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** 2 × moles(N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol N**\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** (2 × moles(O₂)) + (1 × moles(H₂O)) = (2 × 0.025 mol) + 0.20 mol = 0.05 + 0.20 = **0.25 mol O**\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n    We have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, which must contain N, H, and O.\n    *   The combined atomic ratio of (A + B) is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To find the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives N:H:O = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n    *   This means one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B together contain N₄H₈O₅.\n    *   The presence of H, N, and O in salts suggests ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The 8 Hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two NH₄⁺ ions (2 × N¹H⁴⁺ = N₂H₈).\n    *   The remaining atoms, which must form the two anions, are N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n    *   The two most common nitrogen oxyanions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Checking their sum: NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ = N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n    The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt combined.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**Analysis of the Provided Solutions**\n\n1.  **Deconstruction of the Problem:** All provided answers correctly deconstruct the experimental setup.\n    *   **Tube 1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** Absorbs H₂O. Mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   **Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂):** Absorbs acidic gases. No mass change means no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n    *   **Tube 3 (Red-hot Cu):** Reacts with an oxidizing gas. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted to form CuO. This corresponds to 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining 2.24 L at STP corresponds to 0.10 mol of an inert gas.\n\n2.  **Identification of Products:** By checking the law of conservation of mass, all solutions correctly identify the final unreacted gas (Gas C) as nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Mass H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Mass of reacted Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g (total) - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol, which is N₂.\n    *   So, the total products of the decomposition contain all the atoms from 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.10 mol N₂, and the 0.80 g (0.05 mol) of oxygen atoms that reacted with copper.\n\n3.  **Determination of Elemental Composition:** All solutions correctly deduce that the initial 7.20 g mixture was composed solely of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. They calculate the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n    *   Moles of H = 2 * (moles of H₂O) = 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol\n    *   Moles of N = 2 * (moles of N₂) = 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol\n    *   Moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol\n\n4.  **Identification of Salts A and B:** All solutions correctly reason that since the mixture is equimolar, the combined chemical formula for one unit of Salt A and one unit of Salt B must have the elemental ratio N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25, which simplifies to an integer ratio of N₄H₈O₅. By reasoning that the salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions, all solutions correctly identify the salts as Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   NH₄NO₂ (N₂H₄O₂) + NH₄NO₃ (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** This is the last and most critical step. The question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll fifteen candidate answers, despite some minor differences in the description of the decomposition reactions, correctly deduce that the salts are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate. Furthermore, every single one of them correctly calculates the total number of atoms in these two salts to be 17.\n\nThe discrepancies in the final answers (e.g., some choosing <<<A>>> or <<<C>>>) appear to be clerical errors in matching the calculated result of **17** with the given options. The correct option corresponding to the number 17 is **B**. The chemical reasoning is universally sound and points to this single value.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 19\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 15\n\nThe calculated value is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Identification of Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem involves analyzing the gases produced by heating a salt mixture. Each tube in the experimental setup isolates a component of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a desiccant, which absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This is a critical piece of information, indicating that **no acidic gases were formed**. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon that would form acidic oxides upon decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. The formation of CuO means it reacted with a gas containing oxygen. The mass increase of the tube corresponds to the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) reacted = 0.80 g.\n    *   The atomic mass of O is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The gas that passed through all tubes without reacting.\n    *   Volume at standard temperature and pressure (STP) = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B. We can determine the total moles of each element in the original mixture.\n\n*   All nitrogen in the system ends up in the final inert Gas C (as N₂).\n*   All hydrogen ends up in the absorbed H₂O.\n*   All oxygen ends up in the absorbed H₂O and the CuO.\n\nLet's calculate the total moles of each element:\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** From the H₂O and the reacted O.\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol (from H₂O) + 0.05 mol (from reaction with Cu) = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All the initial N is present in the final unreacted gas. The most logical identity for this inert gas is N₂.\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass:\nMass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\nMass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the salts are composed of N, H, and O and that the mixture is equimolar. Let's find the empirical formula for the combination of one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B. The ratio of the elements is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo convert this to the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.05) or multiply by 20.\nN : H : O = (0.20/0.05) : (0.40/0.05) : (0.25/0.05) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nThe combined formula of (Salt A + Salt B) is N₄H₈O₅. Since they are salts containing N and H, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n\nSubtracting the cations from the total formula gives us the composition of the anions:\nN₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n\nThe two anions together must have the formula N₂O₅. The most common and logical nitrogen oxyanions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's see if they fit:\nAnion 1 (NO₂⁻) + Anion 2 (NO₃⁻) = N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen: 2\n    *   Hydrogen: 4\n    *   Oxygen: 2\n    *   Total in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen: 2\n    *   Hydrogen: 4\n    *   Oxygen: 3\n    *   Total in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem and Identification of Products**\n\nThe core of the problem is to identify salts A and B by analyzing their gaseous decomposition products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, meaning **no acidic gases** were formed. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: Hot copper acts as a reducing agent, reacting with oxidizing gases. The formation of CuO means an oxygen-containing gas reacted. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxygen-donating gas in the mixture (like O₂ or N₂O).\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C)**: After the previous steps, 2.24 L of a gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the reagents used.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of Elemental Composition**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture of salts must contain the elements found in the products. Let's find the total moles and mass of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen is present in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N)**: The only remaining element must be nitrogen. We can verify this using the principle of mass conservation. The mass of the unreacted gas C must be the total mass minus the mass of H₂O and the mass of oxygen that reacted with copper.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g (total) - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass corresponds to nitrogen gas (N₂).\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O, and they decompose into gases. This strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions. Since the mixture is equimolar, one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B must together contain atoms in the same ratio as the moles we found: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we multiply by 20:\n**N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is N₄H₈O₅. We need to split this into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), as 2 × 4 = 8. This suggests each salt contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Two NH₄⁺ ions account for N₂H₈.\n*   The remaining atoms for the two anions are: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   The two most common nitrogen-oxygen anions that add up to N₂O₅ are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n*   Thus, the two salts must be **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) ** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂, or N₂H₄O₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃, or N₂H₄O₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a systematic breakdown of the problem to determine the correct answer. The analysis will proceed by first identifying the products of the reaction, then determining the composition of the original salts, and finally calculating the total number of atoms.\n\n**1. Identify and Quantify the Decomposition Products**\n\nThe gas mixture produced by heating the salts is analyzed by passing it through three tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a test for acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the tube's weight did not change, **no acidic gases were produced**. This indicates the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The tube contains copper, which becomes oxidized to copper oxide (CuO). The mass increase of the solid in the tube is due to the oxygen atoms that bond with the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms reacted = 0.80 g.\n    *   The atomic mass of an oxygen atom (O) is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**. This oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas like O₂ or N₂O.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** The gas that passed through all tubes without reacting.\n    *   Volume at standard temperature and pressure (STP) = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the mass and atoms in the products must equal the mass and atoms in the reactants. The products contain hydrogen, oxygen, and the element(s) from Gas C.\n\n*   First, we identify Gas C. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(Oxygen reacted) + Mass(Gas C) = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C). This doesn't seem right. The mass increase of tube 3 *is* the mass of oxygen atoms, but those atoms came from a gas that had its own mass. A better way is to find the mass of N, H, and O in the total mixture.\n    *   Total moles of **H** atoms = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol H**.\n    *   Total moles of **O** atoms = Moles(O in H₂O) + Moles(O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol O**.\n    *   Mass of H and O = (0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol) = 0.4 g + 4.0 g = 4.4 g.\n    *   The remaining mass in the initial 7.20 g mixture must be the third element.\n    *   Mass of unknown element = 7.20 g - 4.4 g = 2.8 g.\n    *   The inert Gas C (0.10 mol) is the only component left, so it must be composed of this unknown element. Its molar mass is 2.8 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol. This corresponds to nitrogen gas (**N₂**).\n    *   Therefore, the unknown element is Nitrogen (N).\n    *   Total moles of **N** atoms = 2.8 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol N**.\n\n**3. Identify the Chemical Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial equimolar mixture contained a total of 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. Since it is an equimolar mixture, let's consider the composition of one formula unit of Salt A plus one formula unit of Salt B. The atomic ratio must be:\n*   N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n*   To obtain simple integers, we multiply the ratio by 20:\n*   N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. The cation is almost certainly the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two NH₄⁺ ions, which would also account for 2 of the 4 nitrogen atoms.\n\n*   Subtracting two NH₄⁺ ions (N₂H₈) from the total formula (N₄H₈O₅) leaves **N₂O₅** for the two anions.\n*   The most logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is:\n    *   Nitrate (NO₃⁻)\n    *   Nitrite (NO₂⁻)\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products from the Gas Analysis Tubes:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its mass did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates that the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is an oxygen scavenger. It forms CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This oxygen was supplied by an oxidizing gas in the mixture.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture:**\n    By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g). The products are H₂O, some form of oxygen-containing gas, and Gas C. Based on the elements present, Gas C is most likely nitrogen (N₂). Let's verify this by checking the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H atoms = 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) × 1.0 g/mol H = 0.40 g H.\n    *   Mass of O atoms = (0.20 mol O from H₂O + 0.05 mol O from Cu tube) × 16.0 g/mol O = 4.00 g O.\n    *   Mass of Nitrogen (N) = Total mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g N.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol N.\n    *   The 0.10 mol of remaining Gas C would contain 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol of N atoms if it is N₂, which perfectly matches our calculation.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B containing a total of 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n    Let's find the elemental ratio for one formula unit of A plus one formula unit of B (A+B):\n    *   N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n    To convert this to a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value, 0.05 (or multiply the whole ratio by 20):\n    *   N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n    The combined chemical formula for (A+B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\n    Since the initial substances are salts made of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms in our combined formula correspond exactly to two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺).\n    *   Let's subtract the atoms from two NH₄⁺ ions (which is N₂H₈) from our total formula:\n    *   N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅\n    The remaining N₂O₅ must constitute the two anions for salts A and B. The most common and chemically stable nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Adding these two anions together: NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ gives a total elemental count of N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\n    Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    The final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n        *   Number of atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n        *   Number of atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n\n    The total number of atoms is the sum of the atoms in both salts:\n    *   Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
