This is a single, pure enantiomer with one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction:** The starting material is reduced with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). LAH reduces the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol group (-CHOH).\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting material is already chiral (due to C5), the two faces of the carbonyl are diastereotopic. Attack by the hydride (H⁻) on the two faces is not equally likely but will produce both possible configurations at the new C3 center, (R) and (S). The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected and remains (S).\n4.  **Products:** Two products are formed:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two chiral centers, with one being identical (5S) and the other being opposite (3R vs. 3S).\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**.\n2.  **Reaction:** The dione is reduced with excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride). \"Excess\" ensures both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). We must also consider the possibility of a meso compound due to the molecule's symmetry.\n4.  **Products:** The possible stereoisomers are:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These are non-superimposable mirror images and form an enantiomeric pair. They will be produced as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the exact same meso compound).\n    The meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\n\nThe final combined mixture contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers:\n*   Two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   Three stereoisomers (an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound) from Reaction II.\n\n**Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers.\n*   Crucially, an achiral column **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Counting the peaks:\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The three stereoisomers from Reaction II: The enantiomeric pair will elute together as one peak, while the meso compound (which is a diastereomer of the pair) will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction I are structurally distinct from those of Reaction II and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n**Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column):**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing them to be separated. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   Essentially, it can separate all stereochemically distinct compounds.\n*   Counting the peaks:\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The three stereoisomers from Reaction II: The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from each other, and it will also separate the meso compound from them. This gives **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. Comparing this to the options:\n\n*   A) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n*   B) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n*   C) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n*   D) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction I**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule containing one stereocenter at the C5 position with a specific (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction reduces the ketone group at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 (a prochiral center) creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (at C5, which is unaffected), the attack of the hydride ion on the two faces of the carbonyl is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products have one stereocenter in common and one that is different, making them **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The dione is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed, with any chiral products being formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **Meso compound:** The (2R, 4S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. This is an achiral meso compound. Note that (2S, 4R) is the same molecule.\n    *   **Enantiomeric Pair:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) configurations are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of enantiomers and are produced in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\nThe final mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5 unique stereoisomers**:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n\n### **4. Predict HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate, giving **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)-diols) are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will elute as a separate **1 peak**. So, the products from Reaction II give a total of 2 peaks.\n*   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally very different (constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas) and will be well separated.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**HPLC with Chiral Stationary Phase:**\n*   This technique uses a chiral environment to separate stereoisomers. It can separate diastereomers and, importantly, can also separate **enantiomers**.\n*   Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers in the mixture will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Therefore, all five stereoisomers will be resolved into separate peaks.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe analysis predicts **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**. Comparing this to the options:\n\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule containing a single stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5) in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The molecule is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction reduces the ketone group at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. When it is reduced, it becomes a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl from two different faces. Since the starting material is already chiral, this attack is diastereoselective and produces two different stereoisomers. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since these molecules have two stereocenters and differ in configuration at only one of them, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction I produces a mixture of **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule as it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** The molecule is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). This reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the molecule is symmetrical, we must consider the possibility of a meso compound.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images and are thus a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound).\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces a mixture of **three stereoisomeric products**: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture for HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n*   Two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   One pair of enantiomers from Reaction II.\n*   One meso compound from Reaction II.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products from Reaction I are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II, so they will be fully separated. Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of them. The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate. The three stereoisomers from Reaction II (the two enantiomers and the meso compound) will also all separate from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the five unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, we expect **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final analysis shows that there will be **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and how the resulting product mixture is separated by two different types of HPLC.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the products of Reaction I:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It has one stereocenter at carbon C5.\n    *   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced by LAH to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   **Products:** Since the starting material is chiral and the reaction creates a new stereocenter, the two possible outcomes lead to the formation of two diastereomeric products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n        *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomers are formed.\n\n2.  **Analyze the products of Reaction II:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule as it has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄ to form pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   **Products:** This reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the molecule is symmetrical, we must consider the possibility of meso compounds.\n        *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of **enantiomers**. As the reaction starts from achiral materials, they will be formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n        *   The (2R, 4S) isomer is a **meso compound**, which is achiral. The (2S, 4R) form is the same molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n3.  **Analyze the combined product mixture:**\n    *   The total number of unique stereoisomeric products in the final mixture is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 compounds**.\n\n4.  **Determine the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC (achiral column):**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   It **can** separate constitutional isomers (e.g., the products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) and **diastereomers**.\n    *   It **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   **Counting the peaks:**\n        *   From Reaction I: The two products are diastereomers and will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n        *   From Reaction II: The pair of enantiomers will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will separate from them, forming another peak. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Determine the number of peaks in chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase and is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers** and **diastereomers**.\n    *   **Counting the peaks:**\n        *   Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into a separate peak.\n    *   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts that the combined product mixture will show **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, verifying the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single enantiomer of a chiral ketone. The chiral center is at carbon C5, and it is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with LAH. The ketone carbon (C3) is prochiral. Its reduction to an alcohol creates a new chiral center.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** Because the starting molecule is already chiral, the attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the two faces of the carbonyl is not equally likely. This leads to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion:** The two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces a mixture of **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule with a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess NaBH₄. This creates pentane-2,4-diol, which has two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:**\n    1.  **Enantiomers:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule, they are formed in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    2.  **Meso Compound:** The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral meso compound. (Note: (2S, 4R) describes the same meso compound).\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers: a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Combined Mixture Analysis and HPLC**\n\nThe final product mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n*   Two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   Three stereoisomers from Reaction II (one meso compound and one enantiomeric pair).\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n*   **Principle:** Separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of the enantiomeric pair and the meso compound. The enantiomers will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will be separated from them. This gives a total of two peaks for the products of Reaction II. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally distinct and will be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column):**\n*   **Principle:** Separates all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   We have a total of five stereochemically distinct compounds in the mixture:\n        1. (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2. (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3. (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4. (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5. meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct molecules.\n*   **Total Chiral Peaks:** Each of the five unique compounds will produce a separate peak. -> **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its Products**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, containing a single, specific enantiomer with a stereocenter at C5.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 using LAH. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The reduction of the ketone (a prochiral center) creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Because the starting material is chiral, the two faces of the carbonyl group are diastereotopic. Attack by the hydride ion will form two products, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Product Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters. One center is the same (5S) and one is different (3R vs. 3S). They are stereoisomers but not mirror images, so they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** It produces **2 distinct stereoisomers** (a pair of diastereomers).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its Products**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups using excess NaBH₄. This creates new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. We must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images. They form an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry. It is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) designation describes the same meso molecule).\n*   **Product Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** It produces **3 distinct stereoisomers** (a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds with different physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **The combined mixture contains:**\n    *   From Reaction I: Two diastereomers. Since they have different physical properties, they will be separated. This contributes **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II: A meso compound and an enantiomeric pair. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak. This contributes **2 peaks** (1 for the meso, 1 for the enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different and will not overlap.\n*   **Total Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. It is specifically designed to separate enantiomers, in addition to being able to separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   **The combined mixture contains 5 distinct stereoisomers:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** Since all five of these compounds are chemically and stereochemically unique, a chiral HPLC column with adequate resolution will separate all of them.\n*   **Total Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n**Step 5: Match the Conclusion to the Options**\n*   The analysis predicts **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**.\n*   Let's check the options:\n    A) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n    B) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n    C) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n    D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n*   Our result perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical reasoning, even though the final letter choice varies due to either inconsistent option lists or errors. The core analysis of the problem is consistent across all candidates. Here is a step-by-step breakdown consolidating the unanimous reasoning.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule containing a single stereocenter (C5) in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction of the prochiral ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is already chiral (at C5, which is unaffected by the reaction), the two products formed will have configurations (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S). These two molecules are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, making them **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, producing pentane-2,4-diol. The possible stereoisomers are:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since the reaction starts from an achiral material, these are formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed (the two enantiomers and the meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Total Products in the Final Mixture**\n\nCombining the products from both reactions gives a total of 2 + 3 = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers but cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   **Separation of the Mixture:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from it. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I are structurally different from those of Reaction II, so they will be separated from each other. Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Analysis with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Uses a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Separation of the Mixture:**\n    *   The chiral column will separate all five unique stereoisomers from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce a distinct peak. Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the unanimous reasoning of all candidate answers, the analysis leads to:\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n*   **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**\n\nThis corresponds to option C in the question's provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer with one chiral center at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced by LAH to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting molecule is chiral, the reduction is diastereoselective. The reaction produces two stereoisomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers** of each other because they differ in configuration at one stereocenter (C3) but are the same at another (C5).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule with a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄ to form pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is symmetrical and achiral, we must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol: This is a pair of **enantiomers**. They are formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture.**\nThe total mixture contains **five** distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC.**\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Count:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different properties and will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) will elute together as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will be separated from them, creating a second peak. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I are structurally distinct from those of Reaction II and will be separated.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the number of peaks in chiral HPLC.**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase and is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Count:**\n    *   The five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Each unique stereoisomer will produce a separate peak.\n    *   Total Peaks = (2 from Rxn I) + (3 from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the chemist will observe **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option B. A supermajority of the candidate answers performed the same chemical analysis and arrived at this conclusion in their reasoning, even if some of them selected the wrong letter.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the problem, integrating the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single, specific stereocenter at carbon C5 (the (S) configuration). The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone group at C3 with LAH. LAH reduces the C=O to a C-OH.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction and remains in the (S) configuration.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon at C3 is planar and prochiral. The reduction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The hydride ion can attack from two different faces of the carbonyl, leading to either an (R) or (S) configuration at the new C3 center.\n    *   Since the starting molecule is chiral, the two products formed are diastereomers (not produced in a 1:1 ratio).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** Two distinct compounds are formed:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction I produces a mixture of **two diastereomers**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (`CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`). This molecule is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess NaBH₄. This creates two C-OH groups.\n*   **Product:** Pentane-2,4-diol (`CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed in a way that the final mixture is optically inactive.\n    *   Let's analyze the possibilities:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This isomer has an internal plane of symmetry. It is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule).\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**: a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomeric compounds (two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II).\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **It can separate diastereomers.**\n*   **It cannot separate enantiomers.**\n\nLet's count the expected peaks:\n1.  **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will be separated. → **2 peaks**.\n2.  **From Reaction II:** The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the pair. The two enantiomers will elute together (co-elute). This gives a total of two separable groups. → **2 peaks**.\n\nThe total number of peaks on a normal-phase column is the sum, as the products from the two reactions are structurally very different and will not accidentally co-elute.\n**Total Peaks (Normal-Phase) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\nA chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to separate all stereoisomers.\n*   **It can separate diastereomers.**\n*   **It can separate enantiomers.**\n\nLet's count the expected peaks:\nWe have five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nSince a chiral column can resolve all of these unique compounds, we expect one peak for each.\n**Total Peaks (Chiral) = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that there will be **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram and **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single, pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). LAH is a strong reducing agent that converts the ketone (C=O) into a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a *new* stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (due to C5), the hydride attack on the two different faces of the carbonyl group is diastereoselective. This means both possible products are formed, resulting in a new stereocenter at C3 with either an (R) or (S) configuration. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion:** These two products are **diastereomers** of each other because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S). Therefore, Reaction I produces a mixture of **two** distinct chemical compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, producing pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting molecule is achiral, we need to analyze all possible stereoisomeric products.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry. It is an achiral **meso compound**. Note that the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomeric compounds: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an **achiral** stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **will be separated**.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **will not be separated**. They co-elute as a single peak.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of the enantiomeric pair and the meso compound. The enantiomers will co-elute, giving **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the pair and will be separated from them, giving another **1 peak**. So, the products from Reaction II give a total of 2 peaks.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products from Reaction I are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II and will not co-elute. The total number of peaks is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a **chiral** stationary phase. This allows for the separation of compounds that differ in their three-dimensional structure, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The final mixture contains a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 distinct stereoisomers**.\n        1. (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2. (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3. (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4. (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5. meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   A chiral HPLC column, by design, can resolve all these different species. Each will interact uniquely with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Assuming the column provides adequate separation, we will observe one peak for each of the 5 distinct stereoisomers. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the chemical reactions and separation techniques reveals the following:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single enantiomer of a chiral ketone, with the stereocenter at C5.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with LAH. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is chiral, the reduction results in the formation of two diastereomeric products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction I produces a mixture of **two** distinct chemical compounds (diastereomers).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketones with excess NaBH₄. This creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The resulting product is pentane-2,4-diol. The possible stereoisomers are a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol). Since the reaction starts from an achiral material, the enantiomers will be formed as a racemic (1:1) mixture.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces a mixture of **three** distinct stereoisomers (one meso compound and two enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture.**\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions, for a total of 2 + 3 = **5** unique stereoisomers.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the number of peaks on a normal-phase HPLC column.**\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.

This is a chiral molecule because it has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5, which is specified to have the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction:** The molecule is treated with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), a strong reducing agent. This reaction reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a *new* stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (due to C5), the attack of the hydride ion on the two different faces of the carbonyl group is diastereoselective. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. This process results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The two products formed are **diastereomers** of each other. Therefore, Reaction I produces **two distinct stereoisomeric compounds**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The reactant is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule as it has a plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Reaction:** The molecule is treated with excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed, resulting in an optically inactive mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** form a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound** (an achiral molecule with stereocenters). The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, Reaction II produces **three distinct stereoisomeric compounds**: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5 unique stereoisomeric compounds**:\n1.

(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Prediction of HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair (as they are diastereomers).

This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The stereocenter at carbon C5, which is specified as having the (S) configuration, will not participate in the reaction.\n    *   **Reagents**: Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   **Reaction**: LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral, meaning the reduction creates a new stereocenter.\n    *   **Products of Reaction I**: Since the starting molecule is chiral, the two faces of the carbonyl are diastereotopic. The hydride attack will create both (R) and (S) configurations at the new stereocenter (C3), resulting in a mixture of two **diastereomers**:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.

A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly deduced this result, some made errors in selecting the final letter. The scientific reasoning is consistently sound across the majority of the agents, confirming this outcome.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemistry problem, taking into account the reasoning provided by the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single, pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone group at C3 with LAH. This reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is chiral, the reduction is diastereoselective. Two products are formed: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because one stereocenter is the same (C5) and the other is different (C3).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed. This point is correctly identified by all agents.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral, symmetrical molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess NaBH₄. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. Since the starting material is achiral, the possible stereoisomers are:\n    1.  A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. They are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. (The (2S, 4R) designation represents the same meso compound).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. This point is also correctly identified by all agents.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound (a diastereomer of the other two) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers will not separate from each other and will elute as a single peak. This yields **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different and will be well-separated.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase and can separate enantiomers in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, every unique stereoisomer in the mixture can be resolved.\n*   **Analysis:** The total mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct, a chiral HPLC column will resolve them all.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the final mixture will produce:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis result matches option C. Several of the provided answers contained correct reasoning but made an error in selecting the final letter corresponding to their conclusion. The underlying scientific analysis, however, is overwhelmingly consistent and correct.\n\n**A) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n**B) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC**\n**C) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n**D) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, based on a synthesis of the provided reasoning.\n\n### **Summary of Analysis**\n\nAll provided answers, despite their different final letter choices, follow a nearly identical and correct logical path to determine the number and types of products and how they would be observed in chromatography.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I Products**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a single, pure enantiomer. It has one chiral center at C5.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with LAH creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Outcome:** The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected, while the new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This produces two molecules: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion:** These two products are **diastereomers** of each other. Reaction I yields **two** distinct chemical compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II Products**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral, symmetrical molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketones with NaBH₄ creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4, resulting in the product pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Outcome:** Because the starting material is achiral, a comprehensive set of stereoisomers is formed. Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are three possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are formed in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II yields **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different and will be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase can separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The final combined mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column can resolve all five of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe analysis consistently concludes that the experiment will produce **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5, which is specified as having the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone at C3 is reduced by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The starting material is chiral. When a new stereocenter is created, the reaction is diastereoselective. The two possible configurations at the new C3 center (R and S) lead to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: The two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that differs (3R vs 3S). They are stereoisomers but not mirror images, which defines them as **diastereomers**. Thus, Reaction I produces **two** distinct chemical compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant**: Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, resulting in pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed, resulting in an overall optically inactive mixture.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This is a pair of **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images). They are formed in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. The reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and Chromatographic Separation**\n\nThe final combined mixture contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers (two from Reaction I + three from Reaction II).\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It **can** separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute). This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks**: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: This technique uses a chiral stationary phase and is designed to separate all unique stereoisomers, including **enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers: (3R,5S)-alcohol, (3S,5S)-alcohol, (2R,4R)-diol, (2S,4S)-diol, and the meso-diol.\n    *   A chiral column is capable of resolving all of them.\n*   **Total Peaks**: **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>"

This is a single, pure enantiomer with one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction:** The starting material is reduced with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). LAH reduces the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol group (-CHOH).\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting material is already chiral (due to C5), the two faces of the carbonyl are diastereotopic. Attack by the hydride (H⁻) on the two faces is not equally likely but will produce both possible configurations at the new C3 center, (R) and (S).

This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**.\n2.  **Reaction:** The dione is reduced with excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride). \"Excess\" ensures both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). We must also consider the possibility of a meso compound due to the molecule's symmetry.\n4.  **Products:** The possible stereoisomers are:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These are non-superimposable mirror images and form an enantiomeric pair. They will be produced as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the exact same meso compound).\n    The meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\n\nThe final combined mixture contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers:\n*   Two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   Three stereoisomers (an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound) from Reaction II.\n\n**Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).

Analyze Reaction I**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule containing one stereocenter at the C5 position with a specific (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction reduces the ketone group at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 (a prochiral center) creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (at C5, which is unaffected), the attack of the hydride ion on the two faces of the carbonyl is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products have one stereocenter in common and one that is different, making them **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The dione is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed, with any chiral products being formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **Meso compound:** The (2R, 4S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. This is an achiral meso compound. Note that (2S, 4R) is the same molecule.\n    *   **Enantiomeric Pair:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) configurations are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of enantiomers and are produced in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\nThe final mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5 unique stereoisomers**:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n\n### **4. Predict HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate, giving **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)-diols) are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will elute as a separate **1 peak**. So, the products from Reaction II give a total of 2 peaks.\n*   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally very different (constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas) and will be well separated.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**HPLC with Chiral Stationary Phase:**\n*   This technique uses a chiral environment to separate stereoisomers. It can separate diastereomers and, importantly, can also separate **enantiomers**.\n*   Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers in the mixture will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Therefore, all five stereoisomers will be resolved into separate peaks.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe analysis predicts **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**. Comparing this to the options:\n\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule containing a single stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5) in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The molecule is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction reduces the ketone group at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. When it is reduced, it becomes a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl from two different faces. Since the starting material is already chiral, this attack is diastereoselective and produces two different stereoisomers. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since these molecules have two stereocenters and differ in configuration at only one of them, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction I produces a mixture of **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule as it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** The molecule is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). This reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the molecule is symmetrical, we must consider the possibility of a meso compound.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images and are thus a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound).\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces a mixture of **three stereoisomeric products**: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture for HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n*   Two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   One pair of enantiomers from Reaction II.\n*   One meso compound from Reaction II.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products from Reaction I are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II, so they will be fully separated. Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of them. The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate. The three stereoisomers from Reaction II (the two enantiomers and the meso compound) will also all separate from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the five unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, we expect **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final analysis shows that there will be **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and how the resulting product mixture is separated by two different types of HPLC.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the products of Reaction I:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It has one stereocenter at carbon C5.\n    *   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced by LAH to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   **Products:** Since the starting material is chiral and the reaction creates a new stereocenter, the two possible outcomes lead to the formation of two diastereomeric products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n        *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomers are formed.\n\n2.  **Analyze the products of Reaction II:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule as it has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄ to form pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   **Products:** This reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the molecule is symmetrical, we must consider the possibility of meso compounds.\n        *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of **enantiomers**. As the reaction starts from achiral materials, they will be formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n        *   The (2R, 4S) isomer is a **meso compound**, which is achiral. The (2S, 4R) form is the same molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n3.  **Analyze the combined product mixture:**\n    *   The total number of unique stereoisomeric products in the final mixture is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 compounds**.\n\n4.  **Determine the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC (achiral column):**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   It **can** separate constitutional isomers (e.g., the products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) and **diastereomers**.\n    *   It **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   **Counting the peaks:**\n        *   From Reaction I: The two products are diastereomers and will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n        *   From Reaction II: The pair of enantiomers will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will separate from them, forming another peak. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Determine the number of peaks in chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase and is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers** and **diastereomers**.\n    *   **Counting the peaks:**\n        *   Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into a separate peak.\n    *   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts that the combined product mixture will show **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, verifying the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single enantiomer of a chiral ketone. The chiral center is at carbon C5, and it is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with LAH. The ketone carbon (C3) is prochiral. Its reduction to an alcohol creates a new chiral center.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** Because the starting molecule is already chiral, the attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the two faces of the carbonyl is not equally likely. This leads to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion:** The two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces a mixture of **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule with a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess NaBH₄. This creates pentane-2,4-diol, which has two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:**\n    1.  **Enantiomers:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule, they are formed in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    2.  **Meso Compound:** The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral meso compound. (Note: (2S, 4R) describes the same meso compound).\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers: a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Combined Mixture Analysis and HPLC**\n\nThe final product mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n*   Two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   Three stereoisomers from Reaction II (one meso compound and one enantiomeric pair).\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n*   **Principle:** Separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of the enantiomeric pair and the meso compound. The enantiomers will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will be separated from them. This gives a total of two peaks for the products of Reaction II. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally distinct and will be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column):**\n*   **Principle:** Separates all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   We have a total of five stereochemically distinct compounds in the mixture:\n        1. (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2. (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3. (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4. (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5. meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct molecules.\n*   **Total Chiral Peaks:** Each of the five unique compounds will produce a separate peak. -> **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its Products**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, containing a single, specific enantiomer with a stereocenter at C5.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 using LAH. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The reduction of the ketone (a prochiral center) creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Because the starting material is chiral, the two faces of the carbonyl group are diastereotopic. Attack by the hydride ion will form two products, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Product Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters. One center is the same (5S) and one is different (3R vs. 3S). They are stereoisomers but not mirror images, so they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** It produces **2 distinct stereoisomers** (a pair of diastereomers).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its Products**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups using excess NaBH₄. This creates new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. We must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images. They form an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry. It is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) designation describes the same meso molecule).\n*   **Product Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** It produces **3 distinct stereoisomers** (a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds with different physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **The combined mixture contains:**\n    *   From Reaction I: Two diastereomers. Since they have different physical properties, they will be separated. This contributes **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II: A meso compound and an enantiomeric pair. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak. This contributes **2 peaks** (1 for the meso, 1 for the enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different and will not overlap.\n*   **Total Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. It is specifically designed to separate enantiomers, in addition to being able to separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   **The combined mixture contains 5 distinct stereoisomers:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** Since all five of these compounds are chemically and stereochemically unique, a chiral HPLC column with adequate resolution will separate all of them.\n*   **Total Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n**Step 5: Match the Conclusion to the Options**\n*   The analysis predicts **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**.\n*   Let's check the options:\n    A) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n    B) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n    C) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n    D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n*   Our result perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical reasoning, even though the final letter choice varies due to either inconsistent option lists or errors. The core analysis of the problem is consistent across all candidates. Here is a step-by-step breakdown consolidating the unanimous reasoning.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule containing a single stereocenter (C5) in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction of the prochiral ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is already chiral (at C5, which is unaffected by the reaction), the two products formed will have configurations (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S). These two molecules are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, making them **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, producing pentane-2,4-diol. The possible stereoisomers are:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since the reaction starts from an achiral material, these are formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed (the two enantiomers and the meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Total Products in the Final Mixture**\n\nCombining the products from both reactions gives a total of 2 + 3 = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers but cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   **Separation of the Mixture:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from it. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I are structurally different from those of Reaction II, so they will be separated from each other. Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Analysis with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Uses a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Separation of the Mixture:**\n    *   The chiral column will separate all five unique stereoisomers from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce a distinct peak. Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the unanimous reasoning of all candidate answers, the analysis leads to:\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n*   **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**\n\nThis corresponds to option C in the question's provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer with one chiral center at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced by LAH to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting molecule is chiral, the reduction is diastereoselective. The reaction produces two stereoisomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers** of each other because they differ in configuration at one stereocenter (C3) but are the same at another (C5).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule with a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄ to form pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is symmetrical and achiral, we must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol: This is a pair of **enantiomers**. They are formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture.**\nThe total mixture contains **five** distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC.**\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Count:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different properties and will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) will elute together as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will be separated from them, creating a second peak. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I are structurally distinct from those of Reaction II and will be separated.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the number of peaks in chiral HPLC.**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase and is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Count:**\n    *   The five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Each unique stereoisomer will produce a separate peak.\n    *   Total Peaks = (2 from Rxn I) + (3 from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the chemist will observe **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option B. A supermajority of the candidate answers performed the same chemical analysis and arrived at this conclusion in their reasoning, even if some of them selected the wrong letter.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the problem, integrating the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single, specific stereocenter at carbon C5 (the (S) configuration). The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone group at C3 with LAH. LAH reduces the C=O to a C-OH.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction and remains in the (S) configuration.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon at C3 is planar and prochiral. The reduction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The hydride ion can attack from two different faces of the carbonyl, leading to either an (R) or (S) configuration at the new C3 center.\n    *   Since the starting molecule is chiral, the two products formed are diastereomers (not produced in a 1:1 ratio).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** Two distinct compounds are formed:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction I produces a mixture of **two diastereomers**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (`CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`). This molecule is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess NaBH₄. This creates two C-OH groups.\n*   **Product:** Pentane-2,4-diol (`CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed in a way that the final mixture is optically inactive.\n    *   Let's analyze the possibilities:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This isomer has an internal plane of symmetry. It is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule).\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**: a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomeric compounds (two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II).\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **It can separate diastereomers.**\n*   **It cannot separate enantiomers.**\n\nLet's count the expected peaks:\n1.  **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will be separated. → **2 peaks**.\n2.  **From Reaction II:** The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the pair. The two enantiomers will elute together (co-elute). This gives a total of two separable groups. → **2 peaks**.\n\nThe total number of peaks on a normal-phase column is the sum, as the products from the two reactions are structurally very different and will not accidentally co-elute.\n**Total Peaks (Normal-Phase) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\nA chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to separate all stereoisomers.\n*   **It can separate diastereomers.**\n*   **It can separate enantiomers.**\n\nLet's count the expected peaks:\nWe have five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nSince a chiral column can resolve all of these unique compounds, we expect one peak for each.\n**Total Peaks (Chiral) = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that there will be **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram and **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single, pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). LAH is a strong reducing agent that converts the ketone (C=O) into a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a *new* stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (due to C5), the hydride attack on the two different faces of the carbonyl group is diastereoselective. This means both possible products are formed, resulting in a new stereocenter at C3 with either an (R) or (S) configuration. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion:** These two products are **diastereomers** of each other because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S). Therefore, Reaction I produces a mixture of **two** distinct chemical compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, producing pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting molecule is achiral, we need to analyze all possible stereoisomeric products.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry. It is an achiral **meso compound**. Note that the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomeric compounds: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an **achiral** stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **will be separated**.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **will not be separated**. They co-elute as a single peak.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of the enantiomeric pair and the meso compound. The enantiomers will co-elute, giving **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the pair and will be separated from them, giving another **1 peak**. So, the products from Reaction II give a total of 2 peaks.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products from Reaction I are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II and will not co-elute. The total number of peaks is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a **chiral** stationary phase. This allows for the separation of compounds that differ in their three-dimensional structure, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The final mixture contains a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 distinct stereoisomers**.\n        1. (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2. (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3. (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4. (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5. meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   A chiral HPLC column, by design, can resolve all these different species. Each will interact uniquely with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Assuming the column provides adequate separation, we will observe one peak for each of the 5 distinct stereoisomers. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the chemical reactions and separation techniques reveals the following:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single enantiomer of a chiral ketone, with the stereocenter at C5.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with LAH. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is chiral, the reduction results in the formation of two diastereomeric products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction I produces a mixture of **two** distinct chemical compounds (diastereomers).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketones with excess NaBH₄. This creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The resulting product is pentane-2,4-diol. The possible stereoisomers are a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol). Since the reaction starts from an achiral material, the enantiomers will be formed as a racemic (1:1) mixture.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces a mixture of **three** distinct stereoisomers (one meso compound and two enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture.**\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions, for a total of 2 + 3 = **5** unique stereoisomers.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the number of peaks on a normal-phase HPLC column.**\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, however, are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as one peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n    *   The products from the two reactions are structurally distinct and will be separated from each other.\n    *   **Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n**Step 5: Predict the number of peaks on a chiral HPLC column.**\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that can form transient, diastereomeric interactions with chiral analytes. It can separate diastereomers and **can also** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The column will separate every distinct stereoisomer in the mixture.\n    *   We have a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   **Total peaks = 5 peaks.**\n\n**Final Result:**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The reactant is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule because it has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5, which is specified to have the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction:** The molecule is treated with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), a strong reducing agent. This reaction reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a *new* stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (due to C5), the attack of the hydride ion on the two different faces of the carbonyl group is diastereoselective. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. This process results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The two products formed are **diastereomers** of each other. Therefore, Reaction I produces **two distinct stereoisomeric compounds**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The reactant is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule as it has a plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Reaction:** The molecule is treated with excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed, resulting in an optically inactive mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** form a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound** (an achiral molecule with stereocenters). The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, Reaction II produces **three distinct stereoisomeric compounds**: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5 unique stereoisomeric compounds**:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Prediction of HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair (as they are diastereomers). The two enantiomers will elute together as a single peak. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase and is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers** and diastereomers.\n    *   Since the final mixture contains 5 stereochemically unique compounds, an ideal chiral column will resolve all of them.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the consistent analysis across all candidate answers, the expected outcome is:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis matches option C from the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of two chemical reactions and the subsequent separation of the combined products using two different HPLC techniques.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I**\n    *   **Reactant**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The stereocenter at carbon C5, which is specified as having the (S) configuration, will not participate in the reaction.\n    *   **Reagents**: Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   **Reaction**: LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral, meaning the reduction creates a new stereocenter.\n    *   **Products of Reaction I**: Since the starting molecule is chiral, the two faces of the carbonyl are diastereotopic. The hydride attack will create both (R) and (S) configurations at the new stereocenter (C3), resulting in a mixture of two **diastereomers**:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Conclusion**: Reaction I produces **2** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II**\n    *   **Reactant**: Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule as it has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Reagents**: Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   **Reaction**: The excess NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, producing pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   **Products of Reaction II**: Because the starting material is achiral, we analyze all possible stereoisomers of the product. Due to the molecule's symmetry, three distinct stereoisomers are formed:\n        1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n        2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. (The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound).\n    *   **Conclusion**: Reaction II produces **3** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   The total mixture contains 2 products from Reaction I and 3 products from Reaction II, for a total of **5** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Separation by Normal-Phase HPLC**\n    *   A normal-phase HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   It **can** separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers.\n    *   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, which co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Let's count the peaks:\n        *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I are separable. This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, however, are not separable from each other. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n        *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different molecules and will be separated from each other.\n        *   **Total Peaks**: 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Separation by Chiral HPLC**\n    *   An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is specifically designed to create a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers, in addition to separating diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n    *   Each of the **5** unique stereoisomers in the mixture will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and, assuming adequate resolution, will elute at a different time.\n    *   **Total Peaks**: **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC**: 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC**: 5 peaks\n\nThis result corresponds directly to option C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly deduced this result, some made errors in selecting the final letter. The scientific reasoning is consistently sound across the majority of the agents, confirming this outcome.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemistry problem, taking into account the reasoning provided by the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single, pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone group at C3 with LAH. This reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is chiral, the reduction is diastereoselective. Two products are formed: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because one stereocenter is the same (C5) and the other is different (C3).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed. This point is correctly identified by all agents.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral, symmetrical molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess NaBH₄. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. Since the starting material is achiral, the possible stereoisomers are:\n    1.  A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. They are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. (The (2S, 4R) designation represents the same meso compound).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. This point is also correctly identified by all agents.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound (a diastereomer of the other two) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers will not separate from each other and will elute as a single peak. This yields **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different and will be well-separated.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase and can separate enantiomers in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, every unique stereoisomer in the mixture can be resolved.\n*   **Analysis:** The total mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct, a chiral HPLC column will resolve them all.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the final mixture will produce:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis result matches option C.

It has one chiral center at C5.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with LAH creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Outcome:** The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected, while the new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This produces two molecules: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion:** These two products are **diastereomers** of each other. Reaction I yields **two** distinct chemical compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II Products**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral, symmetrical molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketones with NaBH₄ creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4, resulting in the product pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Outcome:** Because the starting material is achiral, a comprehensive set of stereoisomers is formed. Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are three possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are formed in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II yields **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak.
