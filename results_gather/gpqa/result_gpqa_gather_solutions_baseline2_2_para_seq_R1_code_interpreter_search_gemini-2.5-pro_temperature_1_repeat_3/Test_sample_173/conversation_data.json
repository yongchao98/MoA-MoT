Their combined rest-mass energy is `E_final_rest = (m1 + m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Ratio:** The more massive fragment `m1` is twice the mass of `m2`, so `m1 = 2*m2`. This also means their rest-mass energies have the same ratio: `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n\nWe can now solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n`2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`3*(m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\n`m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total kinetic energy released\n\nThe energy released (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate T1 using the Classical Approximation\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite direction.\n*   Classical kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Therefore, `p^2 = 2*m1*T1_classical` and `p^2 = 2*m2*T2_classical`.\n*   Equating these gives `m1*T1_classical = m2*T2_classical`, or `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV` => `3*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate T1 using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula\n\nThe relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`.\nSince the momenta `p` are equal for both fragments:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nSubstitute the known values (`m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`) and the relation `T2 = 3 - T1` (all in GeV):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the difference\n\nThe difference is between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\nDifference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\nDifference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nConvert this to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\nDifference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers and Final Decision\n\nAlmost all candidate answers that show their work correctly derive the numerical result of 5 MeV. However, they disagree on the final letter choice because they were presented with different option lists.\n\n*   A large number of agents calculate 5 MeV but select an incorrect letter, indicating a flaw in their final selection step.\n*   A smaller, but significant, group of agents (e.g., 6, 9, 12, 13) correctly calculate 5 MeV and choose the letter `D`, which corresponds to 5 MeV in the option list they were given (`A) 2 MeV. B) 20 MeV. C) 10 MeV. D) 5 MeV.`).\n\nSince this group of agents demonstrates self-consistency between their calculation and their final choice, their answer is the most reliable. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option D in the consistent set of answers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of the provided solutions shows a strong consensus on the calculation method and the numerical result. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to confirm the correct answer.\n\n**1. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy, `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Let the rest-mass energies of the two fragments be `E1_rest = m1*c^2` (more massive) and `E2_rest = m2*c^2`.\n*   We are given `m1 = 2*m2`, which implies `E1_rest = 2*E2_rest`.\n*   We are also given that the sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n*   Therefore, `E1_rest + E2_rest = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we solve the system of equations:\n    *   `E1_rest + E2_rest = 297 GeV`\n    *   `E1_rest = 2*E2_rest`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first:\n    *   `2*E2_rest + E2_rest = 297 GeV`\n    *   `3*E2_rest = 297 GeV` => `E2_rest = 99 GeV`.\n*   And for the more massive fragment:\n    *   `E1_rest = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   This step is performed correctly by all agents that show their work.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\n*   By conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass is converted into kinetic energy (`Q`).\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (E1_rest + E2_rest)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This step is also consistently performed correctly.\n\n**3. Calculate `T1` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   Due to conservation of momentum (from an initial state of rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`|p1| = |p2| = p`).\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   Therefore, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Since `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`:\n    *   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV` => `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   All agents performing this step arrive at this correct result.\n\n**4. Calculate `T1` using the Correct Relativistic Formulas**\n\n*   Again, conservation of momentum gives `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   The relativistic relationship for momentum is `(p*c)^2 = E_total^2 - E_rest^2`, where `E_total` is the total energy (rest + kinetic).\n*   Since the momenta are equal: `E1_total^2 - E1_rest^2 = E2_total^2 - E2_rest^2`.\n*   We also know from conservation of energy that `E1_total + E2_total = E_initial = 300 GeV`, so `E2_total = 300 - E1_total`.\n*   Substituting all known values (in GeV):\n    *   `E1_total^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1_total)^2 - (99)^2`\n    *   `E1_total^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1_total + E1_total^2) - 9801`\n*   The `E1_total^2` terms cancel:\n    *   `-39204 = 80199 - 600*E1_total`\n    *   `600*E1_total = 80199 + 39204 = 119403`\n    *   `E1_total = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   The correct kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy:\n    *   `T1_correct = E1_total - E1_rest = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   This calculation is correctly performed by all agents who attempt it.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\n*   Difference = `T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Convert to MeV**\n\n*   The options are given in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. Several candidate answers show this correct calculation but then select the wrong letter choice. Based on the options provided in the prompt (`A) 5 MeV. B) 10 MeV. C) 2 MeV. D) 20 MeV.`), the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero. Its rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc²` is 300 GeV.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, with rest masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relation:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We designate the more massive one as `m₁`, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) when calculated using the correct relativistic formula versus the classical approximation.\n\n**2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nIt is most convenient to work with rest-mass energies (`mc²`).\n*   The total rest-mass energy of the two fragments is `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   The relationship `m₁ = 2m₂` translates to `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We now solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²) `\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment)\n*   And for the more massive fragment:\n    `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThe total kinetic energy shared between the fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies `p² = 2mT`.\n*   Equating the momenta: `2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical` -> `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives us `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Substitute this into the total kinetic energy equation:\n    `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship between total energy (`E = T + mc²`), momentum, and rest-mass energy is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. Rearranging gives `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n*   Since `|p₁| = |p₂|`, we have `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`. Therefore:\n    `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`\n*   From conservation of total energy, `E₁ + E₂ = E_initial = 300 GeV`. We can use this to solve the momentum equation.\n*   Rearranging the momentum equation:\n    `E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n    `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²`\n    `(E₁ - E₂) * 300 = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n    `E₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Now we have a simple system of two linear equations:\n    1.  `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`\n    2.  `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Adding the two equations: `2E₁ = 398.01 GeV` -> `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   The kinetic energy `T₁` is the total energy `E₁` minus the rest-mass energy `m₁c²`:\n    `T₁_correct = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\n**7. Convert to MeV**\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m1` (more massive) and `m2`.\n*   We are given two relationships:\n    1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   It's more convenient to work with rest-mass energies (`E = mc^2`). So, `E_m1 = 2 * E_m2` and `E_m1 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_initial`.\n*   Substituting the known `E_initial`: `E_m1 + E_m2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we solve the system of equations:\n    *   Substitute `E_m1 = 2 * E_m2` into the sum: `(2 * E_m2) + E_m2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   `3 * E_m2 = 297 GeV` => `E_m2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Then, `E_m1 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   So, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `E_m1 = 198 GeV`, and the less massive fragment is `E_m2 = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\n*   The total kinetic energy `Q` released is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = E_initial - (E_m1 + E_m2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This energy is shared between the fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)**\n\n*   The initial nucleus was at rest, so by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass: `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   This gives `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Substitute this into the total kinetic energy equation:\n    *   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_correct)**\n\n*   We still use the conservation of momentum `|p1| = |p2|`.\n*   The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, we can set their squared values equal:\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(E_m1) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(E_m2)`\n*   Substitute the known values: `E_m1 = 198 GeV`, `E_m2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms cancel out from both sides. Now, we group the terms to solve for `T1`:\n    *   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    *   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    *   `600*T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1_correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Difference**\n\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Convert to MeV**\n\n*   The options are given in MeV. We use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**1. Determine the Initial and Final Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** The problem states the initial nucleus is at rest with a rest-mass energy `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energies:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are given the relationship `m1 = 2 * m2`. In terms of rest-mass energy, this means `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n    *   The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`. In terms of energy, this is `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2)`.\n    *   Substituting the known initial energy: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Solve for Individual Fragment Energies:** We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n    Substitute (2) into (1): `(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Energy of the less massive fragment: `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2.

Calculate `T1` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus was at rest (`p=0`), so the final fragments must have equal magnitude and opposite direction momenta: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** We can establish the ratio: `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n    Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, this ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T1_classical`:** Use the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV` => `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate `T1` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The momentum magnitudes are still equal, `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E_total^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy `T` as `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*E_rest`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n*   **Solving for `T1`:** Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.

Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments. Let's call them fragment 1 (more massive) and fragment 2 (less massive).\n    *   Rest masses: `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   Kinetic energies: `T₁` and `T₂`.\n    *   Momenta: `p₁` and `p₂`.\n\n### **2. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe are given two relationships:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\nWe can express these in terms of rest-mass energy (`E_rest = mc²`):\n1.  `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`.\n2.  `E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow, we solve this system of equations:\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second: `(2 * E_rest₂) + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`.\n*   This gives `3 * E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`, so `E_rest₂ = 99 GeV`.\n*   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `E_rest₁ = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (E_rest₁ + E_rest₂)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy shared between the fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal magnitude and opposite direction momenta: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\n*   The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   We can establish a ratio: `T₁_cl / T₂_cl = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_cl = 2 * T₁_cl`.\n*   Substitute this into the total kinetic energy equation: `T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_cl + 2*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T₁_cl = 3 GeV`, which means `T₁_cl = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate T₁ using Correct Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n\n*   Again, since momenta are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n*   `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and simplify:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, we convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the provided solutions reveals a remarkably consistent calculation process across all agents who showed their work.

Here is a breakdown of the steps, which have been verified for accuracy.\n\n**1. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus (M) is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (m1 and m2) is 99% of M. Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `(m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other (`m1 = 2 * m2`). This also means their rest-mass energies have the same relationship: `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   Solving the system of equations:\n    *   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   `3*(m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment)\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment)\n*   This step is performed correctly by all agents that show their work.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n*   The energy released is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energy, which is converted to kinetic energy (`Q = T1 + T2`).\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This step is also performed correctly by all agents.\n\n**3. Calculation of T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n*   By conservation of momentum, the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p`).\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`. This means kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, we get `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV`, which yields `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   This classical calculation is correct in all detailed solutions.\n\n**4. Calculation of T1 using Relativistic Formulas (Correct Value):**\n*   Using the conservation of momentum (`p1=p2`) with the relativistic relation `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`, we get:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   Substituting `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   Solving this equation for T1 gives:\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   This relativistic calculation is also performed correctly across the board.\n\n**5. Final Difference Calculation:**\n*   The difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n    `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Converting to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reasoning and calculation in all detailed candidate answers are correct and consistently lead to a difference of **5 MeV**. Any discrepancies in the final letter choice (e.g., A, B, D) are due to variations in the option ordering presented to each agent.

Let m₁ be the more massive one, so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This also means their rest-mass energies are related by `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`.\n    *   We now have a system of two equations:\n        1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n        2.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n    *   Substituting the second equation into the first: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Solving for `m₂c²`, we get `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    *   By conservation of energy, the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energy is released as kinetic energy (Q).\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   The total kinetic energy shared by the fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n3.  **Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n    *   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal magnitude momenta (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n    *   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    *   This means kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass: `T₁ / T₂ = m₂ / m₁`.\n    *   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `T₁ / T₂ = 1/2`, or `T₂ = 2 * T₁`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`. Substituting for T₂ gives `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3T₁ = 3 GeV`, so the classically calculated kinetic energy is `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Value of T₁:**\n    *   The relativistic relationship for momentum is `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`, where E is the total energy `E = T + mc²`. This can be rewritten as `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n    *   Since the momenta are equal, we can set their squared values equal: `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    *   We know `T₂ = 3 - T₁` (from the Q-value) and the rest-mass energies `m₁c² = 198 GeV` and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values into the equation (all energies in GeV):\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n        `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n        `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    *   Now, solve for T₁:\n        `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n        `600T₁ = 603`\n        `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   So, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T₁,correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Difference:**\n    *   The difference is `T₁,correct - T₁,classical`.\n    *   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n6.  **Convert to MeV:**\n    *   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is:\n    *   `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nComparing this result to the options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**1.

It is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n\n**2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nWe are given two pieces of information about the fragments:\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate the more massive fragment as `m₁`, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   The sum of the fragment rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\nIt's easier to work with rest-mass energies (`E = mc²`):\n*   From `m₁ = 2m₂`, we get `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   The sum of the final rest-mass energies is `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow we can solve this system of two equations:\n1.  Substitute the mass-energy relation into the sum: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`.\n2.  This simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`, which gives `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n3.  The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Final Rest-Mass Energy)`\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both, we can write `p² = 2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical`.\n*   This gives a ratio of kinetic energies: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Energy Sharing:** We know `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV` => `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas**\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The momentum magnitudes are still equal (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Relativistic Momentum-Energy Relation:** The relation between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Now substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6.

Determine Initial and Final Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   **Initial State**: The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State**: The nucleus splits into two fragments, a more massive one (`m1`) and a less massive one (`m2`).\n*   **Relationship 1 (Mass Ratio)**: `m1 = 2 * m2`. In terms of rest-mass energy, this is `m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²)`.\n*   **Relationship 2 (Total Final Mass)**: The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`. In terms of rest-mass energy, this is `m1*c² + m2*c² = 0.99 * (Mc²)`.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   The total rest-mass energy of the two fragments is `0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   We have a system of two equations:\n        1. `m1*c² + m2*c² = 297 GeV`\n        2. `m1*c² = 2 * m2*c²`\n    *   Substitute (2) into (1): `(2 * m2*c²) + m2*c² = 297 GeV`.\n    *   This gives `3 * m2*c² = 297 GeV`, so the rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment is `m2*c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m1*c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe energy \"lost\" from the rest-mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the Q-value of the reaction.\n*   `Q = E_initial - E_final_rest = Mc² - (m1*c² + m2*c²)`.\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate `T1` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`|p1| = |p2| = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy**: The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies `p² = 2mT`.\n*   **Finding `T1_classical`**:\n    *   Since `p²` is the same for both fragments, `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\n    *   This gives the ratio `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`, so `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substitute `T2`: `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate `T1` using the Correct Relativistic Formulas**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: The momentum magnitudes are still equal: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum-Energy Relation**: The relationship is `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc²`). An equivalent and useful form is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Finding `T1_correct`**:\n    *   Since the momentum (`p`) is the same for both fragments: `T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)`.\n    *   Substitute the known values (in GeV): `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c² = 198`, and `m2*c² = 99`.\n    *   `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    *   `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   The `T1²` terms on both sides cancel out: `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`.\n    *   Combine terms: `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`.\n    *   Solve for `T1`: `600*T1 = 603`, so `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert Units**\n*   The difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n    `Difference = T1_correct - T1_classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The question asks for the answer in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe correct answer is 5 MeV. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Initial and Final State Parameters**\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest with a rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂` (less massive).\n*   **Mass Relationship:** `m₁ = 2 * m₂`.\n*   **Sum of Final Rest Masses:** `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nFirst, we solve for the rest-mass energies of the fragments.\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`\n2.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3*(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n`m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, solve for the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`):\n`m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\nThe Q-value is the energy released during the fission, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. It's the difference between the initial rest energy and the sum of the final rest energies.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Initial Rest Energy) - (Final Rest Energy)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThe total kinetic energy shared between the fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using Classical Approximation**\nDue to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum was zero), the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n*   `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`\nIn classical physics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / (2m₁)) / (p² / (2m₂)) = m₂ / m₁`\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n*   `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T₁ using Correct Relativistic Formulas**\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum (`p`) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²` where `E = T + mc²`.\nThis can be rearranged to find momentum: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\nSince the momentum magnitudes are equal for the two fragments, we have:\n*   `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`\nFrom energy conservation, we also know that the sum of the total energies of the fragments equals the initial energy of the parent nucleus: `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`.\nLet's rearrange the momentum equation:\n*   `E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n*   `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²`\n*   `(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = 39204 GeV² - 9801 GeV² = 29403 GeV²`\n*   `E₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations:\n1.  `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`\nAdding both equations gives: `2E₁ = 398.01 GeV`, so `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\nThe kinetic energy `T₁` is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n*   `T₁_relativistic = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, we convert the result to MeV, noting that 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis result is overwhelmingly supported by the calculations of the candidate answers.

Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy (E_initial):** We are given `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy (E_final_rest):** The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy.\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Individual Fragment Energies:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`). This relationship holds for their rest-mass energies as well: `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`.\n    We can now solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`\n    Substitute (2) into (1): `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV` => `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (less massive fragment)\n    Therefore, `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (more massive fragment).\n\n### **2. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\nThe mass that is \"lost\" during the fission is converted into kinetic energy, according to the conservation of energy.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThe two fragments share a total of 3 GeV in kinetic energy.\n\n### **3. Kinetic Energy T1 (Classical Approximation)**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   This means `p² = 2m₁T₁_classical` and `p² = 2m₂T₂_classical`.\n*   Setting them equal: `2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical` => `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. So, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV` => `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Kinetic Energy T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)**\nIn relativistic mechanics, the energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc²`). We can rewrite this to solve for the momentum term: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\nSince `|p₁| = |p₂|`, their `(pc)²` values must be equal.\n`E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`\nFrom the conservation of total energy, the sum of the total energies of the fragments must equal the initial rest energy of the parent nucleus:\n`E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`.\nNow, we can solve for `E₁`:\n`E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n`(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²`\n`(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403 GeV²`\n`E₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\nWe have a new system of two equations for the total energies `E₁` and `E₂`:\n1.  `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`\nAdding the two equations: `2E₁ = 398.01 GeV` => `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\nThe relativistic kinetic energy `T₁` is the total energy `E₁` minus the rest-mass energy `m₁c²`:\n`T₁_correct = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Difference**\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\n### **6.

    "Here is a systematic, step-by-step breakdown of the solution based on the physics principles involved.\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fission Fragments**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. This means the sum of their rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy.\n    *   `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Ratio:** The more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates directly to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for Individual Energies:** We now solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`\n    Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    `2 * (m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * (m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment).\n    From this, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is:\n    `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\n\nThe energy lost in rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is known as the Q-value.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T₁` using the Classical Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the fragments fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass.\n*   **Energy Ratio:** We can find the ratio of the fragments' kinetic energies:\n    `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n    Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio `m₂ / m₁` is 1/2.\n    `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = 1/2`, which means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We use the total kinetic energy `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`:\n    `T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The momentum `p` is still the same for both fragments. The relativistic relationship connecting kinetic energy `T`, rest-mass energy `mc²`, and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `|p₁| = |p₂|`, we can equate `(p*c)²` for each fragment:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and the energy conservation relation `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    Expand both sides (all energies in GeV):\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` term appears on both sides and can be cancelled:\n    `396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n    Group the terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\nThis is the correct, relativistic value for `T₁`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct `T₁` and the classically calculated `T₁`.\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\nFinally, convert this value to MeV, knowing that `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nMatching this calculated result to the provided options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Their combined rest-mass energy is `E_final_rest = (m1 + m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Ratio:** The more massive fragment `m1` is twice the mass of `m2`, so `m1 = 2*m2`. This also means their rest-mass energies have the same ratio: `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n\nWe can now solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n`2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`3*(m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\n`m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total kinetic energy released\n\nThe energy released (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate T1 using the Classical Approximation\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite direction.\n*   Classical kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Therefore, `p^2 = 2*m1*T1_classical` and `p^2 = 2*m2*T2_classical`.\n*   Equating these gives `m1*T1_classical = m2*T2_classical`, or `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV` => `3*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate T1 using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula\n\nThe relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`.\nSince the momenta `p` are equal for both fragments:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nSubstitute the known values (`m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`) and the relation `T2 = 3 - T1` (all in GeV):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the difference\n\nThe difference is between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\nDifference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\nDifference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nConvert this to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\nDifference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers and Final Decision\n\nAlmost all candidate answers that show their work correctly derive the numerical result of 5 MeV. However, they disagree on the final letter choice because they were presented with different option lists.\n\n*   A large number of agents calculate 5 MeV but select an incorrect letter, indicating a flaw in their final selection step.\n*   A smaller, but significant, group of agents (e.g., 6, 9, 12, 13) correctly calculate 5 MeV and choose the letter `D`, which corresponds to 5 MeV in the option list they were given (`A) 2 MeV. B) 20 MeV. C) 10 MeV. D) 5 MeV.`).\n\nSince this group of agents demonstrates self-consistency between their calculation and their final choice, their answer is the most reliable. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option D in the consistent set of answers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of the provided solutions shows a strong consensus on the calculation method and the numerical result. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to confirm the correct answer.\n\n**1. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy, `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Let the rest-mass energies of the two fragments be `E1_rest = m1*c^2` (more massive) and `E2_rest = m2*c^2`.\n*   We are given `m1 = 2*m2`, which implies `E1_rest = 2*E2_rest`.\n*   We are also given that the sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n*   Therefore, `E1_rest + E2_rest = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we solve the system of equations:\n    *   `E1_rest + E2_rest = 297 GeV`\n    *   `E1_rest = 2*E2_rest`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first:\n    *   `2*E2_rest + E2_rest = 297 GeV`\n    *   `3*E2_rest = 297 GeV` => `E2_rest = 99 GeV`.\n*   And for the more massive fragment:\n    *   `E1_rest = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   This step is performed correctly by all agents that show their work.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\n*   By conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass is converted into kinetic energy (`Q`).\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (E1_rest + E2_rest)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This step is also consistently performed correctly.\n\n**3. Calculate `T1` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   Due to conservation of momentum (from an initial state of rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`|p1| = |p2| = p`).\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   Therefore, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Since `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`:\n    *   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV` => `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   All agents performing this step arrive at this correct result.\n\n**4. Calculate `T1` using the Correct Relativistic Formulas**\n\n*   Again, conservation of momentum gives `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   The relativistic relationship for momentum is `(p*c)^2 = E_total^2 - E_rest^2`, where `E_total` is the total energy (rest + kinetic).\n*   Since the momenta are equal: `E1_total^2 - E1_rest^2 = E2_total^2 - E2_rest^2`.\n*   We also know from conservation of energy that `E1_total + E2_total = E_initial = 300 GeV`, so `E2_total = 300 - E1_total`.\n*   Substituting all known values (in GeV):\n    *   `E1_total^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1_total)^2 - (99)^2`\n    *   `E1_total^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1_total + E1_total^2) - 9801`\n*   The `E1_total^2` terms cancel:\n    *   `-39204 = 80199 - 600*E1_total`\n    *   `600*E1_total = 80199 + 39204 = 119403`\n    *   `E1_total = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   The correct kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy:\n    *   `T1_correct = E1_total - E1_rest = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   This calculation is correctly performed by all agents who attempt it.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\n*   Difference = `T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Convert to MeV**\n\n*   The options are given in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. Several candidate answers show this correct calculation but then select the wrong letter choice. Based on the options provided in the prompt (`A) 5 MeV. B) 10 MeV. C) 2 MeV. D) 20 MeV.`), the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero. Its rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc²` is 300 GeV.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, with rest masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relation:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We designate the more massive one as `m₁`, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) when calculated using the correct relativistic formula versus the classical approximation.\n\n**2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nIt is most convenient to work with rest-mass energies (`mc²`).\n*   The total rest-mass energy of the two fragments is `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   The relationship `m₁ = 2m₂` translates to `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We now solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²) `\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment)\n*   And for the more massive fragment:\n    `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThe total kinetic energy shared between the fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies `p² = 2mT`.\n*   Equating the momenta: `2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical` -> `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives us `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Substitute this into the total kinetic energy equation:\n    `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship between total energy (`E = T + mc²`), momentum, and rest-mass energy is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. Rearranging gives `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n*   Since `|p₁| = |p₂|`, we have `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`. Therefore:\n    `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`\n*   From conservation of total energy, `E₁ + E₂ = E_initial = 300 GeV`. We can use this to solve the momentum equation.\n*   Rearranging the momentum equation:\n    `E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n    `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²`\n    `(E₁ - E₂) * 300 = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n    `E₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Now we have a simple system of two linear equations:\n    1.  `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`\n    2.  `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Adding the two equations: `2E₁ = 398.01 GeV` -> `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   The kinetic energy `T₁` is the total energy `E₁` minus the rest-mass energy `m₁c²`:\n    `T₁_correct = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\n**7. Convert to MeV**\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m1` (more massive) and `m2`.\n*   We are given two relationships:\n    1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   It's more convenient to work with rest-mass energies (`E = mc^2`). So, `E_m1 = 2 * E_m2` and `E_m1 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_initial`.\n*   Substituting the known `E_initial`: `E_m1 + E_m2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we solve the system of equations:\n    *   Substitute `E_m1 = 2 * E_m2` into the sum: `(2 * E_m2) + E_m2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   `3 * E_m2 = 297 GeV` => `E_m2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Then, `E_m1 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   So, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `E_m1 = 198 GeV`, and the less massive fragment is `E_m2 = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\n*   The total kinetic energy `Q` released is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = E_initial - (E_m1 + E_m2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This energy is shared between the fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)**\n\n*   The initial nucleus was at rest, so by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass: `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   This gives `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Substitute this into the total kinetic energy equation:\n    *   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_correct)**\n\n*   We still use the conservation of momentum `|p1| = |p2|`.\n*   The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, we can set their squared values equal:\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(E_m1) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(E_m2)`\n*   Substitute the known values: `E_m1 = 198 GeV`, `E_m2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms cancel out from both sides. Now, we group the terms to solve for `T1`:\n    *   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    *   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    *   `600*T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1_correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Difference**\n\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Convert to MeV**\n\n*   The options are given in MeV.

In terms of rest-mass energy, this means `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n    *   The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`. In terms of energy, this is `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2)`.\n    *   Substituting the known initial energy: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Solve for Individual Fragment Energies:** We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n    Substitute (2) into (1): `(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Energy of the less massive fragment: `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2.

Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments. Let's call them fragment 1 (more massive) and fragment 2 (less massive).\n    *   Rest masses: `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   Kinetic energies: `T₁` and `T₂`.\n    *   Momenta: `p₁` and `p₂`.\n\n### **2. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe are given two relationships:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\nWe can express these in terms of rest-mass energy (`E_rest = mc²`):\n1.  `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`.\n2.  `E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow, we solve this system of equations:\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second: `(2 * E_rest₂) + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`.\n*   This gives `3 * E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`, so `E_rest₂ = 99 GeV`.\n*   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `E_rest₁ = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **3.

Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal magnitude and opposite direction momenta: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\n*   The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   We can establish a ratio: `T₁_cl / T₂_cl = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_cl = 2 * T₁_cl`.\n*   Substitute this into the total kinetic energy equation: `T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_cl + 2*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T₁_cl = 3 GeV`, which means `T₁_cl = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate T₁ using Correct Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n\n*   Again, since momenta are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n*   `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and simplify:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, we convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the provided solutions reveals a remarkably consistent calculation process across all agents who showed their work.

Here is a breakdown of the steps, which have been verified for accuracy.\n\n**1. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus (M) is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (m1 and m2) is 99% of M. Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `(m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other (`m1 = 2 * m2`). This also means their rest-mass energies have the same relationship: `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   Solving the system of equations:\n    *   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   `3*(m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment)\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment)\n*   This step is performed correctly by all agents that show their work.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n*   The energy released is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energy, which is converted to kinetic energy (`Q = T1 + T2`).\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This step is also performed correctly by all agents.\n\n**3. Calculation of T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n*   By conservation of momentum, the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p`).\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`. This means kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, we get `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV`, which yields `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   This classical calculation is correct in all detailed solutions.\n\n**4. Calculation of T1 using Relativistic Formulas (Correct Value):**\n*   Using the conservation of momentum (`p1=p2`) with the relativistic relation `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`, we get:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   Substituting `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   Solving this equation for T1 gives:\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   This relativistic calculation is also performed correctly across the board.\n\n**5. Final Difference Calculation:**\n*   The difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n    `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Converting to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reasoning and calculation in all detailed candidate answers are correct and consistently lead to a difference of **5 MeV**. Any discrepancies in the final letter choice (e.g., A, B, D) are due to variations in the option ordering presented to each agent.

Let m₁ be the more massive one, so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This also means their rest-mass energies are related by `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`.\n    *   We now have a system of two equations:\n        1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n        2.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n    *   Substituting the second equation into the first: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Solving for `m₂c²`, we get `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    *   By conservation of energy, the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energy is released as kinetic energy (Q).\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   The total kinetic energy shared by the fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n3.  **Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n    *   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal magnitude momenta (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n    *   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    *   This means kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass: `T₁ / T₂ = m₂ / m₁`.\n    *   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `T₁ / T₂ = 1/2`, or `T₂ = 2 * T₁`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`. Substituting for T₂ gives `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3T₁ = 3 GeV`, so the classically calculated kinetic energy is `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Value of T₁:**\n    *   The relativistic relationship for momentum is `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`, where E is the total energy `E = T + mc²`. This can be rewritten as `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n    *   Since the momenta are equal, we can set their squared values equal: `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    *   We know `T₂ = 3 - T₁` (from the Q-value) and the rest-mass energies `m₁c² = 198 GeV` and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values into the equation (all energies in GeV):\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n        `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n        `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    *   Now, solve for T₁:\n        `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n        `600T₁ = 603`\n        `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   So, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T₁,correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Difference:**\n    *   The difference is `T₁,correct - T₁,classical`.\n    *   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n6.  **Convert to MeV:**\n    *   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is:\n    *   `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nComparing this result to the options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. It is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n\n**2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nWe are given two pieces of information about the fragments:\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate the more massive fragment as `m₁`, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   The sum of the fragment rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\nIt's easier to work with rest-mass energies (`E = mc²`):\n*   From `m₁ = 2m₂`, we get `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   The sum of the final rest-mass energies is `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow we can solve this system of two equations:\n1.  Substitute the mass-energy relation into the sum: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`.\n2.  This simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`, which gives `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n3.  The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Final Rest-Mass Energy)`\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both, we can write `p² = 2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical`.\n*   This gives a ratio of kinetic energies: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Energy Sharing:** We know `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV` => `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas**\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The momentum magnitudes are still equal (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Relativistic Momentum-Energy Relation:** The relation between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Now substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, convert this difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem and determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Determine Initial and Final Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   **Initial State**: The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State**: The nucleus splits into two fragments, a more massive one (`m1`) and a less massive one (`m2`).\n*   **Relationship 1 (Mass Ratio)**: `m1 = 2 * m2`. In terms of rest-mass energy, this is `m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²)`.\n*   **Relationship 2 (Total Final Mass)**: The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`. In terms of rest-mass energy, this is `m1*c² + m2*c² = 0.99 * (Mc²)`.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   The total rest-mass energy of the two fragments is `0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   We have a system of two equations:\n        1. `m1*c² + m2*c² = 297 GeV`\n        2. `m1*c² = 2 * m2*c²`\n    *   Substitute (2) into (1): `(2 * m2*c²) + m2*c² = 297 GeV`.\n    *   This gives `3 * m2*c² = 297 GeV`, so the rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment is `m2*c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m1*c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe energy \"lost\" from the rest-mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the Q-value of the reaction.\n*   `Q = E_initial - E_final_rest = Mc² - (m1*c² + m2*c²)`.\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate `T1` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`|p1| = |p2| = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy**: The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies `p² = 2mT`.\n*   **Finding `T1_classical`**:\n    *   Since `p²` is the same for both fragments, `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\n    *   This gives the ratio `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`, so `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substitute `T2`: `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate `T1` using the Correct Relativistic Formulas**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: The momentum magnitudes are still equal: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum-Energy Relation**: The relationship is `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc²`). An equivalent and useful form is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Finding `T1_correct`**:\n    *   Since the momentum (`p`) is the same for both fragments: `T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)`.\n    *   Substitute the known values (in GeV): `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c² = 198`, and `m2*c² = 99`.\n    *   `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    *   `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   The `T1²` terms on both sides cancel out: `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`.\n    *   Combine terms: `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`.\n    *   Solve for `T1`: `600*T1 = 603`, so `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert Units**\n*   The difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n    `Difference = T1_correct - T1_classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The question asks for the answer in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe correct answer is 5 MeV. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Initial and Final State Parameters**\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest with a rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂` (less massive).\n*   **Mass Relationship:** `m₁ = 2 * m₂`.\n*   **Sum of Final Rest Masses:** `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nFirst, we solve for the rest-mass energies of the fragments.\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`\n2.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3*(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n`m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, solve for the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`):\n`m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\nThe Q-value is the energy released during the fission, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. It's the difference between the initial rest energy and the sum of the final rest energies.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Initial Rest Energy) - (Final Rest Energy)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThe total kinetic energy shared between the fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using Classical Approximation**\nDue to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum was zero), the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n*   `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`\nIn classical physics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / (2m₁)) / (p² / (2m₂)) = m₂ / m₁`\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n*   `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T₁ using Correct Relativistic Formulas**\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum (`p`) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²` where `E = T + mc²`.\nThis can be rearranged to find momentum: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\nSince the momentum magnitudes are equal for the two fragments, we have:\n*   `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`\nFrom energy conservation, we also know that the sum of the total energies of the fragments equals the initial energy of the parent nucleus: `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`.\nLet's rearrange the momentum equation:\n*   `E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n*   `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²`\n*   `(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = 39204 GeV² - 9801 GeV² = 29403 GeV²`\n*   `E₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations:\n1.  `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`\nAdding both equations gives: `2E₁ = 398.01 GeV`, so `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\nThe kinetic energy `T₁` is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n*   `T₁_relativistic = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, we convert the result to MeV, noting that 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis result is overwhelmingly supported by the calculations of the candidate answers.

Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy (E_initial):** We are given `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy (E_final_rest):** The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy.\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Individual Fragment Energies:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`). This relationship holds for their rest-mass energies as well: `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`.\n    We can now solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`\n    Substitute (2) into (1): `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV` => `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (less massive fragment)\n    Therefore, `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (more massive fragment).\n\n### **2. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\nThe mass that is \"lost\" during the fission is converted into kinetic energy, according to the conservation of energy.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThe two fragments share a total of 3 GeV in kinetic energy.\n\n### **3. Kinetic Energy T1 (Classical Approximation)**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   This means `p² = 2m₁T₁_classical` and `p² = 2m₂T₂_classical`.\n*   Setting them equal: `2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical` => `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. So, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV` => `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Kinetic Energy T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)**\nIn relativistic mechanics, the energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc²`). We can rewrite this to solve for the momentum term: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\nSince `|p₁| = |p₂|`, their `(pc)²` values must be equal.\n`E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`\nFrom the conservation of total energy, the sum of the total energies of the fragments must equal the initial rest energy of the parent nucleus:\n`E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`.\nNow, we can solve for `E₁`:\n`E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n`(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²`\n`(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403 GeV²`\n`E₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\nWe have a new system of two equations for the total energies `E₁` and `E₂`:\n1.  `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`\nAdding the two equations: `2E₁ = 398.01 GeV` => `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\nThe relativistic kinetic energy `T₁` is the total energy `E₁` minus the rest-mass energy `m₁c²`:\n`T₁_correct = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Difference**\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\n### **6.
