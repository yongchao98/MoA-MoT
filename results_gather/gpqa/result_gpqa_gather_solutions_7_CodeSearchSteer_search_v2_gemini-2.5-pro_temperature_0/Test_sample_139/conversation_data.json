Converting to Celsius (K - 273.15), this is approximately 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), which is a near-perfect match. This also identifies the \"heavier isotope\" as Deuterium (D).\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given the context of deuterium, Deuterium gas (D₂) is the most logical candidate. A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms; each atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The problem states X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also common. This points to a pair of reagents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The reaction of X with a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol (which has 2 oxygen atoms). LiAlH₄ is a strong enough reducing agent for this; its analog, LiAlD₄, would be as well.\n    *   The reaction of X with liquid Y (which must be D₂O to produce D₂ gas) is violent and forms a precipitate G. The reaction `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂` fits all criteria: it's violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose, releasing D₂O (B). This completes the puzzle.\n    *   Therefore, Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35.\n    *   The options are: A) 25, B) 31, C) 35, D) 29.\n    *   The correct option is C.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly identified the substance and performed the calculation to get 35, many made an error in selecting the corresponding letter option.

The key steps of this deduction are:\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B**: The melting point of B is given as \"very close to 277 K\". This is approximately 3.85 °C. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), especially when contrasted with normal water's melting point of 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly indicates that **B is D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W**: Gas W's molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given the context of deuterium, deuterium gas (D₂) is the most logical candidate. A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms; each atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons in the molecule. This fits the description perfectly.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance X**: The clues point to X being a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry.\n    *   Its reaction with a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This implies the reduction of both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups, forming a diol. This requires a strong reducing agent.\n    *   The most common strong reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing the heavy isotope deuterium is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) is violent and produces the identified products: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → Al(OD)₃ (Precipitate G) + LiOD + 4D₂ (Gas W)`.\n    *   The precipitate G (Aluminum deuteroxide) decomposes upon heating to release D₂O (Substance B).\n    *   All clues consistently and unequivocally point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe final step is to calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element**: Hydrogen (atomic number Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element**: Aluminum (atomic number Z=13).\n*   **Instruction**: Sum the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The mass of the lightest element's atoms: There are four atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   The mass of the heaviest element's atoms: There is one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27. The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum**: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe logical deduction and calculation performed by the majority of the agents are correct. The final calculated value is 35. The provided options are A) 31, B) 29, C) 35, and D) 25. The calculated value of 35 matches option C. While many of the candidate answers selected the wrong letter, their underlying reasoning and calculation were sound and pointed to the value 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this chemical puzzle step-by-step to identify the unknown \"Substance X\" and then perform the required calculation.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The clue states that the melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius (K - 273.15), we get approximately 3.85 °C. This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly suggests that B is D₂O and the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. Since we know deuterium is involved, let's check deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which fits the description perfectly.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** We have several clues about X:\n    *   It contains the heavier isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It's a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also common.\n    *   It reacts violently with a liquid (Y) to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate (G).\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a powerful reducing agent, capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol (which has 2 oxygen atoms).\n    *   A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues. It reacts violently with heavy water (Y = D₂O) to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate of aluminum deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃). Heating G would release D₂O (B).\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** Now that Substance X is identified as LiAlD₄, I will calculate the cumulative atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements.

Deconstruction of Clues and Identification of Substances**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Substance B's Melting Point:** The melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C (277 - 273.15).\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also tells us the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is deuterium.\n\n*   **Clue 2: Gas W's Properties:** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Given that deuterium is involved, let's check deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Clue 3: The Reaction and Precipitate G:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\n    *   The decomposition of G to release D₂O suggests G is a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n    *   The overall reaction produces D₂ and a metal deuteroxide. This points to a reaction between a metal deuteride (X) and heavy water (Y).\n    *   Reaction: Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W). This type of reaction is often violent.\n\n*   **Clue 4: Substance X in Organic Chemistry:**\n    *   X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This suggests a common reagent and its isotopically labeled version.\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a powerful reducing agent, capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol (which has 2 oxygen atoms).\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits all the clues for Substance X.\n\n**2. Verification of the Entire Sequence**\n\n*   Let **X = LiAlD₄**.\n*   Let **Y = D₂O**.\n*   The reaction is: **LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂**.\n*   This reaction is violent.\n*   The gas produced is **W = D₂**, which has equal protons and neutrons.\n*   A precipitate, **G = Al(OD)₃**, is formed.\n*   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) causes decomposition: **2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O**. This releases **B = D₂O**, which has a melting point near 277 K.\n*   All clues are consistent.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We use integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of D is 2.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   Sum = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Identification of the Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B:** The clue states the melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is approximately 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavy isotope of hydrogen (Deuterium, D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a near-perfect match.\n    *   This strongly indicates that **B is D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The clue states that a molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   Given that Deuterium is involved, Deuterium gas (D₂) is a prime candidate.\n    *   A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Thus, **W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of X.\n    *   It contains a heavy isotope (Deuterium).\n    *   It reacts violently with a liquid (Y) to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate (G). This suggests X is a metal deuteride and Y is D₂O.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also common. This points to a common reducing agent like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) with X produces a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid to alcohol groups, forming a diol, which has 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms X is a strong reducing agent.\n    *   Let's test the reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`. This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide (G). Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B).\n    *   All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**2. Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄). The problem specifies to sum the masses of all atoms of these elements. We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved, as implied by the integer answer choices.\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Sum the masses:**\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D).

Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated value is 35. The provided options are:\nA) 29\nB) 31\nC) 25\nD) 35\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance B**\n\nThe first key clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   This is an excellent match, strongly indicating that **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is deuterium.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas W**\n\nThe problem states that a molecule of gas W contains an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given that deuterium is involved in the reaction (as established from the identity of B), the most logical candidate for gas W is deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A deuterium atom (²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n\n**3. Identification of Substance X**\n\nSeveral clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n*   **Organic Chemistry Reagent:** X and its \"very close analog\" are used in organic chemistry. This points to a common reagent pair, likely a standard reagent and its isotopically labeled version.\n*   **Strong Reducing Agent:** The reaction of a keto acid (which contains 3 oxygen atoms in its ketone and carboxylic acid groups) with X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a reduction of both functional groups to alcohols, forming a diol. This type of reaction requires a powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Identity:** The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues: it contains the heavy isotope deuterium, its analog (LiAlH₄) is extremely common, and it is a strong reducing agent.\n\n**4. Verification of the Entire Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that X = LiAlD₄.\n*   The reaction is described as X reacting violently with a liquid Y. If X is LiAlD₄, Y must be a deuterium source to produce the observed products. The most logical choice for liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   This reaction is known to be violent.\n*   It produces D₂ gas (W), which matches our earlier deduction.\n*   It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate (G).\n*   When the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes to form aluminum oxide and heavy water: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B). This is consistent with the clues.\n*   All clues point unambiguously to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number Z=13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D or ²H), with a mass number of **2**.\n    *   The stable isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum (²⁷Al), with a mass number of **27**.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms of Deuterium (D₄). The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one atom of Aluminum. The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis calculated value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Chemical Puzzle\nThe core of the task is to solve a chemical riddle to identify \"Substance X\" and then perform a calculation based on its composition.\n\n*   **Clue 1: Substance B's Melting Point.** The melting point is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C (277 - 273.15).\n    *   This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This strongly indicates that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D), and that **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Clue 2: Gas W's Properties.** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   Given that Deuterium is involved, Deuterium gas (D₂) is the most logical candidate. A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Clue 3: The Reaction.** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\n    *   This reaction sequence is characteristic of a reactive metal deuteride reacting with heavy water.\n    *   X (Metal Deuteride) + Y (D₂O) → G (Metal Deuteroxide) + W (D₂)\n    *   Heating G (Metal Deuteroxide) → Metal Oxide + B (D₂O)\n    *   This confirms that **Liquid Y is D₂O** and **Precipitate G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n\n*   **Clue 4: Identifying Substance X.**\n    *   X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is very common. This points to a common reducing agent like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) with X produces a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent that can reduce both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol (which has 2 oxygen atoms). This confirms X is a strong reducing agent.\n    *   Let's test X = LiAlD₄ in the main reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n    *   This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃). Heating Al(OD)₃ produces Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B).

We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D or ²H), with a mass number of **2**.\n    *   The isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum-27 (²⁷Al), with a mass number of **27**.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.**\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\nThe step-by-step analysis consistently leads to a calculated value of 35.

Identification of the Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B:** The clue states that the melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting to Celsius (K - 273.15), this is approximately 3.85 °C. This value is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This strongly indicates that **B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is deuterium (D).\n\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that deuterium is involved, the most logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n\n*   **Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of X:\n    *   It contains a heavy isotope (deuterium).\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent\". This points to a common reagent pair, like a deuterated compound and its standard version.\n    *   It reacts with a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) to yield a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a powerful reducing agent, capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols, thus forming a diol (which has 2 oxygen atoms).\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues.\n\n*   **Liquid Y and Precipitate G:** The reaction of X (LiAlD₄) with a liquid Y is violent and produces gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. For the reaction to produce D₂, the liquid Y must be a deuterium source, making it **heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction is:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    In this reaction, Aluminum Deuteroxide (**Al(OD)₃**) is the precipitate G. When G is heated, it decomposes to release D₂O (Substance B), which is consistent with the clues: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n\n**2. Final Calculation**\n\nThe task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Sum of Masses:** The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** The final value is the sum of these masses.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\n**3.

This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This strongly indicates **B is D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n\n*   **Gas W:** The clue states that a molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that deuterium is involved, the most logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, satisfying the condition. So, **W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of X:\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope (Deuterium).\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent\".

Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n*   **Reaction Confirmation:** Let's assume X is LiAlD₄. It reacts violently with liquid Y. To produce D₂ gas, Y must be a deuterium source, making **Y = D₂O**. The reaction is:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It produces Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a precipitate (G).\n    *   When G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B).\n    *   All clues are consistent. **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n**2.

This is approximately 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), which is a near-perfect match. This strongly indicates that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Gas W's Properties:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that Deuterium is involved, Deuterium gas (D₂) is the most logical candidate. A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Reaction Sequence:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases substance B (D₂O). This sequence is characteristic of a reactive metal deuteride (X) reacting with heavy water (Y) to form a metal deuteroxide (G), which then decomposes upon heating.\n    *   **Identity of Substance X:** The clues from organic chemistry are key. X is a reagent, and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent\". The reaction of X with a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms.

Identification of Substance B**\nThe first key clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n*   The melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O) is 3.82 °C.\n*   This is an excellent match, strongly indicating that **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n\n**2. Identification of Gas W**\nThe problem states that the molecule of gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given that we have identified Deuterium in the problem, the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A single Deuterium atom (²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   This perfectly fits the description, so **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**3. Identification of Substance X**\nWe have several clues about Substance X:\n*   It contains a heavier isotope (Deuterium).\n*   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also a common reagent.\n*   It reacts with a keto acid (which contains 3 oxygen atoms) to produce a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.

This is a near-unanimous conclusion among the agents and is chemically sound.\n*   **Identification of Gas W:** The clue that gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons, combined with the context of heavy water, points directly to deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is also a consensus finding.\n*   **Identification of Substance X:** The clues converge on Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   It contains a heavy isotope (Deuterium).\n    *   Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, is an extremely common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n    *   As a strong reducing agent, it would reduce a keto acid (3 oxygens) to a diol (2 oxygens), matching the clue.\n    *   Its reaction with heavy water (Y=D₂O) is violent and produces the correct products: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W)`.\n    *   The precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would release B (D₂O) upon heating.\n    *   This identification is robust and agreed upon by nearly every agent that provided detailed reasoning.\n\n**2.

This is approximately 3.85 °C. This value is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a strong indication that **B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D). All detailed candidate answers correctly identified this.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W:** The clue for gas W is that its molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Chemical Puzzle\n\nThe problem is a multi-step chemical riddle. The most logical approach is to identify each unknown substance based on the clues provided.\n\n*   **Identification of Substance B:** The first key clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is an excellent match, strongly indicating that **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is deuterium.\n\n*   **Identification of Gas W:** The problem states that a molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Given that deuterium is involved in the reaction, the most logical candidate for gas W is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n\n*   **Identification of Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Reagent:** X and its \"very close analog\" are used in organic chemistry. This points to a common reagent and its isotopically labeled version.\n    *   **Strong Reducing Agent:** The reaction of a keto acid (which contains 3 oxygen atoms in its ketone and carboxylic acid groups) with X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a reduction of both functional groups to alcohols, forming a diol. This type of reaction requires a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   **Identity:** The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues: it contains the heavy isotope deuterium, its analog (LiAlH₄) is extremely common, and it is a strong reducing agent.\n\n*   **Verification of the Entire Reaction Sequence:** Let's test the hypothesis that X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   The reaction is described as X reacting violently with a liquid Y. If X is LiAlD₄, Y must be a deuterium source to produce the observed products. The most logical choice for liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W) and a gelatinous precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). When the precipitate G is heated, it decomposes to release D₂O (B). This is consistent with all the clues.\n    *   Therefore, all evidence unambiguously points to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n### 2. Final Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number Z=13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved, as implied by the integer answer choices.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D or ²H), with a mass number of **2**.\n    *   The stable isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum (²⁷Al), with a mass number of **27**.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms of Deuterium (D₄). The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one atom of Aluminum. The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step analysis of the chemical properties correctly identifies Substance X as LiAlD₄. The calculation based on the atomic masses of the lightest (4 atoms of Deuterium) and heaviest (1 atom of Aluminum) elements yields a cumulative mass of 35.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 25\nB) 35\nC) 31\nD) 29\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The key steps of this deduction are:\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B**: The melting point of B is given as \"very close to 277 K\". This is approximately 3.85 °C. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), especially when contrasted with normal water's melting point of 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly indicates that **B is D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W**: Gas W's molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given the context of deuterium, deuterium gas (D₂) is the most logical candidate.

Converting this to Celsius (K - 273.15), we get approximately 3.85 °C. This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly suggests that B is D₂O and the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. Since we know deuterium is involved, let's check deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.

This implies a reduction of both functional groups to alcohols, forming a diol. This type of reaction requires a powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Identity:** The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues: it contains the heavy isotope deuterium, its analog (LiAlH₄) is extremely common, and it is a strong reducing agent.\n\n**4. Verification of the Entire Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that X = LiAlD₄.\n*   The reaction is described as X reacting violently with a liquid Y. If X is LiAlD₄, Y must be a deuterium source to produce the observed products. The most logical choice for liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   This reaction is known to be violent.\n*   It produces D₂ gas (W), which matches our earlier deduction.\n*   It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate (G).\n*   When the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes to form aluminum oxide and heavy water: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B). This is consistent with the clues.\n*   All clues point unambiguously to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number Z=13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D or ²H), with a mass number of **2**.\n    *   The stable isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum (²⁷Al), with a mass number of **27**.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms of Deuterium (D₄). The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one atom of Aluminum. The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis calculated value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Chemical Puzzle\nThe core of the task is to solve a chemical riddle to identify \"Substance X\" and then perform a calculation based on its composition.\n\n*   **Clue 1: Substance B's Melting Point.** The melting point is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C (277 - 273.15).\n    *   This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This strongly indicates that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D), and that **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Clue 2: Gas W's Properties.** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   Given that Deuterium is involved, Deuterium gas (D₂) is the most logical candidate. A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Clue 3: The Reaction.** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\n    *   This reaction sequence is characteristic of a reactive metal deuteride reacting with heavy water.\n    *   X (Metal Deuteride) + Y (D₂O) → G (Metal Deuteroxide) + W (D₂)\n    *   Heating G (Metal Deuteroxide) → Metal Oxide + B (D₂O)\n    *   This confirms that **Liquid Y is D₂O** and **Precipitate G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n\n*   **Clue 4: Identifying Substance X.**\n    *   X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is very common. This points to a common reducing agent like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) with X produces a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent that can reduce both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol (which has 2 oxygen atoms). This confirms X is a strong reducing agent.\n    *   Let's test X = LiAlD₄ in the main reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n    *   This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃). Heating Al(OD)₃ produces Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). All clues are consistent.\n\n### Step 2: Perform the Calculation\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Lightest Element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number):** Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Instruction:** Sum the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D or ²H), with a mass number of **2**.\n    *   The isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum-27 (²⁷Al), with a mass number of **27**.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.**\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\nThe step-by-step analysis consistently leads to a calculated value of 35. The provided options are A) 29, B) 31, C) 35, and D) 25. The calculated value of 35 matches option C.\n\nWhile many of the candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis and calculation, several made an error in matching the final number (35) to the correct letter option. The correct reasoning leads to the number 35, which is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Identification of the Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B:** The clue states that the melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting to Celsius (K - 273.15), this is approximately 3.85 °C. This value is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This strongly indicates that **B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is deuterium (D).\n\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that deuterium is involved, the most logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n\n*   **Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of X:\n    *   It contains a heavy isotope (deuterium).\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent\". This points to a common reagent pair, like a deuterated compound and its standard version.\n    *   It reacts with a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) to yield a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a powerful reducing agent, capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols, thus forming a diol (which has 2 oxygen atoms).\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues.\n\n*   **Liquid Y and Precipitate G:** The reaction of X (LiAlD₄) with a liquid Y is violent and produces gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. For the reaction to produce D₂, the liquid Y must be a deuterium source, making it **heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction is:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    In this reaction, Aluminum Deuteroxide (**Al(OD)₃**) is the precipitate G. When G is heated, it decomposes to release D₂O (Substance B), which is consistent with the clues: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n\n**2. Final Calculation**\n\nThe task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Sum of Masses:** The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** The final value is the sum of these masses.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\n**3.

Given that deuterium is involved, the most logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, satisfying the condition. So, **W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of X:\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope (Deuterium).\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent\".

There are four D atoms.\n    *   The isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum (²⁷Al), with a mass number of 27. There is one Al atom.\n\n*   **Summation:**\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 = 8\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 atom × 27 = 27\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35.

Identification of Substance B**\nThe first key clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n*   The melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O) is 3.82 °C.\n*   This is an excellent match, strongly indicating that **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n\n**2. Identification of Gas W**\nThe problem states that the molecule of gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given that we have identified Deuterium in the problem, the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A single Deuterium atom (²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   This perfectly fits the description, so **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**3. Identification of Substance X**\nWe have several clues about Substance X:\n*   It contains a heavier isotope (Deuterium).\n*   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also a common reagent.\n*   It reacts with a keto acid (which contains 3 oxygen atoms) to produce a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a powerful reducing agent, capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups, thus forming a diol (which has 2 oxygen atoms).\n*   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).

This is a near-unanimous conclusion among the agents and is chemically sound.\n*   **Identification of Gas W:** The clue that gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons, combined with the context of heavy water, points directly to deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is also a consensus finding.\n*   **Identification of Substance X:** The clues converge on Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   It contains a heavy isotope (Deuterium).\n    *   Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, is an extremely common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n    *   As a strong reducing agent, it would reduce a keto acid (3 oxygens) to a diol (2 oxygens), matching the clue.\n    *   Its reaction with heavy water (Y=D₂O) is violent and produces the correct products: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W)`.\n    *   The precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would release B (D₂O) upon heating.\n    *   This identification is robust and agreed upon by nearly every agent that provided detailed reasoning.\n\n**2.

Using integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes:\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the stable isotope is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n**3. Conclusion from Candidate Answers**\n\n*   **Reasoning and Calculation Consensus:** There is a strong consensus among the agents (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) that the substance is LiAlD₄ and the calculated value is 35.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Selection:** A significant number of agents, despite correctly calculating the value 35, selected an incorrect final letter (e.g., A, C, or D).

Assuming the options are A=29, B=35, C=25, D=31, the correct choice is B.\n\nBased on the overwhelming consensus in the chemical reasoning and the numerical calculation, the correct answer is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and the problem statement, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Chemical Puzzle\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B:** The clue states the melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\". This is approximately 3.85 °C. This value is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a strong indication that **B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D). All detailed candidate answers correctly identified this.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W:** The clue for gas W is that its molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given the context of deuterium, deuterium gas (D₂) is the most logical candidate. A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly. All candidate answers correctly deduced this.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance X:**\n    *   **Reaction Context:** Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields B (D₂O). This points to a reaction between a metal deuteride (X) and heavy water (Y), producing a metal deuteroxide (G) and deuterium gas (W).\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Context:** X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is very common. Its reaction with a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The most fitting candidate for X is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, is an extremely common and powerful reducing agent. The reaction `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W)` is consistent with all clues.

We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D), with a mass number of 2. There are four such atoms.\n    *   The isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum-27 (²⁷Al), with a mass number of 27. There is one such atom.\n*   **Summation:**\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe chemical analysis across almost all candidate answers is correct and leads to the identification of Substance X as LiAlD₄. The calculation based on this identification consistently yields a result of 35. The provided options are A) 35, B) 29, C) 31, D) 25.\n\nThe calculated value of 35 directly corresponds to option A. Several candidate answers correctly performed the calculation but made a simple error in matching the number 35 to the correct letter option. The reasoning and calculation are sound, and the correct answer is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core of the task is to solve a chemical puzzle to identify \"Substance X\" and then perform a specific calculation based on its atomic composition.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The clue states the melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is approximately 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavy isotope of hydrogen (Deuterium, D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a near-perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also identifies the \"heavier isotope\" as Deuterium.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The clue states that a molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   Given that the reaction involves deuterium, the most logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of X.\n    *   **Reaction:** X reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. Since G releases D₂O (B) upon heating, G must be a metal deuteroxide. The overall reaction is characteristic of a reactive metal deuteride reacting with heavy water (Y = D₂O).\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Context:** X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is common. It reduces a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol (which has 2 oxygen atoms).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The most common powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits every single clue. It is a powerful reducing agent, its analog is common, it contains deuterium, and its reaction with heavy water (`LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`) produces D₂ gas and a precipitate of aluminum deuteroxide (G).\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe final step is to calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest element (by atomic number):** Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms: There are four atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atoms: There is one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe logical deduction overwhelmingly points to LiAlD₄ as Substance X, and the subsequent calculation yields a value of 35. The provided options are A) 31, B) 29, C) 35, and D) 25. The calculated value of 35 matches option C.\n\nWhile many of the candidate answers correctly perform the deduction and calculation, they often fail to map the result of 35 to the correct letter option. The correct reasoning and calculation lead to the value 35, which is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance B**\nThe first key clue is that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   This is an excellent match, and it aligns with the clue that Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope\". Therefore, Substance B is D₂O.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas W**\nGas W's molecule contains an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that deuterium is involved in the reaction (as established from identifying B as D₂O), the most logical candidate for W is deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\nThis fits the description perfectly.\n\n**3. Identification of Substance X**\nMultiple clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n*   **Organic Chemistry Reagent:** X and its \"very close analog\" are used in organic chemistry. This suggests a common reagent family.\n*   **Reducing Agent:** The reaction of X with a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms, e.g., R-CO-COOH) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates a reduction reaction where both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups are reduced to alcohols, forming a diol (which has 2 oxygen atoms). This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n*   **Identity:** The most common strong reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Reaction Confirmation:** Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits the reaction description. The reaction of a strong deuteride with heavy water (Y = D₂O) is violent and proceeds as follows:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a precipitate (G).\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) causes it to decompose, releasing D₂O (B): 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\nAll clues consistently confirm that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nThe task is to calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The instructions clarify that if multiple atoms of an element exist, all their masses must be summed.\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   **Masses of Isotopes:** We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved: the mass number of Deuterium (D) is 2, and the mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum (Al) is 27.\n\n*   **Sum the mass of all atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen):**\n    There are four atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄.\n    Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n\n*   **Sum the mass of all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminum):**\n    There is one atom of Aluminum (Al) in LiAlD₄.\n    Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n*   **Calculate the cumulative mass:**\n    Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Total mass from Aluminum isotopes)\n    Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
