Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\n\nA) 12\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 22\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z**: The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Carbon Skeleton**: The fact that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane) is a critical clue. It means that all the compounds in both mixtures have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**:\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   The other component must also have a C₆ ring skeleton and not decolorize bromine water. Upon hydrogenation, it must yield cyclohexane. The only compound that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and thus unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction and Find the Answer**:\n    *   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   The reaction is: `Mixture X (X₁ + X₂) → Mixture Y (C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆)`.\n    *   Since the starting mixture X and the resulting mixture Y are both equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all components.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation. We can balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n        *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Verification (Optional but Recommended)**:\n    *   The components of X must be unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆ cyclic compounds.\n    *   We need two such compounds whose hydrogen counts sum to 18.\n    *   The logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water. 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. This scenario fits all the problem's conditions.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Our calculation shows this to be 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** A mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28% is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The empirical formula is CH₂.\n*   The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The fact that it is a widely used solvent, and all reactions center around it, strongly suggests it is the most common and stable example, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification is consistent across all provided analyses.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** Since one component is cyclohexane, the other component must also not decolorize bromine water and must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The only common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and thus unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, but it hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   The formation of Y by disproportionation (a hydrogen transfer) also supports this, as a cycloalkane (fully hydrogenated) and an aromatic ring (fully dehydrogenated) are the logical products.\n*   Therefore, **Mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This conclusion is also unanimous among the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Properties of Mixture X\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** Let the two components of mixture X be A and B. The reaction is:\n    `A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Analysis (Conservation of Atoms):** The total number of atoms must be conserved. Since hydrogenation of X yields only cyclohexane, both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton. Let their formulas be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ. To balance the hydrogen atoms in the reaction:\n    `a + b = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene)`\n    `a + b = 18`\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is precisely the sum `a + b`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two components of mixture X is 18. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of atoms in the established chemical reaction.\n\nThis conclusion can be further verified by identifying the components of X. They must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), non-conjugated C₆ cyclic compounds. The only pair that fits is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, confirming the result.\n\nAll provided analyses correctly follow this logical path and arrive at the number 18. The discrepancies in the final letter choices of some candidates appear to be clerical errors. The correct numerical answer is 18.\n\nBased on the options provided:\nA) 18\nB) 16\nC) 12\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by systematically deducing the identity of each substance and mixture based on the chemical properties described.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z**: I will use the given mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) to determine the empirical formula of Z. Combined with the information that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon and a common solvent, I can deduce its exact molecular formula and structure.\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y**: Knowing that Z is a component of Y, and that Y does not decolorize bromine water but hydrogenates completely to Z, I can identify the second component of Y. The disproportionation reaction type strongly suggests the second component is the aromatic counterpart to Z.\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer**: The reaction where mixture X forms mixture Y is a disproportionation, which is a hydrogen transfer in this case. By applying the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules from mixture X must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules of mixture Y. This calculation will directly answer the question.\n4.  **Code Implementation**: The Python code will perform the final calculation based on the deduced components of mixture Y, thereby finding the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry problem by deducing the components\n    and using the law of conservation of atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Deduce the components of Mixture Y.\n    # From the problem description:\n    # - Substance Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% (approx. 1/7),\n    #   is saturated, and is a common solvent.

It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** A mass fraction of 14.28% is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since Z is saturated, it cannot be an alkene. Therefore, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The fact that it's a widely used solvent strongly suggests it is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, the most common cycloalkane solvent. This fits all the criteria.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Carbon Skeleton**\n*   **Information:** Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a critical point. It means that every compound in both mixtures must have a six-carbon ring as its fundamental structure.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). It is formed by a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, its components must be saturated or aromatic. We know one component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ ring skeleton and not react with bromine water. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Let's check the hydrogenation: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. So, hydrogenating the mixture {cyclohexane, benzene} gives only cyclohexane. This fits perfectly.\n*   The formation via disproportionation (a hydrogen transfer) also makes sense: a more hydrogenated species (cyclohexane) and a less hydrogenated species (benzene) are formed.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y consists of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X and Solve the Problem**\n*   **Information:** X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that reacts to form Y. X decolorizes bromine water (so its components are unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction is: `Mixture X → Mixture Y`. Since both are equimolar mixtures, we can write the reaction for one molecule of each component:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms on the left side must equal the total on the right side.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of X₁ and one of X₂) must also be **18**.\n*   **Verification:** We can identify plausible structures for X₁ and X₂. They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds. The best candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and have a C₆ ring.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is not conjugated (unlike its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This confirms our calculation.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer, which is a known type of disproportionation over a platinum catalyst.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. As determined by the conservation of atoms in the reaction `X → Y`, this is the sum of hydrogen atoms in the products, cyclohexane (12 H) and benzene (6 H).\nTotal H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 22\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 12\n\nThe correct answer is 18, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n*   Let the molecular formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen can be approximated using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) as `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 1/7: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` which gives `7y = 12x + y`, simplifying to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states Z is \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and stable cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits all the given information. So, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Determine the Carbon Skeleton of All Components**\n\n*   A crucial piece of information is that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n*   This implies that all the chemical compounds in both mixtures have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring.\n\n**3. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. This type of reaction typically converts an unsaturated cyclic compound into a mixture of a fully saturated cycloalkane and a fully dehydrogenated aromatic compound.\n*   Given that one product is cyclohexane (the saturated C₆ ring), the other product must be benzene (C₆H₆), the aromatic C₆ ring.\n*   Let's check if this fits: Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n    *   It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Neither cyclohexane (saturated) nor benzene (aromatic) decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Hydrogenation of this mixture would convert benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only cyclohexane as the final product.\n*   This fits all conditions perfectly. So, **Mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and benzene**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer**\n\n*   The reaction is the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y:\n    `Mixture X → Mixture Y`\n*   Since both are equimolar mixtures and all components have a C₆ skeleton, we can write the reaction for one molecule of each component:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms on the reactant side must equal the total number on the product side.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂) must also be 18.\n*   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X,\" which is precisely this sum.\n\n**Verification (Optional but Recommended):**\nWe can identify the components of X.

This confirms our result.\n*   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n*   1,4-cyclohexadiene is not conjugated (unlike its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n*   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a known catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   Let the molecular formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. This type of reaction typically converts an unsaturated cyclic compound into a mixture of a fully saturated cycloalkane and a fully unsaturated aromatic compound.\n*   Therefore, the other component of Y is likely the aromatic equivalent of cyclohexane, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   Let's check if this fits:\n    *   Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n    *   Neither component decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Hydrogenation of this mixture would convert benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only cyclohexane (Z) as the final product. This matches the problem description.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Identify Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that, upon heating with platinum, disproportionates to form mixture Y.\n*   The overall reaction is: `Component of X₁ + Component of X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`.\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**4. Verify the Properties of Mixture X**\n*   The components of X decolorize bromine water (they are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane, so both components must have a C₆ ring skeleton.\n*   We need two C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The sum of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds and is not conjugated (ruling out the 1,3-isomer).\n    *   This pair of compounds perfectly fits all the conditions described for mixture X.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the atom balance from the disproportionation reaction, this sum is 18. This is confirmed by identifying the likely components of mixture X as cyclohexene (10 hydrogens) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8 hydrogens), which sum to 18.\n\nThe correct option is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits all the given information.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   The hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z. This means the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a typical alkene. The most plausible candidate is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton: benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum in a disproportionation reaction. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall reaction is: `Mixture X (X₁ + X₂) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`.\n*   Since the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written as: `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`.\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n**4. Verification of the Components of Mixture X**\n*   To ensure this is a valid chemical scenario, we can identify the components of X.\n*   They must be C₆ cyclic compounds (since they hydrogenate to cyclohexane).\n*   They must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water).\n*   They must not have conjugated double bonds.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms must be 18.\n*   The pair that fits these criteria is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Total hydrogens = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆ rings.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated, and cyclohexene has only one double bond.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a known type of catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in the products of the disproportionation reaction, which is 12 + 6 = 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first crucial step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Composition**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   **Formula Derivation**: Let the formula be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Saturation**: The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Identity**: Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits all the given information. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Properties**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Composition**: Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n*   **Reaction to Form Y**: Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction. In catalysis involving cyclic hydrocarbons, this typically involves a hydrogen transfer to produce the fully saturated cycloalkane and the fully unsaturated aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion**: The other component of Y must be benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene is aromatic, does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane. Therefore, **mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer\n*   **The Reaction**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y in a 1:1 molar ratio.

We can balance the hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Calculation**: The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of each component of mixture Y) is:\n    `12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18`\n*   **Final Answer**: Since the atoms are conserved, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of each component of mixture X) must also be 18. The question asks for exactly this value.\n\n### Step 4: Verification of Mixture X Components\nTo ensure the logic is sound, we can identify the components of mixture X.\n*   They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds that decolorize bromine water.\n*   They must not have conjugated double bonds.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms must be 18.\n*   The only pair that fits these criteria is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆ rings.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated (unlike its 1,3-isomer).\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n\nThe reasoning consistently leads to the conclusion that the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.

A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The clue that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\" strongly points to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), which is the most common cycloalkane solvent. This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z.

They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds (to decolorize bromine water and hydrogenate to cyclohexane) and must not have conjugated bonds. The pair that fits is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.

This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n*   **Formula Derivation:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(y * atomic mass of H) / (x * atomic mass of C + y * atomic mass of H)`. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), this becomes `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which indicates it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Identity:** Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and stable cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.

The problem also states that hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only Z. This implies that the other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton and must be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   **Reaction Clue:** Y is formed from X via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. In the context of cyclic hydrocarbons, this is a classic hydrogen transfer reaction, which typically produces the fully saturated (hydrogen-rich) compound and the fully unsaturated (hydrogen-poor) aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** The other component of Y must be the aromatic equivalent of cyclohexane, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic (and thus unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions) and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Final Answer\nThe final step is to use the law of conservation of atoms to find the answer.\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y. The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Component A of X + Component B of X → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n### Careful Points and Verification\n*   The deduction that Z is cyclohexane is robust, based on its formula, saturation, and use as a solvent.\n*   The identification of Y as cyclohexane and benzene is strongly supported by the disproportionation reaction mechanism and the chemical properties described.\n*   The core of the solution lies in the principle of atom conservation, which is a fundamental law. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (mixture X) must equal the total in the products (mixture Y).\n*   We can verify this is a chemically sound scenario by identifying the components of X. They must be unsaturated C₆ rings without conjugated bonds, and their hydrogens must sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits perfectly (10 + 8 = 18).\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.

This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Carbon Skeleton**: The fact that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane) is a critical clue. It means that all the compounds in both mixtures have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**:\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   The other component must also have a C₆ ring skeleton and not decolorize bromine water. Upon hydrogenation, it must yield cyclohexane. The only compound that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and thus unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction and Find the Answer**:\n    *   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   The reaction is: `Mixture X (X₁ + X₂) → Mixture Y (C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆)`.\n    *   Since the starting mixture X and the resulting mixture Y are both equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all components.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation. We can balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n        *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Verification (Optional but Recommended)**:\n    *   The components of X must be unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆ cyclic compounds.\n    *   We need two such compounds whose hydrogen counts sum to 18.\n    *   The logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water. 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. This scenario fits all the problem's conditions.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Our calculation shows this to be 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** A mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28% is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The empirical formula is CH₂.\n*   The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The fact that it is a widely used solvent, and all reactions center around it, strongly suggests it is the most common and stable example, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification is consistent across all provided analyses.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** Since one component is cyclohexane, the other component must also not decolorize bromine water and must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The only common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and thus unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, but it hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   The formation of Y by disproportionation (a hydrogen transfer) also supports this, as a cycloalkane (fully hydrogenated) and an aromatic ring (fully dehydrogenated) are the logical products.\n*   Therefore, **Mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This conclusion is also unanimous among the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Properties of Mixture X\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** Let the two components of mixture X be A and B. The reaction is:\n    `A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Analysis (Conservation of Atoms):** The total number of atoms must be conserved. Since hydrogenation of X yields only cyclohexane, both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton. Let their formulas be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ. To balance the hydrogen atoms in the reaction:\n    `a + b = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene)`\n    `a + b = 18`\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is precisely the sum `a + b`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two components of mixture X is 18. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of atoms in the established chemical reaction.\n\nThis conclusion can be further verified by identifying the components of X. They must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), non-conjugated C₆ cyclic compounds. The only pair that fits is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, confirming the result.\n\nAll provided analyses correctly follow this logical path and arrive at the number 18. The discrepancies in the final letter choices of some candidates appear to be clerical errors. The correct numerical answer is 18.\n\nBased on the options provided:\nA) 18\nB) 16\nC) 12\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by systematically deducing the identity of each substance and mixture based on the chemical properties described.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z**: I will use the given mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) to determine the empirical formula of Z. Combined with the information that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon and a common solvent, I can deduce its exact molecular formula and structure.\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y**: Knowing that Z is a component of Y, and that Y does not decolorize bromine water but hydrogenates completely to Z, I can identify the second component of Y. The disproportionation reaction type strongly suggests the second component is the aromatic counterpart to Z.\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer**: The reaction where mixture X forms mixture Y is a disproportionation, which is a hydrogen transfer in this case. By applying the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules from mixture X must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules of mixture Y. This calculation will directly answer the question.\n4.  **Code Implementation**: The Python code will perform the final calculation based on the deduced components of mixture Y, thereby finding the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry problem by deducing the components\n    and using the law of conservation of atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Deduce the components of Mixture Y.\n    # From the problem description:\n    # - Substance Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% (approx. 1/7),\n    #   is saturated, and is a common solvent.

It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** A mass fraction of 14.28% is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since Z is saturated, it cannot be an alkene. Therefore, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The fact that it's a widely used solvent strongly suggests it is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, the most common cycloalkane solvent. This fits all the criteria.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Carbon Skeleton**\n*   **Information:** Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a critical point. It means that every compound in both mixtures must have a six-carbon ring as its fundamental structure.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). It is formed by a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, its components must be saturated or aromatic. We know one component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ ring skeleton and not react with bromine water. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Let's check the hydrogenation: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. So, hydrogenating the mixture {cyclohexane, benzene} gives only cyclohexane. This fits perfectly.\n*   The formation via disproportionation (a hydrogen transfer) also makes sense: a more hydrogenated species (cyclohexane) and a less hydrogenated species (benzene) are formed.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y consists of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X and Solve the Problem**\n*   **Information:** X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that reacts to form Y. X decolorizes bromine water (so its components are unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction is: `Mixture X → Mixture Y`. Since both are equimolar mixtures, we can write the reaction for one molecule of each component:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms on the left side must equal the total on the right side.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of X₁ and one of X₂) must also be **18**.\n*   **Verification:** We can identify plausible structures for X₁ and X₂. They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds. The best candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and have a C₆ ring.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is not conjugated (unlike its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This confirms our calculation.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer, which is a known type of disproportionation over a platinum catalyst.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. As determined by the conservation of atoms in the reaction `X → Y`, this is the sum of hydrogen atoms in the products, cyclohexane (12 H) and benzene (6 H).\nTotal H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 22\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 12\n\nThe correct answer is 18, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n*   Let the molecular formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen can be approximated using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) as `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 1/7: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` which gives `7y = 12x + y`, simplifying to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states Z is \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and stable cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits all the given information. So, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Determine the Carbon Skeleton of All Components**\n\n*   A crucial piece of information is that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n*   This implies that all the chemical compounds in both mixtures have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring.\n\n**3. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. This type of reaction typically converts an unsaturated cyclic compound into a mixture of a fully saturated cycloalkane and a fully dehydrogenated aromatic compound.\n*   Given that one product is cyclohexane (the saturated C₆ ring), the other product must be benzene (C₆H₆), the aromatic C₆ ring.\n*   Let's check if this fits: Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n    *   It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Neither cyclohexane (saturated) nor benzene (aromatic) decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Hydrogenation of this mixture would convert benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only cyclohexane as the final product.\n*   This fits all conditions perfectly.

Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. This type of reaction typically converts an unsaturated cyclic compound into a mixture of a fully saturated cycloalkane and a fully unsaturated aromatic compound.\n*   Therefore, the other component of Y is likely the aromatic equivalent of cyclohexane, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   Let's check if this fits:\n    *   Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n    *   Neither component decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Hydrogenation of this mixture would convert benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only cyclohexane (Z) as the final product. This matches the problem description.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Identify Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that, upon heating with platinum, disproportionates to form mixture Y.\n*   The overall reaction is: `Component of X₁ + Component of X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`.\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**4. Verify the Properties of Mixture X**\n*   The components of X decolorize bromine water (they are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane, so both components must have a C₆ ring skeleton.\n*   We need two C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The sum of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds and is not conjugated (ruling out the 1,3-isomer).\n    *   This pair of compounds perfectly fits all the conditions described for mixture X.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the atom balance from the disproportionation reaction, this sum is 18. This is confirmed by identifying the likely components of mixture X as cyclohexene (10 hydrogens) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8 hydrogens), which sum to 18.\n\nThe correct option is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.

Identification of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   The hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z.

Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum in a disproportionation reaction. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall reaction is: `Mixture X (X₁ + X₂) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`.\n*   Since the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written as: `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`.\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n**4. Verification of the Components of Mixture X**\n*   To ensure this is a valid chemical scenario, we can identify the components of X.\n*   They must be C₆ cyclic compounds (since they hydrogenate to cyclohexane).\n*   They must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water).\n*   They must not have conjugated double bonds.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms must be 18.\n*   The pair that fits these criteria is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Total hydrogens = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆ rings.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated, and cyclohexene has only one double bond.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a known type of catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in the products of the disproportionation reaction, which is 12 + 6 = 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first crucial step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Composition**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   **Formula Derivation**: Let the formula be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Saturation**: The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Identity**: Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits all the given information. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Properties**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Composition**: Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n*   **Reaction to Form Y**: Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction. In catalysis involving cyclic hydrocarbons, this typically involves a hydrogen transfer to produce the fully saturated cycloalkane and the fully unsaturated aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion**: The other component of Y must be benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene is aromatic, does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane. Therefore, **mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer\n*   **The Reaction**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction is:\n    `Component 1 of X + Component 2 of X → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms**: According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We can balance the hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Calculation**: The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of each component of mixture Y) is:\n    `12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18`\n*   **Final Answer**: Since the atoms are conserved, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of each component of mixture X) must also be 18. The question asks for exactly this value.\n\n### Step 4: Verification of Mixture X Components\nTo ensure the logic is sound, we can identify the components of mixture X.\n*   They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds that decolorize bromine water.\n*   They must not have conjugated double bonds.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms must be 18.\n*   The only pair that fits these criteria is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆ rings.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated (unlike its 1,3-isomer).\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n\nThe reasoning consistently leads to the conclusion that the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.

A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The fact that Z is a widely used solvent and the central product of all reactions strongly suggests it is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, the most common cycloalkane solvent.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.

This type of reaction typically converts an unsaturated cyclic compound into a mixture of a fully saturated cycloalkane and a fully dehydrogenated aromatic compound.\n    *   Therefore, the other component of Y must be the aromatic equivalent of cyclohexane, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   Let's check the properties of mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}:\n        *   It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. (Correct)\n        *   It does not decolorize bromine water (cyclohexane is saturated, benzene is aromatic and unreactive with Br₂ water). (Correct)\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene (under severe conditions) gives cyclohexane.

A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states Z is a widely used solvent and the sole product of hydrogenation of all other components. This strongly suggests Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, a very common solvent and the most stable C₆ cycloalkane. This also implies all other compounds in the problem have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. Since cyclohexane is already saturated, the other component of Y must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n    *   The other component must not decolorize bromine water, which points to it being an aromatic compound.

This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n*   Let the formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The empirical formula of Z is CH₂, and the molecular formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The clue that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\" strongly points to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), which is the most common cycloalkane solvent. This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a typical alkene. The most logical candidate is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton. Benzene (C₆H₆) fits perfectly: it is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Identify Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation, which in this context is a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall reaction, given that both mixtures are equimolar, is:\n    `Component A + Component B (from Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules (one molecule of A and one of B) must also be 18.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". Based on the stoichiometric balance of the reaction, this sum is precisely 18.\n\nTo confirm this is chemically plausible, we can identify the components of X. They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds (to decolorize bromine water and hydrogenate to cyclohexane) and must not have conjugated bonds. The pair that fits is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, confirming our result from the reaction balance.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
