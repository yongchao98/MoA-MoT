    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State (`t < 0`):**\n    *   A magnetic field `B` is in the +Z direction.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with this field. The potential energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `U = -μ · B`. To be aligned, the moment must be in the lowest energy state.\n    *   The magnetic moment operator is `μ_vec = γ * S_vec`, where `S_vec` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = - (γ * S_z) * B`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `E_up`, corresponding to the spin-up state `|+z>`. So, the initial state of the particle is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`. (Note: even if we assume `γ < 0`, the resulting oscillation frequency remains the same, as shown in the detailed calculation below).\n\n2.  **Sudden Change (`t = 0`):**\n    *   The magnetic field in the Z direction is switched off.\n    *   A new magnetic field of the same magnitude `B` is switched on in the +Y direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (`t > 0`):**\n    *   The system now evolves under a new Hamiltonian, `H_new`.\n    *   `H_new = -μ · B_new = - (γ * S_vec) · (B * ŷ) = -γB * S_y`.\n    *   The time evolution of the state vector `|ψ(t)>` is governed by the Schrödinger equation, whose solution is `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting `H_new`, we get: `U(t) = exp(-i * (-γB * S_y) * t / ħ) = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ)`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expectation Value `<μz>(t)`:**\n    *   We want to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equivalent to finding `<S_z>(t)` and multiplying by `γ`. So, we need to calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   This is a classic problem of Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `<S_vec>` will precess around the direction of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis) with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\n5.  **Larmor Frequency:**\n    *   The Larmor frequency is given by the formula `ω_L = |γB|`.\n    *   As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis (and also the X-axis) will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency of `<S_z>(t)`, and consequently `<μ_z>(t)`, is `ω = |γB|`. Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive constants as is typical in such problems, the frequency is `γB`.\n\n6.  **Formal Quantum Mechanical Calculation (Optional but confirms the result):**\n    We can solve this formally using the matrix representation of spin operators (Pauli matrices).\n    *   `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    *   `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    *   Initial state `|+z>` is the vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n    *   The time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ) = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_n) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_n`, with `θ = γBt/2`:\n        `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|+z> = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now we compute `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   Finally, the average z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This expression clearly shows an oscillation described by `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both the conceptual understanding of Larmor precession and the detailed quantum mechanical calculation give the same result. The oscillation frequency is `γB`. This corresponds to the Larmor frequency. Comparing this with the given options:\n\n    A) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n    B) gamma*B/2\n    C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n    D) gamma*B\n\n    The correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
