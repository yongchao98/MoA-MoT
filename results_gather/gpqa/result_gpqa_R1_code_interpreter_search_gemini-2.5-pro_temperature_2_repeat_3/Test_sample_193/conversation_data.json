    "The user wants to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), where each spin can be +1 or -1.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the formula:\nE = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as the sum over all possible states (configurations) of the system:\nZ = Σ_states * e^(-βE)\nwhere β = 1/(kT), k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nThere are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations for the three spins. Let's list them, calculate the energy for each state, and then sum their Boltzmann factors (e^(-βE)).\n\nThe possible spin configurations (S1, S2, S3) are:\n1.  All spins are up: (+1, +1, +1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    Number of such states (degeneracy) = 1.\n\n2.  Two spins are up, one spin is down:\n    -   (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    -   (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    -   (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    There are 3 states with energy E = J.\n\n3.  One spin is up, two spins are down:\n    -   (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    -   (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    -   (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    There are 3 states with energy E = J.\n\n4.  All spins are down: (-1, -1, -1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    Number of such states (degeneracy) = 1.\n\nNow, let's group the states by their energy levels:\n-   **Energy level E1 = -3J**:\n    This energy level includes the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The degeneracy (number of states) is g1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n    The contribution to the partition function from this energy level is 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2 * e^(3Jβ).\n\n-   **Energy level E2 = J**:\n    This energy level includes all states with two spins of one type and one spin of the other.\n    The degeneracy is g2 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n    The contribution to the partition function from this energy level is 6 * e^(-β(J)) = 6 * e^(-Jβ).\n\nThe total partition function Z is the sum of the contributions from all energy levels:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nC) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
