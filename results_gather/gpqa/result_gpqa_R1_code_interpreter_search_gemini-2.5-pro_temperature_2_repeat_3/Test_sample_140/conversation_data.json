    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (a good leaving group) and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, NH₂⁻, is the active species).\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and removes an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   The C6 position, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   The C2 position, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, the abstraction of a proton (H⁺) is significantly faster than the abstraction of a deuteron (D⁺). However, both reactions are possible. This leads to two competing elimination pathways.\n\n3.  **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen (Major Pathway)**\n    *   The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The carbanion intermediate is unstable and immediately loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    *   This elimination results in the formation of a benzyne intermediate where a new triple bond is formed between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium (Minor Pathway)**\n    *   Less frequently, the amide ion can remove the deuteron from C2.\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C2.\n    *   This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    *   The resulting benzyne intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium atom was removed in this process, the resulting intermediate is a **non-deuterated benzyne**. The removed deuterium ends up forming deuterated ammonia (NH₂D).\n\n     \n\n5.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates.\n    *   The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n6.  **Products from Pathway A (from 3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** NH₂⁻ adds to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ gives a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** NH₂⁻ adds to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH₃ gives a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. Numbering the ring starting from the -NH₂ group, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Thus, Pathway A produces two distinct isomers: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n     \n\n7.  **Products from Pathway B (from non-deuterated benzyne)**\n    *   The intermediate is a symmetrical, non-deuterated benzyne.\n    *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2, but since the intermediate is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same initial carbanion (o-aminophenyl anion).\n    *   This carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n    *   The final product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n    *   (Note: The aminophenyl anion could also be deuterated by the NH₂D formed in this pathway, which would lead to 2-deuterioaniline. However, this is a product already accounted for in Pathway A. The new, unique product from this pathway is aniline.)\n\n     \n\n8.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The reaction produces a mixture of three structurally distinct organic products:\n        1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    *   Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *possible* products, which means we must consider all chemically viable pathways, even those that are slower.\n\nThe correct answer is 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
