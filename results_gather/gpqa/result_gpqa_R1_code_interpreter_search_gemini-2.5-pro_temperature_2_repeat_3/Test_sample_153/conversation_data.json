    "*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 amu (using the most abundant isotopes).\n    *   The peak at m/z = 158 is the M+2 peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which simplifies to approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75.8% for ³⁵Cl and 24.2% for ³⁷Cl.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the proposed structures. The molecular formula for all options (A, B, C, D) is C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass is (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. All options are consistent with the MS data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group. This rules out Phenyl chloroformate (C), which lacks an O-H group, and makes 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D) less likely, as a phenolic O-H is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H)** is in the typical chemical shift range for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its high chemical shift (downfield) is due to deshielding, and it appears as a singlet because acidic protons often do not couple with neighboring protons due to rapid chemical exchange. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid and rules out options C and D. We are now left with A (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and B (2-chlorobenzoic acid).\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)**. This pattern is crucial for determining the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two distinct doublets.\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is para-substituted. This structure would exhibit this exact NMR pattern.\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is ortho-substituted. This would result in four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Combining all the evidence, the compound must be 4-chlorobenzoic acid. It has the correct molecular weight and chlorine isotope pattern (MS), the characteristic functional groups of a carboxylic acid (IR), and the specific NMR pattern of a para-substituted aromatic ring attached to a carboxylic acid (¹H NMR).\n\n<<<A>>>"
