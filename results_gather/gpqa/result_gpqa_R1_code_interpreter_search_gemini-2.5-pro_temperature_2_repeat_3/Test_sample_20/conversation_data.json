    "**Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\nTautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a ketone (or aldehyde) form and an enol form (an alcohol adjacent to a double bond). A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound is a cyclic tri-ketone. The structure consists of a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. Each methylene group is located between two carbonyl groups, making the hydrogens on these carbons (alpha-hydrogens) particularly acidic. These alpha-hydrogens can easily be removed, allowing the compound to tautomerize into its highly stable enol form, which is phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), an aromatic compound. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exhibits tautomerism.\n\n*Conclusion for Part A:* The compound that **does not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon atom (carbon-2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Group 1: A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   Group 2: A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   Group 3: A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   Group 4: A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. Chiral molecules exhibit optical isomerism (existing as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center) halfway along the C=C bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry is achiral and thus cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*Conclusion for Part B:* The compound that **will show** optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching these findings with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
