    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at C-5, with the (S) configuration. This chiral center is not involved in the reaction and its configuration will be retained.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C-3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product:** 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the carbonyl carbon from two different faces.\n    *   This results in the formation of two possible configurations at C-3: (R) and (S).\n    *   Since the original chiral center at C-5 remains (S), the two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have two chiral centers, with one center being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs 3S). Diastereomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This is an **achiral** molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), 2. Acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Product:** Pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C-2 and C-4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers** of each other. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, these must be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has a plane of symmetry passing through the CH₂ group, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (they are superimposable).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture for HPLC Separation**\n\nThe combined final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   It can separate structural isomers and diastereomers.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute), giving a single peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) products are enantiomers. They will co-elute and produce **1 peak**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, giving its own **1 peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products from Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), so they will not co-elute with each other.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I products) + (Peaks from Rxn II products) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.\n*   This chiral environment allows for the separation of stereoisomers that interact differently with the stationary phase.\n*   It can separate **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   Therefore, each distinct stereoisomer in the mixture should produce a separate peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2 (diastereomer, separates)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4 (enantiomer, separates on chiral column)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5 (diastereomer, separates)\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
