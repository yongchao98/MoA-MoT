    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a VLT unit telescope, we need to follow two main steps for each star:\n1.  **Check for observability**: The star must be visible from the Paranal Observatory in Chile (Latitude ≈ -24.6° S).\n2.  **Check for brightness**: The star must be bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### Step 1: Find the Limiting Magnitude\n\nThe performance of ESPRESSO can be estimated using a formula often provided in its user manual. For the 1-UT (one Unit Telescope) mode, the S/N per binned pixel is approximately:\nS/N ≈ 24 * √(T_exp_minutes) * 10^(-0.2 * (V - 9))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_exp_minutes` is the exposure time in minutes.\n*   `V` is the apparent magnitude of the star.\n\nWe are given a target S/N of 10 and an exposure time of 1 hour (60 minutes). We can solve for the limiting magnitude `V_limit`.\n\n10 = 24 * √60 * 10^(-0.2 * (V_limit - 9))\n\nTo solve for V_limit, we will use a small python script. This script will also calculate the apparent magnitudes for the other stars in the list.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe will now check each star against the observability criteria and the calculated limiting magnitude.\n\n*   **Observability from Paranal (Latitude ~ -24.6° S):**\n    *   A star's declination (DEC) determines if it is visible. Polaris (the North Star) has a DEC of ~+89°. It is circumpolar in the Northern Hemisphere and is never visible from Paranal. Therefore, **Polaris is not detectable**.\n    *   Canopus has a DEC of ~-52°. It is a prominent star in the southern sky and is easily observable from Paranal.\n    *   The other stars are at DEC = 0° (the celestial equator), which are also easily observable from Paranal.\n\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n    For stars where the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) are given, the apparent magnitude (m) is calculated using the distance modulus formula:\n    m = M + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5\n    where d is in parsecs (pc).\n\nWe will now use a Python script to compute the limiting magnitude and the apparent magnitudes for stars c, d, e, and f, and then determine which stars are detectable.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the limiting V magnitude for S/N = 10 in T_exp = 60 minutes\n# Formula: S/N = 24 * sqrt(T_exp_minutes) * 10**(-0.2 * (V - 9))\n# 10 = 24 * sqrt(60) * 10**(-0.2 * (V_limit - 9))\nV_limit = 9 + (math.log10(10 / (24 * math.sqrt(60))) / -0.2)\n\n# Step 2: Evaluate each star\nstars = {\n    \"a) Canopus\": {'M': None, 'd': None, 'V': -0.74, 'DEC': -52},\n    \"b) Polaris\": {'M': None, 'd': None, 'V': 1.98, 'DEC': 89},\n    \"c) Star (d=10pc)\": {'M': 15, 'd': 10, 'V': None, 'DEC': 0},\n    \"d) Star (d=200pc)\": {'M': 15, 'd': 200, 'V': None, 'DEC': 0},\n    \"e) Star (d=5pc)\": {'M': 15, 'd': 5, 'V': None, 'DEC': 0},\n    \"f) Star (d=50pc)\": {'M': 15, 'd': 50, 'V': None, 'DEC': 0},\n}\n\nparanal_lat = -24.6\n# A star is generally not observable if its DEC is north of (90 - |latitude|)\nnorthern_dec_limit = 90 - abs(paranal_lat)\n\ndetectable_count = 0\nprint(f\"ESPRESSO Limiting Magnitude (S/N=10, 1hr): V <= {V_limit:.2f}\\n\")\nprint(\"Analysis:\")\n\nfor name, data in stars.items():\n    # Check Observability\n    if data['DEC'] > northern_dec_limit:\n        print(f\"- {name}: Not observable from Paranal (DEC = {data['DEC']}°).\")\n        continue\n\n    # Calculate Apparent Magnitude if not given\n    if data['V'] is None:\n        data['V'] = data['M'] + 5 * math.log10(data['d']) - 5\n\n    # Check Detectability\n    if data['V'] <= V_limit:\n        detectable = \"Detectable\"\n        detectable_count += 1\n    else:\n        detectable = \"Not detectable\"\n    \n    print(f\"- {name}: Observable.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine for each star if it is both observable from the Paranal Observatory and bright enough to meet the specified detection criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Observability from Paranal\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6° South.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** A star's declination determines its path across the sky.\n    *   **Polaris (b):** Has a declination of about +89°. It is the North Star and is only visible from the Northern Hemisphere. It will never rise above the horizon at Paranal. Therefore, **Polaris is not observable**.\n    *   **Canopus (a):** Has a declination of about -52°. As a prominent southern star, it is easily observable from Paranal.\n    *   **Stars c, d, e, f:** All have a declination of 0° (on the celestial equator). They are observable from almost anywhere on Earth, including Paranal.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Limiting Apparent Magnitude (V)\n\nThe problem states that a star is detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 is achieved in a 1-hour (60-minute) exposure. Using the provided ESPRESSO performance formula from the user manual overview (`S/N ≈ 24 * √(T_exp_minutes) * 10^(-0.2 * (V - 9))`):\n\n1.  **Set the known values:**\n    *   S/N = 10\n    *   T_exp_minutes = 60 min\n\n2.  **Solve for the limiting magnitude, V_limit:**\n    10 = 24 * √60 * 10^(-0.2 * (V_limit - 9))\n    10 / (24 * √60) = 10^(-0.2 * (V_limit - 9))\n    log₁₀(10 / (24 * √60)) = -0.2 * (V_limit - 9)\n    V_limit = 9 + [log₁₀(10 / (24 * √60)) / -0.2]\n    V_limit ≈ 9 + (-1.266 / -0.2)\n    V_limit ≈ 9 + 6.33\n    V_limit ≈ 15.33\n\nA star is detectable if its apparent magnitude `V` is **less than or equal to 15.33**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Star's Brightness\n\nNow we check each observable star's apparent magnitude against the V_limit of 15.33.\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** The apparent V magnitude of Canopus is **-0.74**.\n    *   -0.74 ≤ 15.33. **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n*   **b) Polaris:** Already excluded as it is not observable.\n\n*   **c), d), e), f):** For these stars, we first need to calculate their apparent magnitude (m or V) from their absolute magnitude (M = 15) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5`\n\n    *   **c) d = 10 pc:**\n        V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5 = **15.00**\n        *   15.00 ≤ 15.33. **Star (c) is detectable.**\n\n    *   **d) d = 200 pc:**\n        V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 2.30 - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = **21.50**\n        *   21.50 > 15.33. Star (d) is not detectable.\n\n    *   **e) d = 5 pc:**\n        V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.70 - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = **13.50**\n        *   13.50 ≤ 15.33. **Star (e) is detectable.**\n\n    *   **f) d = 50 pc:**\n        V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.70 - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = **18.50**\n        *   18.50 > 15.33. Star (f) is not detectable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe stars that would be detectable by ESPRESSO under the given conditions are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star (c) at 10 pc\n3.  Star (e) at 5 pc\n\nThis gives a total of **3** detectable stars.\n\n<<<C>>>"
