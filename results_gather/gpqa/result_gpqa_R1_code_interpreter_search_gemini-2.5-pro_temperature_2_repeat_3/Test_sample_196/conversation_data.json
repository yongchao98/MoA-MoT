    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (Compound X) from the provided spectral data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a very characteristic broad absorption for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption corresponding to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n        *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions indicate C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, which is a broad singlet far downfield, is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded. The two protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl Substituent Analysis (let's piece together the remaining signals):**\n            *   We have the following fragments based on chemical shift, integration, and splitting:\n                *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives a -CH₂-CH₃ (ethyl) fragment terminus.\n                *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-). This gives a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n                *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons. Based on the ethyl terminus identified above (0.9 ppm), this must be the -CH₂- group next to the terminal -CH₃.\n                *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This signal is relatively downfield for an alkyl proton, suggesting it is a benzylic proton (directly attached to the aromatic ring). This proton must be the -CH- from the -CH(CH₃)- fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to the adjacent -CH₃ (1.4 ppm) and the -CH₂- (1.7 ppm) groups.\n            *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The benzylic carbon (-CH- at 2.9 ppm) is attached to a methyl group (-CH₃ at 1.4 ppm) and an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃ at 1.7 and 0.9 ppm). The complete structure of the alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X has a *sec*-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) configuration. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D).\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃). It also reduces aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols to the corresponding alkanes.\n    *   **Applying the reaction to Compound X:** The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The Red P/HI will reduce the carboxylic acid group at position 1 to a methyl group. The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring will remain unchanged.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene (Incorrect structure)\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (Correct product)\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid (Incorrect structure)\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material, Compound X, not the final product)\n\nThe final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
