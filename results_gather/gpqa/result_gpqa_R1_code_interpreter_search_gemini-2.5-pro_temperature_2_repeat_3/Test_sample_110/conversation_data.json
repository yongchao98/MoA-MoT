    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n**2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK → A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a **Michael Addition** reaction. We have a ketone (which can form an enolate, the Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate, the Michael acceptor), and a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate ion.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen atom, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C5. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since only the C6 carbon has a proton, the base can only deprotonate at this position. This forms a single regiochemical enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate (specifically, the C6 carbon) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Product Structure (A):**\n    *   After the attack, an intermediate enolate is formed, which is then protonated (likely by t-butanol, the conjugate acid of the base, or during workup) to yield the final neutral product.\n    *   The original ketone: C1 is the carbonyl, C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and C6 has a methyl group.\n    *   The added group at C6 is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring where C1 is the carbonyl, C2 has ethyl and methyl groups, and C6 has a methyl group AND a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group.\n    *   Now, let's match this structure with the IUPAC names provided in the options. The options name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate. This requires re-numbering the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent.\n        *   Parent name: `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`\n        *   The cyclohexyl ring is attached to the propanoate chain at the carbon that was C6 in the original ketone. In the substituent naming convention, this attachment point is designated C1 of the ring.\n        *   Let's re-number the ring based on this new C1:\n            *   **New C1:** Point of attachment (was original C6). It also has a methyl group.\n            *   **New C2:** The carbonyl carbon (was original C1). Thus, we have a \"2-oxo\" substituent.\n            *   **New C3:** Has an ethyl group and a methyl group (was original C2).\n        *   Combining these pieces gives the substituent name: **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options A and B. Options C and D, which suggest a different connectivity (\"4-oxo\"), are incorrect.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n**1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH, H₂O → B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a **Michael Addition**. We have a nitroalkane (Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (Michael acceptor), and a base (KOH).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate):**\n    *   The base, KOH, abstracts a proton from the carbon α to the nitro group. These protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 10) due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the -NO₂ group and resonance stabilization of the resulting anion (the nitronate).\n    *   For 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂**CH₂**NO₂), the α-carbon has two acidic protons. Deprotonation forms the nucleophile: `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   Nucleophile (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`) attacks `CH₃-`**`CH`**`=CH-CN` at the β-carbon.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated by water to give the final product B.\n    *   Let's assemble the structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)` from 1-nitropropane is now bonded to `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` from but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The final structure is: **CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN**\n    *   To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n        *   The chain is 6 carbons long: N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃.\n        *   The parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   The IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and C. The name in options B and D (\"2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\") is incorrect; it has the wrong carbon count (6 carbons instead of 7) and structure.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results points to option A as the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
