    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the potential energy of the system.\n\n### **1. Problem Setup and Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). A grounded sphere has an electric potential of zero (V=0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` induces charges on the surface of the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is the superposition of the field from the point charge `q` and the field from the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nThe \"method of images\" provides a powerful way to solve this problem. We can replace the sphere and its induced charges with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The electric field outside the original sphere's volume will be identical to the field produced by the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\nFor a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` must be placed such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude (q'):** The image charge is located on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. Its magnitude is:\n    `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\n*   **Image charge position (b):** The distance of the image charge from the center of the sphere is:\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\n### **2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position `d`, while the sphere remains grounded.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to calculate this energy.\n\n**Method 1: Integration of Force**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the negative of the work `W_field` done by the electric field of the induced charge as `q` is brought from infinity.\n`U = -W_field = -∫(from ∞ to d) F_induced ⋅ dr`\n\nThe force on the charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. As the position of `q` changes (let's call its variable position `x`), the magnitude and position of its image also change (`q'(x) = -qR/x`, `b(x) = R²/x`).\n\nThe attractive force on charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F(x) = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\nThe potential energy `U` is:\n`U = -W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n`U = k * q² * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n`∫ [x / (x² - R²)²] dx = ∫ [1/u²] (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x² - R²))`\n\nNow, evaluating the definite integral:\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(x² - R²)) ](from ∞ to d)`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ (-1 / (2(d² - R²))) - (-1 / (2(∞² - R²))) ]`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(d² - R²)) - 0 ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Interaction Energy of the Image System**\n\nA well-known result from electrostatics states that the potential energy of a point charge `q` in the presence of a grounded conductor is equal to half the interaction energy between the charge `q` and its image `q'`.\n\n`U = (1/2) * U_interaction = (1/2) * (k * q * q' / r)`\n\nwhere `r` is the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n*   `r = d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n*   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nNow, substitute these into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * k * q * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\nThe `d` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out.\n`U = (1/2) * k * q * [-qR] / [d² - R²]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system:\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nThis expression is negative, which is expected because the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere (as the induced charge is of the opposite sign overall).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) `U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   B) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   C) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   D) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)`\n\nOur derived formula `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)` exactly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
