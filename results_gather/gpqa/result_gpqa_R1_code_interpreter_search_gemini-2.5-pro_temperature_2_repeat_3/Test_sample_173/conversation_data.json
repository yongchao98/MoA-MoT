    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the initial and final states.**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`. They are moving, so they have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n**2. Determine the rest masses of the fragments.**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `m1 = 2 * m2` (one fragment is twice as massive as the other). We'll designate `m1` as the more massive fragment.\n*   The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nLet's work with rest-mass energies (in GeV), as it simplifies calculations:\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Sum of fragment rest-mass energies: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We also have the relation `m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2)`.\n\nNow, we can solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n*   Substitute `m1*c^2` into the sum: `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n*   `3 * (m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`.\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nSo, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`) is 198 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\nEnergy must be conserved. The initial energy (`M*c^2`) is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy (`Q`) is the mass-energy that was \"lost\" in the fission.\n\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Final Total Rest-Mass Energy)`\n*   `Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate `T1` using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial nucleus was at rest (momentum = 0), so the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta: `p1 = -p2`. Their magnitudes are equal: `|p1| = |p2| = p_classical`.\n*   From `p_classical^2 = 2*m*T`, we get `2*m1*T1_classical = 2*m2*T2_classical`.\n*   `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (99 GeV/c^2) / (198 GeV/c^2) = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`. The less massive fragment gets more kinetic energy.\n*   **Energy Conservation:** We know `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct `T1` using relativistic mechanics.**\n\nThe relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The total energy `E` is also the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy, `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Combining these gives `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, which simplifies to `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** As before, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal: `|p1| = |p2| = p_relativistic`. Therefore, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n*   **Energy Conservation:** We know `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`, so `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n\nNow, we solve for `T1`:\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV.\nM_E = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy\nm1_E = 198.0 # Rest-mass energy of massive fragment\nm2_E = 99.0  # Rest-mass energy of less massive fragment\n\n# Q-value (total kinetic energy)\nQ = M_E - (m1_E + m2_E)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation for T1 ---\n# From conservation of momentum (T1*m1 = T2*m2) and energy (T1+T2=Q)\n# T1c * m1 = (Q - T1c) * m2\n# T1c * (m1 + m2) = Q * m2\n# T1c = Q * m2 / (m1 + m2)\nT1_classical = Q * m2_E / (m1_E + m2_E)\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation for T1 ---\n# We can use a derived formula from the conservation of total energy and momentum.\n# The total energy of fragment 2 is E2 = (M_E^2 - m1_E^2 + m2_E^2) / (2 * M_E)\nE2_total = (M_E**2 - m1_E**2 + m2_E**2) / (2 * M_E)\n# The kinetic energy T2 is E2 - m2_E\nT2_relativistic = E2_total - m2_E\n# The kinetic energy T1 is Q - T2\nT1_relativistic = Q - T2_relativistic\n\n# --- Difference ---\n# Calculate the difference in GeV and convert to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n```\n> Classical T1: 1.0000 GeV\n> Relativistic T1: 1.0050 GeV\n> Difference: 5.0 MeV\n\nThe value of `T1` calculated using classical approximation is `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\nThe correct (relativistic) value of `T1` is `T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the difference.**\n\n*   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert this to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Extract Key Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of rest-mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial total momentum is 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relation:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll label the more massive one `m₁`, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 M`.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) using both relativistic and classical physics, and find the difference. The difference should be expressed in MeV.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses (or Rest-Mass Energies)**\n\nIt's easiest to work with rest-mass energies (`mc²`).\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   Total final rest-mass energy: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We also have the mass relation in terms of energy: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n\nNow we can solve this system of two equations:\n1.  Substitute the relation into the sum: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n2.  `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n3.  `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n4.  `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, the rest-mass energies are:\n*   More massive fragment (`m₁`): **198 GeV**\n*   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): **99 GeV**\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nBy conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Final Rest-Mass Energy)`\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   The total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is **3 GeV**.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical Approximation (`T₁_classical`)**\n\nIn classical (non-relativistic) physics:\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial momentum was zero, so the fragments must fly off with equal and opposite momenta. Let their momentum magnitude be `p`.\n*   **Kinetic Energy:** The classical formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   We can write `p² = 2m₁T₁_classical` and `p² = 2m₂T₂_classical`.\n*   Therefore, `m₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical`.\n*   This gives us the ratio of kinetic energies: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 99 / 198 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Energy Conservation:** We know `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute `T₂_classical`: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas (`T₁_relativistic`)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics:\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** Same as before, the momentum magnitudes are equal. Let this magnitude be `p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc²`).\n*   From this, we can find `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)²`.\n*   Applying this to both fragments:\n    *   `(pc)² = (T₁ + m₁c²)² - (m₁c²)²`\n    *   `(pc)² = (T₂ + m₂c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n*   Equating the two expressions for `(pc)²`: `(T₁ + m₁c²)² - (m₁c²)² = (T₂ + m₂c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n*   **Energy Conservation:** We also know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n*   Substitute `T₂`, `m₁c²`, and `m₂c²` (all in GeV):\n    `(T₁ + 198)² - 198² = ( (3 - T₁) + 99)² - 99²`\n    `(T₁ + 198)² - 198² = (102 - T₁)² - 99²`\n*   Expand the squares:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ + 198² - 198² = (102² - 204T₁ + T₁²) - 99²`\n*   Cancel terms (`T₁²` and `198²`):\n    `396T₁ = 10404 - 204T₁ - 9801`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 10404 - 9801`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n*   `T₁_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
