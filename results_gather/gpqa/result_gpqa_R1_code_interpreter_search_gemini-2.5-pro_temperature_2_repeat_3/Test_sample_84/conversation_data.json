    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics Principle:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is determined by the energy it receives from the star and its own properties. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_*$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the distance from the star for a circular orbit).\n    *   $A$ is the planet's bond albedo (the fraction of power reflected).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Let's write it out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states several simplifying conditions:\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so $T_*$ and $R_*$ are the same and will cancel out.\n    *   The planets possess the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$, and the $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ term will also cancel out.\n    *   The constant '2' also cancels out.\n\n    After cancellation, the formula simplifies significantly:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2}$\n    So, the problem now boils down to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$.\n\n5.  **Connect to the Given Data:** The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is used to find the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K$.\n\n6.  **Relate RV Data to Semi-Major Axis:** The formula for the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    where:\n    *   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_*$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n    A crucial piece of information is that the planets were also detected via the *transit method*. A transit can only be observed if the planet's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$. Therefore, we can assume $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\n7.  **Isolate the Semi-Major Axis (a):** I need to rearrange the formula to solve for 'a' to find the ratio $a_2/a_1$.\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_*} \\sqrt{a}}$\n    $\\sqrt{a} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_*}}$\n    $a = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_*}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 G}{K_2^2 M_*}}{\\frac{M_{p1}^2 G}{K_1^2 M_*}}$\n\n    The terms $G$ and $M_*$ are the same for both planets and cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n9.  **Determine the Input Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$):**\n        $M_{p1} = 7 \\ M_{Earth}$\n        $M_{p2} = 5 \\ M_{Earth}$\n        $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio ($K_1/K_2$):** The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is the same as the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n        $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n        $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Result:** Now, I'll substitute these ratios back into the equations.\n    *   First, the semi-major axis ratio:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n    *   Second, the equilibrium temperature ratio:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    *   Finally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n        $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n11. **Compare with Options:**\n    A) ~ 1.30\n    B) ~ 0.98\n    C) ~ 0.53\n    D) ~ 1.05\n\n    The calculated value of ~0.536 is closest to option C.

Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$)**\nNow we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes by dividing the equation for Planet 2 by the equation for Planet 1:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{M_{p2}^2 G}{K_2^2 M_*} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{M_{p1}^2 G}{K_1^2 M_*} \\right)}$\n\nThe gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**7. Determine the Mass and RV Ratios from Given Data**\n*   **Mass Ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$):**\n    $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio ($K_1/K_2$):**\n    The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of the spectral line. Therefore, the ratio of K values is the same as the ratio of the given Doppler shifts.\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n**8. Calculate the Final Result**\nNow substitute these ratios back into the equations.\n\n*   First, calculate the ratio of semi-major axes:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n*   Second, calculate the temperature ratio using this result:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n*   Finally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.536 is closest to option C. The previous code execution confirms this result.\n\n<<<C>>>"

The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?\n\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
