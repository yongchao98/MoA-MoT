    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n1.  **Identify the governing equations:** The scalar potential V and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ for a time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time. The quantities inside the integral are evaluated at this earlier time $t_r$ to account for the finite speed of light.\n\n2.  **Define the source distributions:** For a single point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge at time $t'$.\n\n3.  **Substitute the source into the potential integrals:**\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the integrals:** These integrals are not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard result from electromagnetism theory for evaluating this integral is:\n    $\\int f(\\vec{r}') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r)) d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{f(\\vec{r}')}{1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot (\\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{\\vec{r}' = \\vec{s}(t_r)}$\n    where the notation implies that all terms inside the bracket are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$ which satisfies $d = c(t-t_r)$. In the problem's notation:\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at $t_r$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the scalar potential (V):**\n    Using the integration formula with $f(\\vec{r}') = q/|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'| = q/d$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q/d}{1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot (\\vec{v}/c)} \\right]$\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d(1 - (\\vec{d}/d) \\cdot (\\vec{v}/c))} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}$\n    To match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    Similarly, for the vector potential, the function to integrate is $f(\\vec{r}') = q\\vec{v}(t_r)/|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|$. The velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r)$ is evaluated at the retarded time and is constant with respect to the spatial integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. So we can pull it out of the effective integral evaluation:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\vec{v}(t_r) \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    We can see that the integral part is exactly what we evaluated for $V$, divided by the constants.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v}(t_r) V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n    Using the relationship $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n    Substituting the expression for V:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    Now, let's examine the expression for $\\vec{A}$ in the proposed options. Option C gives:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    Let's substitute $\\mu_0 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 c^2)$ into this expression to check if it matches our result:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{(1/(\\epsilon_0 c^2)) qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 c (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    This matches our derived expression.\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:**\n    The derived potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    These expressions match exactly with option C. The '-' sign in the denominator is crucial and accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect; the potential is enhanced when the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\n<<<C>>>"
