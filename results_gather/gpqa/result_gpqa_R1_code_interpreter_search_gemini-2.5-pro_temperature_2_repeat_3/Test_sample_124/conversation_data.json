    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and its Hamiltonian:**\n    The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$, where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three directions.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The energy eigenvalues of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be found by separating the Schrödinger equation in Cartesian coordinates. The total energy is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n    The energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n    So, the total energy is:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_n = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n$ can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...). The energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    We need to identify the energy level corresponding to the \"third excited state\".\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest possible energy state, which occurs when $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level, corresponding to $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The number of \"linearly independent eigenfunctions\" for a given energy eigenvalue is the degeneracy of that energy level. We need to find how many different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ add up to $n=3$.\n    We can enumerate the possibilities:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — **3 states**\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n        (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — **6 states**\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        (1, 1, 1) — **1 state**\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, one can use the general formula for the degeneracy of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\n5.  **Match with the Options:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n    B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n    C) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n    D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n\n    Option D correctly matches both the energy and the degeneracy. The energy expressions in options A and B are for a particle in a spherical box, not a harmonic oscillator.\n\n<<<D>>>"
