    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$.\n\n1.  **Understand the Components of the Hamiltonian:**\n    *   $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$\n    *   $\\varepsilon$ is a constant with the dimension of energy.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices.\n    *   $\\vec{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is an arbitrary unit vector, which means its magnitude is 1: $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Strategy: Find the Eigenvalues of $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ first.**\n    The Hamiltonian $H$ is the matrix $M = \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ scaled by a constant $\\varepsilon$. If the eigenvalues of $M$ are $\\lambda_M$, then the eigenvalues of $H = \\varepsilon M$ will be $\\lambda_H = \\varepsilon \\lambda_M$. So, our main task is to find the eigenvalues of the matrix $M$.\n\n3.  **Use a Key Property of Pauli Matrices.**\n    There is a very useful identity involving the dot product of the Pauli vector $\\vec{\\sigma}$ with two other vectors $\\vec{A}$ and $\\vec{B}$:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{A})(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{B}) = (\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B})I + i \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{A} \\times \\vec{B})$\n    where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Square of the Matrix M.**\n    Let's find $M^2 = (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})$. We can use the identity from step 3 by setting both $\\vec{A}$ and $\\vec{B}$ to be our unit vector $\\vec{n}$:\n    $M^2 = (\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n})I + i \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n})$\n\n5.  **Simplify using Vector Properties.**\n    *   The dot product of a unit vector with itself is its magnitude squared: $\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n} = |\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$.\n    *   The cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector: $\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n} = \\vec{0}$.\n    *   Substituting these into the equation for $M^2$:\n    $M^2 = (1)I + i \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{0}) = I + 0 = I$\n    So, the square of the matrix $M = \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ is the identity matrix.\n\n6.  **Relate the Eigenvalues of M to MÂ².**\n    Let $\\lambda_M$ be an eigenvalue of the matrix $M$ with a corresponding eigenvector $v$. By definition:\n    $Mv = \\lambda_M v$\n    If we apply the matrix $M$ again to both sides:\n    $M(Mv) = M(\\lambda_M v)$\n    $M^2 v = \\lambda_M (Mv)$\n    Substitute $Mv = \\lambda_M v$ into the right side:\n    $M^2 v = \\lambda_M (\\lambda_M v) = \\lambda_M^2 v$\n    We know from step 5 that $M^2 = I$, so $M^2 v = I v = v$.\n    Therefore, we have:\n    $v = \\lambda_M^2 v$\n    This implies that $\\lambda_M^2 = 1$.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Eigenvalues of M.**\n    The equation $\\lambda_M^2 = 1$ has two solutions:\n    $\\lambda_M = +1$ and $\\lambda_M = -1$.\n    So, the eigenvalues of the matrix $M = \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are +1 and -1.\n\n8.  **Determine the Eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H.**\n    Finally, we find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H = \\varepsilon M$. They are simply the eigenvalues of $M$ multiplied by the constant $\\varepsilon$:\n    $\\lambda_H = \\varepsilon \\lambda_M = \\varepsilon (\\pm 1) = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n    The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n9.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    A) + \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n    B) +1, -1\n    C) +\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2\n    D) +\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2\n\n    Our result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
