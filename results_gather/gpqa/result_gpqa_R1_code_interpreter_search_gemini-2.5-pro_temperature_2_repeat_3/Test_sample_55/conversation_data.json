    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The problem states this happens via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means it is a cascade decay involving an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nA single-step transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is forbidden by the electric dipole selection rules, as we will see below.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an electric dipole transition between an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number (l):** $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number (m):** $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number (n):** $\\Delta n$ can be any integer value ($\\Delta n = n' - n \\neq 0$). For a decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (so $n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $E_{n'} < E_3$. In the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, energy only depends on $n$: $E_n = -E_R/n^2$, where $E_R$ is the Rydberg energy. $E_{n'} < E_3$ means $-E_R/n'^2 < -E_R/3^2$, which simplifies to $1/n'^2 > 1/9$, or $n'^2 < 9$. This implies $n' < 3$. So possible values for $n'$ are 1 and 2.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ (so $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$).\n*   The intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ is the initial state for this transition. We found above that $l'=1$ and $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This is satisfied for $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $E_{n'} > E_1$. This means $-E_R/n'^2 > -E_R/1^2$, which implies $1/n'^2 < 1$, or $n' > 1$.\n\n**Combining the conditions for n':**\nFrom the first transition, we found $n' \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\nFrom the second transition, we found $n' > 1$.\nThe only integer value that satisfies both conditions is $n' = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the intermediate state must be of the form $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$, where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n### 4. Identifying the Possible Transition Routes\nBased on the allowed intermediate states, there are three possible cascade routes:\n*   **Route 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 2:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 3:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll the routes listed in options A, C, and D are valid possible pathways according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the \"corresponding probability\". In the context of multiple decay paths, this refers to the branching ratio of the first transition. The total decay probability for the atom in the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to decay to the level $n=2$ is split among the three possible $m'$ sublevels of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state.\n\nThe transition probability from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$.\nFor the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric.\n*   Due to the rotational invariance of the electromagnetic interaction and the spherical symmetry of the initial state, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ sublevels must be the same, regardless of the value of $m'$. This is a direct consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n*   Since there are three possible and equally likely final states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$), the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n\nSo, the branching ratio for each channel is:\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\nOnce the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state with probability 1 (as this is the only allowed E1 decay channel from the 2p state). Therefore, the probability associated with each entire cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\nLet's check the given options:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) is correct.\n\n*   **B) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   The initial state is missing (typographical error), but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\nOnly option A provides a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
