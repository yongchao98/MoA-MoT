    "This problem requires understanding the selectivity of two different reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of the subsequent reactions.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The product for both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone (a cyclic ester). The ring consists of one oxygen atom and five carbon atoms. The IUPAC name indicates the oxygen is at position 1, the carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2, and an ethyl group is at position 4. The chiral center is the carbon at position 4, which is bonded to the ethyl group.\n\n    ```\n        CH2(6)--CH2(5)\n       /          \\\n      O(1)        *CH(Et)(4)\n       \\          /\n        C(2)(=O)--CH2(3)\n    ```\n    *   This lactone is formed from a linear 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid through intramolecular esterification (lactonization).\n        `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-C*H(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\n    *   Note that the chiral carbon C3 in the open-chain acid becomes the chiral carbon C4 in the lactone. The reaction does not involve bond changes at this chiral center, so the stereochemistry (R/S configuration) is retained.\n\n*   **Starting Materials (Options):** The options propose stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has two different carboxyl-derived functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu). It is a mono-ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-C*H(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`\n    The chiral center is at C3.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4). LiBH4 is a reducing agent that is more selective than LiAlH4. It readily reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. It reduces esters faster than carboxylic acids. In the presence of a carboxylic acid, it first acts as a base, deprotonating the acid to form a carboxylate salt (`-COO⁻ Li⁺`), which is then resistant to reduction.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 is deprotonated.\n        `A (HOOC...-COOiBu)` ---`LiBH4`---> `Li⁺ ⁻OOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylate to give the carboxylic acid.\n        `⁻OOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` ---`H⁺`---> `HOOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid)\n    3.  Under acidic conditions, this hydroxy-acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5 of the carbon chain. The chiral center at C3 is not affected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3). Borane is a powerful reducing agent, particularly known for its rapid reduction of carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the ester group at C5 intact.\n        `B (HOOC...-COOiBu)` ---`BH3`---> `HOCH2-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-COOiBu` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) is used to process the intermediate borate esters and also catalyzes the intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5 of the carbon chain. The chiral center at C3 is not affected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the conclusions from both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches the pair of compounds listed in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
