    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached to it. The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This halogen atom is one of the two substituents.\n\nLet's assemble the structure:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The simplest and most common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This group contains a carbonyl (C=O) and two carbons.\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n**2. Analyze the Possible Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR Spectra:**\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in three possible positions on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n*   **Protons from the Acetyl Group:** The acetyl group (-COCH₃) has a methyl group. These 3 protons are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will always appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Protons from the Aromatic Ring:** The benzene ring has 4 protons.\n    *   **Ortho (1,2) and Meta (1,3) Isomers:** In these arrangements, the molecule has low symmetry. The 4 aromatic protons would be chemically non-equivalent and would split each other, resulting in a complex pattern of multiplets (e.g., doublets, triplets, doublet of doublets) in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm).\n    *   **Para (1,4) Isomer:** This isomer is highly symmetrical. There are only two types of aromatic protons due to a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents.\n        *   The 2 protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent.\n        *   The 2 protons ortho to the halogen group are equivalent.\n        *   Each set of protons splits the other, so the aromatic region will show two distinct **doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\nNow, let's compare the predicted spectra with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone.\n    *   The singlet at 3.7 ppm integrates to 2H, not 3H, which is inconsistent with an acetyl methyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern perfectly matches the expected signal for the 4 aromatic protons of a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The integration (2H+2H=4H) is correct.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm, which is exactly what we expect for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   This option perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic proton region (around 7-8 ppm). The chemical shifts and splitting patterns are inconsistent with a haloacetophenone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Similar to option C, this spectrum is missing the characteristic aromatic proton signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe structure that fits all the information provided is 4-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option B is the only one that corresponds to this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
