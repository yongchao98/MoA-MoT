    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Physical Model\n\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with a symmetry axis (z-axis). This oscillation creates electromagnetic radiation. In physics, radiation from a localized, oscillating charge/current distribution is described by a multipole expansion. The dominant contributions typically come from the lowest-order non-zero terms, which are:\n*   Electric Dipole (lowest order)\n*   Magnetic Dipole\n*   Electric Quadrupole\n\nUnless there is a specific symmetry that makes the electric dipole moment zero, electric dipole radiation is the strongest and most dominant form. The problem statement is general, so we should assume the most common and fundamental case, which is electric dipole radiation. The spheroid shape and z-axis symmetry naturally define an axis along which an electric dipole can oscillate.\n\n### 2. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power (Electric Dipole)\n\nFor an electric dipole `p` oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` in the radiation zone is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `C` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment amplitude, frequency, and fundamental constants.\n*   `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\nThis radiated power per unit solid angle is the function `f(λ, θ)` mentioned in the question.\n\nThe problem states that the *maximum* radiated power is `A`. We need to find where this maximum occurs. The `sin²(θ)` function has a maximum value of 1 when `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n\nSo, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\nThus, the constant `C` is equal to the maximum power `A`.\n\nThe formula can be rewritten as: `f(θ) = dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ)`.\n\nWe are asked to find the fraction of `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We calculate the power at this angle:\n\n`Power at 30° = A * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nTherefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nSo, the power radiated at 30° is `A * (1/4) = A/4`.\n\nThe *fraction* of the maximum power `A` is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\nThis result eliminates options B and C. We are left with options A and D.\n\n### 3. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nNow we need to determine the \"possible form of `f`,\" specifically its dependence on the wavelength `λ`. The full formula for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle from an oscillating electric dipole is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π²ε₀c³) * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n\nThe function `f` is `dP/dΩ`. We are interested in its dependence on wavelength `λ`. The angular frequency `ω` is related to wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by:\n\n`ω = 2π * (frequency) = 2π * (c/λ)`\n\nFrom this relation, we can see that `ω` is inversely proportional to `λ` (`ω ∝ 1/λ`).\n\nLooking at the power formula, `dP/dΩ` is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n\n`f ∝ dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nSubstituting the dependence on `λ`:\n\n`f ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, a possible form for `f` is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. This is a classic result; the power radiated by a dipole is very sensitive to frequency (and wavelength). This is the basis for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue (shorter wavelengths scatter much more strongly).\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\n*   The fraction of maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The radiated power per unit solid angle `f` has a dependence on wavelength of **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\nCombining these two findings, we get `1/4` and `λ⁻⁴`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n(As a check, if the source were an electric quadrupole, the power would be proportional to `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` and `ω⁶`. This would lead to a fraction of `3/4` and a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁶`, which is option B. However, the dipole model is the most natural interpretation of the problem statement.)\n\n<<<D>>>"
