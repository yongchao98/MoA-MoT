    "*   **Analysis of the Experiment:**\n    *   **Antigen Delivery:** Rotavirus proteins are delivered orally, mimicking a natural infection of the gut.\n    *   **Target Site:** The immune response is observed in Peyer's patches, which are crucial secondary lymphoid organs for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens. The fluorescence indicates the viral proteins have been taken up by cells in this location.\n    *   **Cellular Response:** Cells are proliferating, which is a sign of an active immune response, specifically the expansion of antigen-specific lymphocytes. In Peyer's patches, this typically occurs in structures called germinal centers.\n    *   **Genetic Observation:** The key finding is \"high variability\" in the sequenced \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells. This points to a process that introduces mutations into the part of the antibody gene that codes for the antigen-binding site.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid tissues (like Peyer's patches). It deliberately introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). The goal is to select for B cells that produce antibodies with higher affinity for the antigen. This process is the direct cause of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene during an ongoing immune response. This perfectly matches the experimental observations.\n    *   **B) V(D)J recombination:** This is the genetic rearrangement process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in developing B cells in the bone marrow, *before* they encounter any antigen. While it creates variability, it is not the process happening in *proliferating* cells in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure. The cells in the Peyer's patch have already undergone V(D)J recombination.\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. It changes the constant region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the antibody's function. However, CSR does *not* affect the variable region, so it would not cause the observed variability in the variable heavy chain gene.\n    *   **D) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system, a cascade of proteins that helps clear pathogens. It is not a genetic process that alters the genes of B cells.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in a Peyer's patch after antigen stimulation is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation, a key feature of the germinal center reaction and affinity maturation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
