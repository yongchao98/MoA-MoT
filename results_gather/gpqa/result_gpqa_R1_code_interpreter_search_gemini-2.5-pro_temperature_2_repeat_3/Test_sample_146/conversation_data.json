    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this particle annihilation process is the conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the annihilation must equal the total momentum after the annihilation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   The process starts with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In particle physics, \"slowly moving\" implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can therefore assume the initial system is effectively at rest.\n*   **Initial Momentum ($P_{initial}$):** Since the particles are essentially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n    $P_{initial} \\approx 0$\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** With negligible kinetic energy, the initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. A proton and an antiproton have the same mass.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Rest mass energy of an antiproton, $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are antiparticles of each other, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\n*   We are given the rest mass energy of particle A: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Final Momentum ($P_{final}$):** Due to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the four created particles must fly off in directions such that their vector momenta cancel out.\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles. By symmetry, each of the four final particles must have the same kinetic energy and thus the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nNow we set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n$1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n$1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n**5. Calculate the Velocity**\n\nFinally, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity ($v$) of the A particles.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is approximately $v = 0.77c$.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
