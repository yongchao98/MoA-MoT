    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad and centered slightly higher (around 3300 cm⁻¹). The presence of other peaks strongly supports the carboxylic acid assignment.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch of a carboxylic acid (usually 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl-hydrogens are the hydrogen atoms directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very strong indicator of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The mass of this fragment is calculated as:\n        *   Carbon (C): ~12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Hydrogen (H): ~1 amu\n        *   Total: 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This fragment, [COOH]⁺, is a classic and stable fragmentation product for carboxylic acids.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O at 1700) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z = 45 fragment) overwhelmingly points to the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This requires the molecule to have **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch at 1650) and 1H NMR (vinyl-hydrogens) confirms the presence of at least one **carbon-carbon double bond**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Proposed Formulas using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2). Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n    *   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond. So, we are looking for a formula with DoU ≥ 2.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   **A) C6H12O:** Has only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. Ruled out. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is also inconsistent.\n        *   **B) C6H10O:** Has only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. Ruled out. DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While the DoU matches, the oxygen count is wrong.\n        *   **C) C6H10O2:** Has two oxygens, consistent with a carboxylic acid. Let's check the DoU: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This option is a perfect match for all the evidence.\n        *   **D) C6H12O2:** Has two oxygens. Let's check the DoU: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 means there is only one pi bond or one ring. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid). This contradicts the evidence for a C=C double bond from FTIR and NMR. Ruled out.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The only formula that fits all the spectral data is C6H10O2. It has the required two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and a degree of unsaturation of 2, which accounts for both the C=C bond and the C=O bond.\n\n<<<C>>>"
