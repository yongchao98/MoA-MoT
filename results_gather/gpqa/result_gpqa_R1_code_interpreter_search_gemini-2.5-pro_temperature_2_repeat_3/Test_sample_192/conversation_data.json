    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance range (dN/dr) and the distance (r).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are given that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) according to the following relation:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n    This means the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to plx⁻⁵.\n\n3.  **Recall the Fundamental Relationship:** Parallax (plx) and distance (r) are inversely related. The standard definition is:\n    plx = 1/r\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Differentiation:** We need to find dN/dr, but we have an expression for dN/d(plx). We can connect these two derivatives using the chain rule from calculus:\n    dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative of Parallax with Respect to Distance:** We need to find the term d(plx)/dr.\n    Given plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n    The derivative is:\n    d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n6.  **Substitute the Known Quantities into the Chain Rule Equation:** Now, we replace the terms in the chain rule equation with the expressions we know.\n    -   From the problem statement: dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n    -   From our calculation in step 5: d(plx)/dr = -1/r²\n\n    Substituting these into the chain rule formula gives:\n    dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (-1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):** The final goal is a relationship involving only 'r'. We use the parallax-distance relation (plx = 1/r) to eliminate 'plx' from the equation.\n    Substitute plx = 1/r into the term 1/plx⁵:\n    1/plx⁵ = 1/((1/r)⁵) = 1/(1/r⁵) = r⁵\n\n8.  **Final Substitution and Simplification:** Now substitute this result back into our proportionality for dN/dr:\n    dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ -r⁵⁻²\n    dN/dr ∝ -r³\n\nThe negative sign indicates that for a positive d(plx), there is a negative dr, which is consistent with their inverse relationship. The question asks how the number of stars *changes with* distance, which refers to the magnitude of the distribution. Therefore, we are interested in the proportionality:\n\ndN/dr ∝ r³\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit range of distance scales as the cube of the distance.\n\n<<<C>>>"
