    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Relationship Between Absorbed and Emitted Light:**\n    When a molecule in a dye absorbs light, its electrons jump to a higher energy state. This is called excitation. When the electrons return to their ground state, they can release energy in the form of light, which is called emission (or fluorescence). Due to some energy loss through non-radiative processes (like vibrations), the emitted light is always of *lower energy* and *longer wavelength* than the absorbed light. This energy difference is known as the Stokes shift.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Wavelength of the Emitted Light:**\n    The question provides the energy of the *emitted* light, E = 2.3393 eV. We need to convert this energy into a wavelength (λ) to determine its color. The relationship between energy (in electron-volts, eV) and wavelength (in nanometers, nm) is given by the formula:\n    λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\n    Let's perform this calculation.\n\n    ```python\n    E_eV = 2.3393\n    # Use the conversion formula: lambda (nm) = 1240 / E (eV)\n    lambda_nm = 1240 / E_eV\n    print(f\"The wavelength of the emitted light is {lambda_nm:.2f} nm.\")\n    ```\n    Execution of the code gives the following output:\n    ```text\n    The wavelength of the emitted light is 530.07 nm.\n    ```\n3.  **Determine the Color of the Emitted Light:**\n    Now we match the calculated wavelength to the colors of the visible spectrum:\n    *   Violet: ~400–450 nm\n    *   Blue: ~450–495 nm\n    *   **Green: ~495–570 nm**\n    *   Yellow: ~570–590 nm\n    *   Orange: ~590–620 nm\n    *   Red: ~620–750 nm\n\n    A wavelength of 530.07 nm falls squarely in the **Green** region of the spectrum. So, the dye emits green light.\n\n4.  **Determine the Color of the Absorbed Light:**\n    Based on the principle of the Stokes shift, the absorbed light must have a higher energy and a shorter wavelength than the emitted light. The emitted wavelength is ~530 nm (Green). We need to find the option that represents a color with a wavelength shorter than 530 nm.\n\n    Let's examine the options:\n    *   A) Yellow: Wavelength is ~570-590 nm (longer than 530 nm, lower energy).\n    *   B) Violet: Wavelength is ~400-450 nm (shorter than 530 nm, higher energy).\n    *   C) Blue: Wavelength is ~450-495 nm (shorter than 530 nm, higher energy).\n    *   D) Red: Wavelength is ~620-750 nm (longer than 530 nm, lower energy).\n\n    Both Violet and Blue are possible answers as they have higher energy than Green. However, for most fluorescent dyes, the absorption and emission bands are relatively close to each other. The emission band is typically in the color band immediately adjacent to the absorption band on the longer wavelength (lower energy) side.\n\n    Since the emission is in the Green region, the absorption is most likely to be in the adjacent higher-energy region, which is **Blue**. Absorbing blue light and emitting green light is a very common pattern for fluorescent dyes (e.g., fluorescein).\n\n<<<C>>>"
