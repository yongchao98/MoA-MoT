    "An organic compound shows optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is often due to the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups) or due to axial, planar, or helical chirality. Let's analyze each of the given compounds.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are connected by a carbon-carbon single bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the positions ortho to the bond connecting the rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), free rotation around the C-C single bond is restricted. In this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   This steric hindrance forces the two rings into a non-planar conformation. Due to the substitution pattern, this non-planar molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. A molecule that is non-superimposable on its mirror image due to hindered rotation is called an atropisomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an ester derived from lactic acid, with the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. It is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon atom is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes it chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound contains a chiral center, is therefore a chiral molecule, and exhibits optical isomerism. It exists as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is not planar, as the phenyl rings are twisted relative to the C=O plane. However, the molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group. A molecule with an axis of rotation is not necessarily achiral, but benzophenone's symmetry makes it superimposable on its mirror image. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is trans-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). This molecule also possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct options are compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
