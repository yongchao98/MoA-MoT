    "My reasoning for solving this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P3 / P1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   System of three exoplanets (Planet1, P2, P3) orbiting the same star.\n    *   Circular orbits.\n    *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4 and T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3.\n    *   Ratio of masses: M1 / M2 ≈ 1.15 and M2 / M3 ≈ 1.35. This information is context from the TTV discovery method and is not needed for the calculation, as Kepler's third law for planets around the same star is independent of the planets' masses.\n    *   Albedo (A) is the same for all three planets (A = 0.3). The specific value is not needed, only that it is constant for all planets.\n\n3.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = [L_star * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * d^2)]^(1/4)`\n    where `L_star` is the star's luminosity, `A` is the albedo, `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and `d` is the orbital distance.\n    Since `L_star`, `A`, and `σ` are the same for all planets in this system, the formula simplifies to a proportionality:\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / d^(1/2)`\n    This can be rearranged to express the orbital distance `d` in terms of `T_eq`:\n    `d ∝ T_eq^(-2)` or `d ∝ 1 / T_eq^2`\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance:**\n    According to Kepler's Third Law for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3`\n    For circular orbits, the semi-major axis `a` is the same as the orbital distance `d`. So:\n    `P^2 ∝ d^3`\n\n5.  **Combine the Relationships to Link Period and Temperature:**\n    Now I can substitute the relationship from step 3 into the relationship from step 4 to find a direct link between the orbital period `P` and the equilibrium temperature `T_eq`.\n    `P^2 ∝ (T_eq^(-2))^3`\n    `P^2 ∝ T_eq^(-6)`\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    `P ∝ T_eq^(-3)` or `P ∝ 1 / T_eq^3`\n    This means the ratio of the periods of two planets (e.g., Planet_x and Planet_y) is related to their temperatures as follows:\n    `P_x / P_y = (T_eq_x / T_eq_y)^(-3) = (T_eq_y / T_eq_x)^3`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Required Ratio:**\n    I need to find `P3 / P1`. Using the formula from step 5:\n    `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3`\n    First, I must find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` using the given temperature ratios:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n    Now, I can substitute this value back into the period ratio equation:\n    `P3 / P1 = (3.22)^3`\n\n7.  **Final Computation:**\n    To get the final numerical answer, I will calculate `(3.22)^3`.\n    ```python\n    # Given ratios\n    T_eq1_over_T_eq2 = 1.4\n    T_eq2_over_T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n    # Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperature of Planet1 to Planet3\n    T_eq1_over_T_eq3 = T_eq1_over_T_eq2 * T_eq2_over_T_eq3\n\n    # The relationship between orbital period (P) and equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is P ∝ T_eq^(-3).\n    # Therefore, P3/P1 = (T_eq3/T_eq1)^(-3) = (T_eq1/T_eq3)^3.\n    P3_over_P1 = T_eq1_over_T_eq3**3\n\n    print(P3_over_P1)\n    ```\n    execution_result:\n    33.386248000000005\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 33.4. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) ~ 4.4\nB) ~ 10.4\nC) ~ 33.4\nD) ~ 3.2\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
