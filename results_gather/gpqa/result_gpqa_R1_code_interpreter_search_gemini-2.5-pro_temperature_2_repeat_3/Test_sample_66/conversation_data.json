    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the basis.**\n    The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1$: orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2=1$: orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l=2$: total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m=-1$: the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n    This state is an eigenstate of the operators $L^2$ (total angular momentum squared) and $L_z$ (z-component of total angular momentum). The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the final state corresponding to the measurement outcome.**\n    The measurement is of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   We want to find the outcome where the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   We want to find the outcome where the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    The state corresponding to this specific measurement outcome is an uncoupled state, represented by the ket $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Relate the total z-component to individual components.**\n    The operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    Similarly, the corresponding quantum numbers are related by the sum: $m = m_1 + m_2$. This is a fundamental selection rule in the coupling of angular momentum.\n\n4.  **Apply the selection rule to the problem.**\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ has a total z-component quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   The final (measured) state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ corresponds to individual quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The total z-component quantum number for this state would be $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, and finding it in the state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the two states:\n    $P = |\\langle \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    The inner product $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l_1, l_2, l, m \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A key property (selection rule) of these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n    In our case, we compare the total z-component quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum of the z-component quantum numbers of the final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$).\n    Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n    This can also be understood from a more fundamental principle: the initial state is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final state is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) that correspond to different eigenvalues are necessarily orthogonal. Therefore, their inner product is zero.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion.**\n    Since the inner product is zero, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nIt is physically impossible for a system with a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$ to be found in a state where the sum of its parts' z-components is $-2\\hbar$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
