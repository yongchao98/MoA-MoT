    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the element and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic weight of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The mass fraction is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the atomic weight of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 19.00 = n * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = n * (12.9276) / 0.3196\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.5 g/mol (Calcium, but doesn't fit other criteria).\n    *   n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Bromine, but only has 3 main fluorides).\n    *   n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (Antimony, but only has 2 main fluorides).\n    *   n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Dysprosium/Terbium, do not have 5 fluorides or fit the reactivity).\n    *   n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol (Mercury/Thallium/Lead, do not fit the criteria).\n    *   n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Plutonium/Americium, actinides). Pu fits the reactivity but leads to contradictions.\n\n    Let's check non-metal halogens. Iodine (I) has an atomic weight of 126.9 g/mol.\n    If Y = I, then 126.9 ≈ 40.45 * n, which gives n ≈ 3.13. This suggests that n=3 is a very strong possibility.\n    Let's check if A2 = IF3.\n    The theoretical mass fraction of fluorine in IF3 is:\n    M(IF3) = 126.9 + 3 * 19.0 = 183.9 g/mol\n    ɷF(IF3) = (3 * 19.0) / 183.9 = 57.0 / 183.9 ≈ 0.3100 or 31.00%.\n    This value is very close to the given 31.96%. Chemistry problems from competitions can sometimes have slight inaccuracies in the provided data. This is the most plausible identification. So, we'll proceed with Y = Iodine (I) and A2 = IF3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Properties of the Other Compounds.**\n    *   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y (Iodine) are known.\"** The main iodine fluorides are IF, IF3, IF5, and IF7. To reach five, one might count unstable species or dimers like I2F6. We'll assume this condition is met.\n    *   **\"A1 is a bright-red substance...\"**: This clue is problematic, as the common higher iodine fluorides (IF5, IF7) are colorless. This may be a red herring or an error in the problem statement. We can solve for A4 without a definitive identification of A1.\n    *   **\"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\"**: This is a key clue for identifying A4. A4 is one of the iodine fluorides. Let's look at their properties:\n        *   IF: Unstable solid, decomposes. Cannot form a hot concentrated solution.\n        *   IF3: Yellow solid, decomposes above -28°C. Cannot form a hot concentrated solution.\n        *   IF5: A stable, colorless liquid (m.p. 9.4 °C, b.p. 104.5 °C). It can exist as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" (it can be the solution itself). This is a perfect match.\n        *   IF7: A colorless gas at room temperature. Cannot form a hot concentrated solution.\n    Based on physical properties, **A4 must be IF5**.\n\n3.  **Confirm the Identification of A4 with the Reaction Clues.**\n    *   **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"**\n        *   Element Y is Iodine, which exists as I2. So, we add I2 to A4 (which we identified as IF5).\n        *   The reaction is: `I2 + IF5 -> A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio.\n        *   This could be the formation of a stable adduct, A5 = I2·IF5. This satisfies the 1:1 stoichiometry.\n    *   **\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"**\n        *   A5 (I2·IF5) would react with water. Iodine fluorides hydrolyze to form hydrofluoric acid (HF) and an iodine oxyacid (like HIO3). The iodine (I2) may remain. For example: `I2 + IF5 + 3H2O -> I2 + 5HF + HIO3`. In any case, it decomposes into multiple substances, fitting the clue.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Our identification leads to A4 being iodine pentafluoride (IF5).\n    Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(A4) = M(IF5) = M(I) + 5 * M(F)\n    M(IF5) = 126.9 g/mol + 5 * 19.0 g/mol = 126.9 + 95.0 = 221.9 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Ranges.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 221.9 g/mol. We now check which range this value falls into:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 221.9 g/mol falls within the range 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>"
