    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let `S` be the laboratory frame (the observer's frame), which we consider stationary.\n    *   Let `S'` be the rest frame of the glass. The glass is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame `S`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **v**: The velocity of the glass (frame `S'`) with respect to the laboratory (frame `S`). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   **u'**: The velocity of the light beam with respect to the glass (in frame `S'`). The speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass, as measured in the glass's rest frame, is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **u**: The velocity of the light beam with respect to the laboratory (in frame `S`). This is the quantity we need to calculate.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Principle:**\n    Since the problem involves velocities that can be close to the speed of light and different frames of reference, we must use the principles of Special Relativity, specifically the relativistic velocity addition formula. The classical (Galilean) addition of velocities (`u = u' + v`) is not accurate in this context.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Algebraic Expression:**\n    To simplify this complex fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    B) 1\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
