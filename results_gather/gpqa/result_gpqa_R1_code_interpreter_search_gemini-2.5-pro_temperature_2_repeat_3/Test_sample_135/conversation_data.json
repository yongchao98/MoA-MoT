    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\n*   **Vector Field (f):** The problem describes a vector field `f(r)`.\n    *   Its magnitude is `1/r^2`, where `r` is the radial distance from the origin.\n    *   Its direction is purely radial.\n    *   In spherical coordinates, this can be written as the vector `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n*   **Objective:** We need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field. This is written as `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n*   **Volume of Integration (V):** The integration is performed over the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n### 2. Choosing the Method\n\nThere are two primary ways to solve this:\n1.  Directly calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrate it over the volume. This method can be tricky because the field is singular at the origin `r=0`.\n2.  Use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem), which relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field itself. This method is often much simpler for this type of problem.\n\nWe will use the Divergence Theorem as it is the most efficient method.\n\n### 3. Applying the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS`\n\nWhere:\n*   `V` is the volume (the sphere of radius R).\n*   `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V` (the surface of the sphere of radius R).\n*   `n̂` is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface `S`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area element.\n\nThe theorem essentially says that the integral of all the \"sources\" (divergence) inside a volume is equal to the total \"flux\" (flow) of the field out of the surface enclosing that volume.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Surface Integral\n\nLet's evaluate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, `∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS`.\n\n*   **Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On the surface of the sphere, the radial distance `r` is always equal to the radius `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n\n*   **Outward Normal Vector (n̂):** For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward-pointing normal vector at any point on the surface is simply the radial unit vector `r̂`. So, `n̂ = r̂`.\n\n*   **The Dot Product (f ⋅ n̂):** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the normal vector on the surface.\n    `f ⋅ n̂ = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [r̂]`\n    Since `r̂` is a unit vector, `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`.\n    `f ⋅ n̂ = 1/R^2`\n\n*   **The Surface Integral:** Now we substitute this constant value back into the surface integral:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n\n    Since `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, the term `1/R^2` is constant over the entire surface of integration. We can pull it out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\n    The integral `∮_S dS` simply means \"sum up all the tiny area elements over the entire surface,\" which is just the total surface area of the sphere. The formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\n    So, `∮_S dS = 4πR^2`.\n\n*   **Final Calculation:** Putting it all together:\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2) = 4π`\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral we wanted to find is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS = 4π`\n\n**Note on the singularity:** The vector field `f = r̂/r^2` is undefined at the origin `r=0`. While this technically violates a condition of the Divergence Theorem, the theorem is routinely and correctly used for such cases in physics (e.g., Gauss's Law for an electric point charge). The physical interpretation is that the singularity at the origin acts as a point source, and the integral of the divergence correctly calculates the total strength of this source, which is `4π`. A more rigorous mathematical proof involves excluding an infinitesimal sphere around the origin and taking a limit, which yields the same result.\n\nThe calculated value is `4π`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 4 π\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
