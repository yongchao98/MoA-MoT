    "Answering this question involves applying the principles of binary star dynamics, specifically relating observational quantities (period and radial velocity) to the physical property of mass.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (let's call it `M_total_1`) to the total mass of system_2 (`M_total_2`). So, we need to calculate `M_total_1 / M_total_2`.\n\n2.  **Gather the Given Data:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (`P1`) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (`K1a`, `K1b`) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (`P2`) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (`K2a`, `K2b`) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify Key Information and Assumptions:**\n    *   The systems are described as \"double-lined spectroscopic binaries\" because we have radial velocity data for both stars.\n    *   The problem states that both systems \"exhibit eclipses.\" This is crucial information. For an eclipse to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the binary system. This means the inclination angle `i` of the orbit is close to 90°. When `i` ≈ 90°, `sin(i)` ≈ 1. This simplifies the calculations significantly.\n    *   The \"sinusoidal variations\" of radial velocity imply that the orbits are approximately circular, which is a standard assumption for this type of problem.\n\n4.  **Select the Relevant Physics Formula:**\n    The total mass (`M_total` = M₁ + M₂) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be related to its orbital period (`P`) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (`K₁`, `K₂`) using Kepler's Third Law. The derived formula is:\n    `M_total * sin³(i) = P * (K₁ + K₂)^3 / (2 * π * G)`\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n5.  **Apply the Assumption:**\n    Since both systems are eclipsing, we assume `i` ≈ 90° and therefore `sin(i)` ≈ 1, which means `sin³(i)` ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\n    `M_total ≈ P * (K₁ + K₂)^3 / (2 * π * G)`\n\n6.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    We need to find the ratio `M_total_1 / M_total_2`.\n    `M_total_1 ≈ P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3 / (2 * π * G)`\n    `M_total_2 ≈ P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3 / (2 * π * G)`\n\n    When we divide these two equations, the constant term `(2 * π * G)` cancels out:\n    `Ratio = M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P1 / P2) * [(K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b)]^3`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Values for Each System:**\n    *   **For System 1:**\n        *   `P1 = 2` years\n        *   `K1_total = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   **For System 2:**\n        *   `P2 = 1` year\n        *   `K2_total = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n    Note: The units (years, km/s) are consistent for both systems in the ratio, so their conversion factors to SI units (seconds, m/s) will cancel out. We can use the given numbers directly.\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Ratio:**\n    Substitute the calculated values into the ratio formula. This can be done with a simple python script.\n\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_total = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_total = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio of total masses (M_total_1 / M_total_2)\n# Ratio = (P1 / P2) * ((K1_total / K2_total)**3)\nratio = (P1 / P2) * ((K1_total / K2_total) ** 3)\n\nprint(f\"{ratio=}\")\n```\n<execute_return>\n```text\nratio=0.432\n```\n</execute_return>\nThe computed ratio is 0.432. This value is closest to the provided option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The relationship between the total mass `M` of a double-lined, eclipsing binary system, its orbital period `P`, and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes `(K₁ + K₂)` is given by a simplified version of Kepler's Third Law:\n`M ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)^3`\nThis holds true because the systems are eclipsing, which implies an inclination `i` of approximately 90°, making `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. The proportionality constant involves universal constants like `G`, which will cancel out when we take a ratio.\n\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses, `M₁_total / M₂_total`.\n\n**Given Data:**\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period `P₁ = 2` years\n    *   Velocity amplitudes `K₁a = 10` km/s, `K₁b = 5` km/s\n    *   Sum of amplitudes `(K₁_total) = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period `P₂ = 1` year\n    *   Velocity amplitudes `K₂a = 15` km/s, `K₂b = 10` km/s\n    *   Sum of amplitudes `(K₂_total) = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s\n\n**Calculation:**\nWe can set up the ratio as follows:\n`M₁_total / M₂_total = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n\nPlugging in the values:\n`M₁_total / M₂_total = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n`M₁_total / M₂_total = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³`\n`M₁_total / M₂_total = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n`M₁_total / M₂_total = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`M₁_total / M₂_total = 54 / 125`\n`M₁_total / M₂_total = 0.432`\n\nThis value of approximately 0.432 is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
