    "*   **1. Lorentz Symmetry:** The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is built upon the framework of relativistic quantum field theory. A fundamental tenet of this framework is the invariance of physical laws under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). The Lagrangian of SMEFT, which includes the Standard Model Lagrangian plus all higher-dimensional operators, is constructed to be a Lorentz scalar. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.\n\n*   **2. Poincare symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is the group of spacetime isometries and includes Lorentz transformations as well as spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime assumed in any relativistic quantum field theory. The requirement that the laws of physics are the same everywhere (translational invariance) is essential. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry.\n\n*   **3. CP symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model, specifically by the weak interaction as described by the CKM matrix. Since the baseline theory (the SM) already violates CP, there is no requirement to impose this symmetry on the higher-dimensional operators that extend it. In fact, these new operators can introduce new sources of CP violation. Therefore, SMEFT operators do not necessarily respect CP symmetry.\n\n*   **4. CPT symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n*   1. Lorentz Symmetry - **Yes**\n*   2. Poincare symmetry - **Yes**\n*   3. CP symmetry - **No**\n*   4. CPT symmetry - **Yes**\n\nThis corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
