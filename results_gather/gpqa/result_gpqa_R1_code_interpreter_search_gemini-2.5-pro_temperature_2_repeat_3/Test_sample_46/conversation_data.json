    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    First, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one other double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct peaks in this region (3500-3300 cm-1) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). This suggests the compound contains a -NH2 group. A primary amide (-CONH2) also shows two bands, but a secondary amide (like in option D) would show only one.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency gives clues to the type of carbonyl group.\n        *   Standard alkyl esters (-COOR) are typically around 1750-1735 cm-1.\n        *   Amides (-CONH2) are typically lower, around 1690-1650 cm-1.\n        *   The value of 1720 cm-1 is slightly low for a simple ester, which suggests the ester group is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. The presence of an electron-donating group on the ring (like -NH2) can further lower this frequency. This piece of data points towards a conjugated ester, such as an aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 hydrogens indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 hydrogens indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) signifies that this -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen.\n    *   Putting these two signals together (the triplet at 1.20 and the quartet at 4.5), we can confidently identify an **ethoxy group (-O-CH2-CH3)**. The chemical shift of the quartet is consistent with it being part of an ester (-COO-CH2-CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 hydrogens. This is consistent with the protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group identified from the IR spectrum. The protons on nitrogen are often broad due to chemical exchange and quadrupole coupling.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 hydrogens, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents have different electronic effects. The protons near the electron-donating group are shielded (appear at a lower ppm, upfield), while the protons near the electron-withdrawing group are deshielded (appear at a higher ppm, downfield).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    From the fragments identified:\n    1.  A primary amine (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group.\n    2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n    3.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n    Let's place these groups on the para-disubstituted ring. This gives us **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   The structure is H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3.\n    *   The aromatic protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group are expected to be upfield (around 7.0 ppm).\n    *   The aromatic protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group are expected to be downfield (around 8.0 ppm).\n    *   This matches the NMR data perfectly. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula. All spectral data points are consistent with this structure.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Other Options**\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is H2N-C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH3. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CO-CH2- group around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n    *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. Also, the NMR would have a signal for the formyl proton (-CHO) above 8 ppm, which is absent.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of all the spectral data, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the only compound that fits all the evidence.\n\n<<<A>>>"
