    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). The broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group class but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) described in the 1H NMR data.\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This confirms there are no C=C double bonds in the molecule, which is consistent with all four structures.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern arises when a single proton (or a set of equivalent protons) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (2+1=3).\n    *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet (3+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with a {1H, 2H, 3H} set of neighbors. The order (dtq vs. tqd vs. qdt, etc.) depends on the relative sizes of the coupling constants (J-values), but the set of neighbors must be the same.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), giving a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), giving a **t**riplet.\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), giving another **t**riplet.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} set of neighbors.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the local environment of the methine (CH) protons in each structure to see if they match the required splitting patterns.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the -CH₂- of the ethyl group (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H). This is a {1H, 2H, 3H} environment, which would produce a **dtq** (or tqd/qdt). This matches one signal.\n*   H at C2: Coupled to the H at C3 (1H), the -CH₃ on C2 (3H), and the -COOH proton (1H). This is a {1H, 3H, 1H} environment, which would produce a doublet of quartets of doublets (dqd). This does not match the `dtt` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**B) (CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to the H at C4 (1H), the -CH₂- group (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H). This is a {1H, 2H, 3H} environment, producing a **dtq**. This matches one signal.\n*   H at C4: Coupled to the H at C3 (1H) and the two -CH₃ groups of the isopropyl tail (6H). This is a {1H, 6H} environment, producing a doublet of septets. This does not match the `dtt` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to H at C2 (1H), the -CH₂- of the C4-ethyl group (2H), and the -CH₂- of its own C3-ethyl group (2H). This is a {1H, 2H, 2H} environment, which would produce a **dtt**. This matches one signal.\n*   H at C2: Coupled to H at C3 (1H), the -CH₂- of its own C2-ethyl group (2H), and the -COOH proton (1H). This is a {1H, 2H, 1H} environment, which would produce a doublet of triplets of doublets (dtd). This does not match the `dtq` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n**C) CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH**\nLet's analyze the structure based on the provided formula, assuming a backbone of `CH3-CH-CH-CH2-COOH`. Let's label the methine protons H_a and H_b.\n`CH₃ - CH_a(C₂H₅) - CH_b(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`\n\n*   **Proton H_a**: Let's identify its neighbors.\n    *   On the adjacent methyl group: 3 protons.\n    *   The adjacent methine proton: H_b (1 proton).\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) of the ethyl group attached to its carbon: 2 protons.\n    *   The set of neighbors is **{3H, 1H, 2H}**. This will produce a **quartet of doublets of triplets (qdt)**, which is a permutation of `dtq`. **This is a match.**\n\n*   **Proton H_b**: Let's identify its neighbors.\n    *   The adjacent methine proton: H_a (1 proton).\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) next to the carboxylic acid: 2 protons.\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) of the ethyl group attached to its carbon: 2 protons.\n    *   The set of neighbors is **{1H, 2H, 2H}**. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. **This is a match.**\n\n*   **Result:** Correct. This structure is the only one that possesses one proton with a {1H, 2H, 3H} neighborhood (`dtq`) and a different proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} neighborhood (`dtt`).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the 1H NMR splitting patterns, compound C is the only candidate that matches the experimental data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
