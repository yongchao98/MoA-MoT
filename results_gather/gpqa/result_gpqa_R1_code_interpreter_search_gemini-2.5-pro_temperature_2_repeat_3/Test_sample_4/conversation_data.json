    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$, which is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon. The components are given in terms of the Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$.\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Define the direction vector:**\n    The problem states that the direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in spherical coordinates is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (angle from the z-axis) and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (angle from the x-axis in the x-y plane).\n    For a vector in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. This means $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. We can achieve this by setting $\\phi=0$.\n    So, the unit vector for the direction is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the operator along the direction  $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{P}$.\n    $P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$\n    $P_n = (\\sin\\theta) P_x + (0) P_y + (\\cos\\theta) P_z$\n    $P_n = \\sin\\theta \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x\\right) + \\cos\\theta \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z\\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sin\\theta \\sigma_x + \\cos\\theta \\sigma_z)$\n\n    Now, substitute the matrix forms:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\\\ 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta - 1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the eigenvalue equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector, let's call it $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$, corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve the equation for the eigenvector components:**\n    We can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides of the equation:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    This matrix equation represents a system of two linear equations:\n    (1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    (2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's rearrange the first equation:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    Using trigonometric half-angle identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n    So,\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    This gives the relationship $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n    (We could have used the second equation as well, which would yield the same result).\n\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can choose $a$ to be any non-zero complex number. Let's choose $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$ for simplicity.\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n6.  **Normalize the eigenvector:**\n    The norm of the eigenvector must be 1. Let's check the norm of our result:\n    $\\| \\psi \\|^2 = (\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n    The vector is already normalized.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
