    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. As the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star moves towards and away from us, causing its spectral lines to shift to the blue and red, respectively.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The observed maximum wavelength shift (`Δλ_max`) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (`K`). The relationship is given by the Doppler formula:\n    `Δλ_max / λ = K / c`\n    Where `λ` is the rest wavelength and `c` is the speed of light.\n    This means `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of Radial Velocity Amplitudes:**\n    We are given the maximum periodic wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   `Δλ_max1` = 5 milliangstroms\n    *   `Δλ_max2` = 7 milliangstroms\n\n    The ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes is therefore:\n    `K2 / K1 = Δλ_max2 / Δλ_max1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4`\n\n4.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n    `K = ( (2πG) / T )^(1/3) * ( m_p * sin(i) ) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where:\n    *   `T` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `m_p` is the mass of the planet.\n    *   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Given Information and Simplify the Formula:** The problem provides key information that allows for simplification:\n    *   \"two stars with exactly the same masses\": `M_star1 = M_star2`.\n    *   \"both with masses similar to that of Neptune\": In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the *minimum mass*, `m_p * sin(i)`. This statement implies that `m_p1 * sin(i1)` is approximately equal to `m_p2 * sin(i2)`.\n    *   The term `(2πG)` is a constant.\n\n    Because `M_star` and `m_p * sin(i)` are the same for both systems, we can see that `K` is proportional to `T^(-1/3)`:\n    `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`\n\n6.  **Set up the Ratio of Periods:** Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can write a ratio for the two systems:\n    `(K2 / K1) = (T2 / T1)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `(K2 / K1) = (T1 / T2)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Solve for the Period Ratio (T2 / T1):**\n    *   Substitute the known value of `K2 / K1`:\n        `1.4 = (T1 / T2)^(1/3)`\n    *   To solve for the period ratio, first cube both sides of the equation:\n        `1.4^3 = T1 / T2`\n        `2.744 = T1 / T2`\n    *   The question asks for the orbital period of planet #2 *longer than* planet #1, which means we need the ratio `T2 / T1`. So, we take the reciprocal:\n        `T2 / T1 = 1 / 2.744`\n    *   Calculate the final value:\n        `T2 / T1 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value `~0.36` matches option A. A sanity check confirms this: Planet #2 causes a larger velocity shift (K2 > K1), which implies it has a shorter orbital period (T2 < T1). Therefore, the ratio `T2 / T1` must be less than 1.\n\n```python\n# Calculate 1.4 cubed\nval_cubed = 1.4 ** 3\n\n# Calculate the reciprocal to find T2 / T1\nratio = 1 / val_cubed\n\nprint(f\"The ratio T2/T1 is approximately: {ratio:.4f}\")\n```\nExecution Output:\n```\nThe ratio T2/T1 is approximately: 0.3644\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 (`T2`) to that of planet #1 (`T1`).\n\n1.  **Relating Observed Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity**\n    The radial velocity method relies on the Doppler effect. The fractional wavelength shift (`Δλ/λ`) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (`v_r`) of the star along the line of sight: `Δλ/λ = v_r/c`.\n    The maximum observed wavelength shift (`Δλ_max`) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is the semi-amplitude `K`.\n    Therefore, `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`.\n    *   For planet #1, `Δλ_max1` = 5 milliangstroms. Let its stellar velocity semi-amplitude be `K1`.\n    *   For planet #2, `Δλ_max2` = 7 milliangstroms. Let its stellar velocity semi-amplitude be `K2`.\n\n    The ratio of the stellar velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n    `K2 / K1 = Δλ_max2 / Δλ_max1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4`\n\n2.  **Relating Stellar Velocity to Orbital Period**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is given by:\n    `K = [ (2πG) / T ]^(1/3) * ( m_p * sin(i) ) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where:\n    *   `T` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `m_p` is the planet's mass.\n    *   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n    *   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Equation based on Given Information**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses, which in the context of the RV method implies the measured *minimum mass* (`m_p * sin(i)`) is the same for both. This is because the signal amplitude depends on this combined term.\n\n    Since `G`, `m_p * sin(i)`, and `M_star` are the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to a proportionality:\n    `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)` or `K ∝ T^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n    We can write the relationship between the two systems as a ratio:\n    `K2 / K1 = (T2 / T1)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rearranged as:\n    `K2 / K1 = (T1 / T2)^(1/3)`\n\n    Now, substitute the value of `K2 / K1` we found earlier:\n    `1.4 = (T1 / T2)^(1/3)`\n\n    To solve for `T2/T1`, first cube both sides:\n    `(1.4)^3 = T1 / T2`\n    `2.744 = T1 / T2`\n\n    The question asks for the ratio `T2 / T1`, so we take the reciprocal:\n    `T2 / T1 = 1 / 2.744`\n    `T2 / T1 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
