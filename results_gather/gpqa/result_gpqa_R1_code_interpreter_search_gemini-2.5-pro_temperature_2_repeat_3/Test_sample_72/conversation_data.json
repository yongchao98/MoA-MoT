    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **Part 1: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nThe problem involves objects moving at relativistic speeds, so we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. The formula for the relative velocity (`v_rel`) of astronaut 1 (with velocity `v1`) with respect to astronaut 2 (with velocity `v2`) is:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\n**Given:**\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\n**Calculation:**\n1.  Plug the values into the formula:\n    `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n\n2.  Simplify the numerator and the term in the denominator:\n    `v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3 * c^2) / c^2)`\n    `v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n\n3.  Perform the final calculation:\n    `v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n    `v_rel = (1/7) * c`\n\n4.  Convert the fraction to a decimal:\n    `v_rel ≈ 0.142857 c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is `0.14c`.\n\n### **Part 2: Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic system is the sum of the total energies of its individual components. The total energy (`E`) of a single particle with rest mass `m0` and velocity `v` is given by:\n\n`E = γ * m0 * c^2`\n\nwhere `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is:\n\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`\n\nThe total energy of the system (`E_total`) is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts (`E1 + E2`).\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Rest mass: `m1 = 2m`\n*   Velocity: `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Calculate `γ1`:\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Calculate `E1`:\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 * mc^2`\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Rest mass: `m2 = 3m`\n*   Velocity: `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   Calculate `γ2`:\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Calculate `E2`:\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.4641 * mc^2`\n\n**Total Energy (`E_total`):**\n*   Sum the energies `E1` and `E2`:\n    `E_total = E1 + E2 = (2.5 * mc^2) + (3.4641 * mc^2)`\n    `E_total = (2.5 + 3.4641) * mc^2`\n    `E_total = 5.9641 * mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is `5.96 mc^2`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The relative speed is `v_rel = 0.14c`.\n*   The total energy of the system is `E = 5.96 mc^2`.\n\nThis matches the values in option C.\n\nTo be certain of the calculations, we can use a script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\nv1_coeff = 0.6  # velocity of astronaut 1 in terms of c\nv2_coeff = 0.5  # velocity of astronaut 2 in terms of c\nm1_coeff = 2    # mass of astronaut 1 in terms of m\nm2_coeff = 3    # mass of astronaut 2 in terms of m\n\n# --- 1.
