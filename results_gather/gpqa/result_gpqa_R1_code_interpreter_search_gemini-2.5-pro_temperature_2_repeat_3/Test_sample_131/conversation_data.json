    "Here is my step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n    *   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   **1H NMR Data of the Mixture:**\n        *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n        *   Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n    *   **Options:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)\n        *   1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n2.  **Verify Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4): 6C (ring) + 4C (methyls) = 10C. 2H (ring) + 12H (methyls) = 14H. Formula C10H14 is correct for all three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2): 6C (ring) + 4C (ethyls) = 10C. 4H (ring) + 10H (ethyls) = 14H. Formula C10H14 is also correct.\n    All four compounds are isomers and fit the molecular formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound:**\n    This analysis focuses on symmetry to predict the number of signals and their splitting patterns.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are chemically equivalent. This will produce a single **singlet** integrating to 4H.\n        *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. They will produce a **quartet** (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and a **triplet** (for the 6H of the CH3 groups).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a quartet and triplet contradicts the data, which states there are only singlets in the alkyl region. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates option **C**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons at positions 5 and 6. They are adjacent to each other. Due to symmetry, they are chemically equivalent, but because they are coupled to each other (and to the methyl groups differently), they are magnetically non-equivalent. This will lead to splitting. The signal will appear as an **AB quartet or a pair of doublets**, not as singlets.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a non-singlet signal in the aromatic region contradicts the data. Therefore, **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates options **A** and **D**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Remaining Option:**\n    By elimination, the only remaining possibility is option **B**, which is a mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the observed spectrum.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This is a highly symmetrical molecule.\n        *   **Aromatic:** Two equivalent protons (H-3, H-6). This gives **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   **Alkyl:** Four equivalent methyl groups. This gives **one singlet** (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has less symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic:** Two non-equivalent protons (H-4 and H-6). They are not adjacent, so they will appear as **two separate singlets** (1H each).\n        *   **Alkyl:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups based on their environment. The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent, the group at C2 is unique, and the group at C5 is unique. This results in **three singlets** with integrals of 6H, 3H, and 3H (which is a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture (Durene + Isodurene):**\n    Now, we combine the spectra of the two compounds in a 1:1 ratio and see if it matches the experimental data, allowing for potential accidental overlaps of signals with very similar chemical shifts.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n        *   **Signals available:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets.\n        *   **Observation:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n        *   **Explanation:** The total number of aromatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 2H (from Durene) + (1H + 1H) (from Isodurene) = 4H. For two signals to have a 1:1 ratio, each must integrate to 2H. This can occur if:\n            *   Signal 1 is the 2H singlet from Durene.\n            *   Signal 2 is a single 2H peak formed by the accidental overlap of the two 1H singlets from Isodurene.\n        *   This configuration perfectly matches the observed data.\n\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n        *   **Signals available:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Observation:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n        *   **Explanation:** The total number of alkyl protons is 12H (Durene) + (6H + 3H + 3H) (Isodurene) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24H means the signals must have integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This can occur if:\n            *   Signal 1 (relative intensity 2) is the 12H singlet from Durene.\n            *   Signal 2 (relative intensity 1) is the 6H singlet from Isodurene.\n            *   Signal 3 (relative intensity 1) is a 6H peak formed by the accidental overlap of the two 3H singlets from Isodurene.\n        *   This configuration also perfectly matches the observed data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe process of elimination definitively rules out options A, C, and D. A detailed analysis of option B shows that a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is fully consistent with all the information given in the 1H NMR spectrum, assuming some plausible accidental overlaps of signals.\n\n<<<B>>>"
