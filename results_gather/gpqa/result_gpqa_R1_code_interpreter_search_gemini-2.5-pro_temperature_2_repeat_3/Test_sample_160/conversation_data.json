    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding Mean Free Path (λ)\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It is defined by the formula:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles. In this problem, the number density of gas molecules is the same in both scenarios since the temperature, pressure, and volume of the sample compartment are constant.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\nThe problem asks to compare two different mean free paths:\n*   **λ1**: The mean free path of gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   **λ2**: The mean free path of high-energy electrons colliding with the same gas molecules.\n\nSince `n` is constant, the relationship between λ1 and λ2 is determined by the inverse of the relationship between their respective collision cross-sections (σ1 and σ2):\n\nλ2 / λ1 = σ1_effective / σ2_effective\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Collision Cross-Sections\n\nWe need to compare the effective collision cross-section for gas-gas collisions (σ1_effective) with the collision cross-section for electron-gas collisions (σ2_effective).\n\n*   **σ1 (Gas-Gas Collision):** This collision is governed by short-range intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces). The collision occurs when two molecules get very close to each other. The effective cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules. For collisions between identical moving molecules of diameter `d`, the formula for the mean free path includes a √2 factor to account for the movement of all particles:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_kinetic)\n    where σ_kinetic = πd². So, σ1_effective = √2 * πd².\n\n*   **σ2 (Electron-Gas Collision):** This collision involves a high-energy (1000 keV), negatively charged electron and a neutral gas molecule. The interaction is the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force between the electron and the atom's charged constituents (the positive nucleus and negative electron cloud). The question is, how does the cross-section for this interaction compare to the gas-kinetic cross-section?\n\n### 3. High-Energy Particle Behavior\n\nA common misconception is that a charged particle will always interact more strongly than a neutral one, leading to a larger cross-section. While the Coulomb force is long-range, the outcome depends critically on the projectile's energy.\n\nHigh-energy particles, such as the 1000 kV electrons in this scenario, are highly relativistic and travel at near the speed of light. They pass by the target gas molecules so quickly that the interaction time is extremely short. This short interaction time reduces the impulse transferred to the molecule (or the electron), meaning the electron must pass very close to the nucleus to be significantly deflected.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, this phenomenon is described as the scattering cross-section decreasing with increasing energy. For high energies, the atom becomes increasingly \"transparent\" to the passing electron. Search results from databases of physical data confirm this:\n*   The gas-kinetic cross-section for a typical molecule like N₂ is on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n*   The total scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron (in the keV to MeV range) on N₂ is on the order of 10⁻²⁰ to 10⁻²² m².\n\nTherefore, the electron-gas collision cross-section (σ2) is significantly **smaller** than the effective gas-gas collision cross-section (σ1).\n\nσ2 < σ1\n\n### 4. Comparing λ1 and λ2\n\nSince the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), and we've established that σ2 < σ1, it follows directly that:\n\nλ2 > λ1\n\nThis conclusion eliminates option **D) λ2 < λ1**. It also makes Mike's observation \"intriguing\" because it's counter-intuitive to the naive assumption that charged particles interact more.\n\n### 5. Choosing Between Options B and C\n\nNow we must decide between:\nB) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1\n\nOur analysis showed that σ2 is not just slightly smaller, but *significantly* smaller than σ1. Let's look at the ratio more formally:\nλ2 / λ1 = σ1_effective / σ2_effective = (√2 * πd²) / σ2\n\nFrom the data found, the ratio of the cross-sections (σ1/σ2) can be 10 or even more. This means the ratio of the mean free paths (λ2/λ1) will be large (>> 1.414).\n*   Option C suggests a very tight upper bound: λ2 must be less than 1.22 * λ1. This is inconsistent with the physics of high-energy scattering, which predicts a much larger ratio.\n*   Option B provides a lower bound: λ2 is at least 1.22 * λ1. This is fully consistent with our finding that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. If λ2/λ1 is, for example, 20, then the condition λ2/λ1 >= 1.22 is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the physics of the scenario strongly supports option B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mean free path of a particle is inversely proportional to its collision cross-section. For a high-energy electron (1000 keV), the scattering cross-section with a gas molecule (σ2) is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section between two gas molecules (σ1). This is because the high-speed electron has a very short interaction time with the target molecule, making it effectively \"see\" a smaller target. Since σ2 < σ1, the corresponding mean free path λ2 must be greater than λ1. The expected ratio λ2/λ1 is much larger than 1, making option B the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
