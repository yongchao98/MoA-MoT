    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System Properties:**\n    *   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its energy level quantum number `n` and its spin quantum number `m_s`.\n    *   **Potential Well and Energy Levels:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy levels are given by the formula:\n        E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n        where `n` is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    *   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a unit of energy E = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2). Therefore, we can express the single-particle energy levels as:\n        E_n = n^2 * E\n    *   **State Occupancy:** Since the particles are spin-1/2, their spin quantum number `m_s` can be +1/2 (spin up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin down, ↓). Due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n    *   **Level n=1 (Energy E_1 = 1^2 * E = E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   **Level n=2 (Energy E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n        E_ground = 2 * E_1 + 2 * E_2\n        E_ground = 2 * (E) + 2 * (4E)\n        E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n3.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_first):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   We promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   The total energy of this first excited state is:\n        E_first = 2 * E_1 + 1 * E_2 + 1 * E_3\n        E_first = 2 * (1^2 * E) + 1 * (2^2 * E) + 1 * (3^2 * E)\n        E_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n4.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_second):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible low-energy promotions from the ground state.\n    *   **Possibility 1 (already used for 1st excited state):** Promote a particle from n=2 to n=3. The total energy is 15E.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** Promote a particle from the n=1 level to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n        *   Ground State Configuration: {n=1: 2 particles, n=2: 2 particles}\n        *   New Configuration: {n=1: 1 particle, n=2: 2 particles, n=3: 1 particle}\n        *   The total energy is:\n            E = 1 * E_1 + 2 * E_2 + 1 * E_3\n            E = 1 * (1^2 * E) + 2 * (2^2 * E) + 1 * (3^2 * E)\n            E = 1E + 2 * (4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E\n    *   **Other Possibilities:** Other promotions, such as moving a particle from n=2 to n=4 or promoting two particles, will result in higher energies.\n        *   (e.g., promote two from n=2 to n=3): Energy = 2*E_1 + 2*E_3 = 2E + 2*(9E) = 20E.\n        *   (e.g., promote one from n=2 to n=4): Energy = 2*E_1 + 1*E_2 + 1*E_4 = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   Comparing the excited state energies (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), the second lowest energy after the ground state is 18E.\n    *   Therefore, the second excited state energy is E_second = 18E.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n*   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n*   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nMatching these values with the given options:\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\nB) 4E, 10E, 15E\nC) 4E, 10E, 50E\nD) 10E, 15E, 18E\n\nThe calculated energies match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
