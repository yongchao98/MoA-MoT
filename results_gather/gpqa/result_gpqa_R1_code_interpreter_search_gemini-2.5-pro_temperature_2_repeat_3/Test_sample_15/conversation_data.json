    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. A compound with stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is called a meso compound and is achiral (optically inactive).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The key part of the name is the stereochemical descriptors: **(3aR,7aS,E)**.\n    *   **Analysis:** These descriptors specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3a and 7a) and the geometry of a double bond (E). The designation of a specific enantiomer (using R/S notation) for a complex molecule that does not possess internal symmetry (it is not a meso compound) means the molecule is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A pure sample of a single enantiomer is always optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereocenters have opposite configurations (one R, one S). The substituents on C2 (H, CH₃, COOH) are identical to those on C3. Let's visualize the molecule. It's possible to find a conformation that possesses a center of inversion midway between the C2-C3 bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. This is a classic example of a **meso compound**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Meso compounds are achiral and thus optically inactive. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. The two stereocenters are C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereocenters have the same configuration (both R). This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a chiral molecule, a pure sample of the (2R,3R) enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the -CH₂-CH₂- path, and the -CH=CH- path. Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies a single enantiomer, the (R)-isomer. A molecule with a single stereocenter is chiral (unless it can racemize under ambient conditions, which is not the case here).\n    *   **Conclusion:** A pure sample of the (R) enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at C1, C3, and C5.\n    *   **Analysis:** This name is subtle. The lowercase `s` descriptor is the IUPAC designation for absolute configuration (equivalent to `S`), often used for pseudoasymmetric centers or in specific compound classes. The use of absolute configuration descriptors like `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that C1, C3, and C5 are true stereocenters. This can only happen if the molecule as a whole is chiral. The all-cis isomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is highly symmetric (it has a C₃ axis and three planes of symmetry) and is achiral; its C1, C3, C5 atoms are not stereocenters because the paths around the ring are identical. Therefore, the name must refer to a chiral diastereomer, specifically the one where two -OH groups are cis to each other and one is trans. This diastereomer is chiral, and the name specifies one of its two enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(C₅H₉).\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's search for stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH₂- group, and two identical methyl (-CH₃) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter. No other atom in the molecule is a stereocenter. The molecule also possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is achiral, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Optically inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. (3 compounds)\n- Optically active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. (4 compounds)\n\nThere are 4 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
