    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    The parallax of a star, `plx`, is inversely proportional to its distance, `d`, from the observer. The relationship is given by:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n    For simplicity, we assume `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **State the assumption.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number of stars per unit volume, which is the number density `ρ`, is constant throughout space.\n    `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in a thin spherical shell.**\n    Consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer (Sun).\n    *   Let the inner radius of the shell be `d`.\n    *   Let the thickness of the shell be `dd`.\n    The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = 4πd² dd`\n\n    The number of stars, `dN`, within this shell is the number density `ρ` multiplied by the volume `dV`:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n    Since `ρ` and `4π` are constants, we can write the proportionality:\n    `dN ∝ d² dd`\n\n4.  **Express the relationship in terms of parallax.**\n    We want to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on `plx`. To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   From step 1, we have `d = 1 / plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between the differentials `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1 / plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`. The negative sign just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. When we are counting the number of stars in a range, we are concerned with the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign:\n        `|dd| = (1 / plx²) d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Combine the expressions.**\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into the proportionality for `dN` from step 3:\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx)² * ( (1 / plx²) d(plx) )`\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx²) * (1 / plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN / d(plx)`. From the final proportionality in the previous step, we can see:\n    `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion.**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax varies as the inverse fourth power of the parallax. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
