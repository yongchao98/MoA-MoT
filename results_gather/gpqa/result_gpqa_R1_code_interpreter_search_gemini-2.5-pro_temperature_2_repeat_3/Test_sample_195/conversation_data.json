    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for the maximum speed of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Define the system and conserved quantity.**\n    The system consists of a mass $m$ attached to a spring with spring constant $k$. The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. This force is conservative, and the corresponding potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    In a relativistic system, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energy of the mass and the potential energy. Since there are no non-conservative forces, the total energy is conserved.\n    The total energy $E_{total}$ at any point $x$ with velocity $v$ is given by:\n    $E_{total} = E_{relativistic} + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Analyze the energy at the point of maximum amplitude.**\n    The maximum amplitude is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, denoted by $x = A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops before reversing its direction. Therefore, its velocity is zero ($v=0$).\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    Since total energy is conserved, this is the total energy of the oscillator throughout its motion.\n\n3.  **Analyze the energy at the equilibrium position.**\n    The equilibrium position is at $x=0$. At this point, the potential energy is zero ($U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$).\n    The restoring force is also zero at this point, which means the acceleration is zero. This is where the mass achieves its maximum speed, $v_{max}$.\n    The total energy at the equilibrium position is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n    where $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n4.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    Equate the total energy at the maximum amplitude ($x=A$) with the total energy at the equilibrium position ($x=0$):\n    Energy at $x=A$ = Energy at $x=0$\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.**\n    First, solve the energy equation for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to relate it to $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ we found:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we can first solve for the term $(1 - v_{max}^2/c^2)$:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$ by multiplying by $c^2$ and taking the square root:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The derived expression matches option C.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (Classical limit, incorrect)\n    *   B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ (Incorrect form)\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ (Correct)\n    *   D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ (Incorrect form and dimensions)\n\nThe correct expression for the maximum speed of the mass is given by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
