    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectroscopic data:**\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** Indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula options.\n    *   **Structure Core:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents. The base formula for the ring itself, after substitution, is C6H4, assuming the two substituents replace two hydrogen atoms. The 1H NMR data, showing two signals for aromatic hydrogens, strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern, which would have this C6H4 core.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR signals:** The spectrum shows six signals in total. Let's identify the groups responsible for these signals.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** This corresponds to the 4 protons on the di-substituted benzene ring (C6**H4**). A 1,4-disubstituted ring would give two signals for two protons each (typically two doublets), which fits this description.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates a C=C double bond outside the aromatic ring.\n        *   Signal 1: A doublet.\n        *   Signal 2: A doublet of quartets.\n        *   This specific splitting pattern (d and dq) is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton (giving a doublet). The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This group has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals belongs to the methyl group of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`) group we just identified. This methyl group's signal would be a doublet due to splitting by the adjacent vinyl proton.\n        *   The second –CH3 signal must belong to another part of the molecule. Since we know there's an ester, this is likely a methyl group attached to the ester, either as a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, it's a **CH3** group. This signal would appear as a singlet as it has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It confirms that there are no ethyl, propyl (other than propenyl), or other methylene-containing chains in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular structure and determine the formula:**\n    Let's assemble the pieces we have identified:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring core: **C6H4**\n    *   A propenyl substituent: **C3H5**\n    *   An ester group containing a methyl group. Let's analyze the two possibilities for the ester substituent:\n        *   Possibility A: A methyl ester group, `-COOCH3`. This has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n        *   Possibility B: An acetoxy group, `-OCOCH3`. This also has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n    Now, we sum the atoms from the core (C6H4) and the two substituents (the C3H5 group and the C2H3O2 group) to find the total molecular formula.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl of ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU formula is `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`.\n    For C11H12O2, DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    Let's check the DoU from the proposed structure:\n    *   1 for the benzene ring.\n    *   3 for the double bonds within the benzene ring.\n    *   1 for the vinyl C=C double bond.\n    *   1 for the ester C=O double bond.\n    *   Total DoU = 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    The DoU matches, confirming the formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D. The other options are incorrect:\n    *   C12H14O2 and C12H12O2 have the wrong carbon count.\n    *   C11H14O2 has too many hydrogens, which would mean a lower degree of unsaturation (DoU = 5), contradicting the presence of the aromatic ring, a vinyl group, and a carbonyl group.\n    *   Furthermore, any option with more than 12 hydrogens or containing a -CH2- unit would contradict the NMR data. For example, C11H14O2 would likely arise from reducing the C=C bond of the propenyl group to a C-C bond (propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3), but this would eliminate the vinyl signals and introduce two CH2 signals.\n\nTherefore, the only possible formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
