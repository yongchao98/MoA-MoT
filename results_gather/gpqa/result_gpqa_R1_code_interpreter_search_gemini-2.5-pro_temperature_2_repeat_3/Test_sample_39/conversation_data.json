    "This is a common colloquialism in a chemistry lab, particularly in organic chemistry where purification is a constant and often challenging task. Let's break down the meaning.\n\n1.  **The Context**: A synthetic organic chemist is talking about their \"compounds\". This typically means the desired product of their reaction along with other substances in the mixture, such as unreacted starting materials or undesired byproducts. The goal is to isolate the desired compound in a pure form.\n2.  **The Problem**: \"Not well - my compounds are on top of each other.\" This is a metaphorical statement describing a failure to separate these different compounds.\n3.  **Separation Techniques**: The primary method for purifying and separating compounds in a synthetic organic lab is **chromatography** (e.g., column chromatography or thin-layer chromatography, TLC).\n4.  **How Chromatography Works**: Chromatography separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents). This partitioning is governed primarily by the **polarity** of the compounds.\n5.  **The Metaphor**:\n    *   In **Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC)**, which is used to quickly analyze a reaction mixture, different compounds travel up a plate at different rates and appear as distinct spots. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at nearly the same rate, and their spots will overlap, literally appearing \"on top of each other\".\n    *   In **column chromatography**, compounds move down a column of stationary phase as distinct bands. If two compounds have similar polarities, their bands will not separate and will elute from the column at the same time, co-mingling in the collection flasks. The bands are, in effect, \"on top of each other\" within the column.\n\nTherefore, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is a direct reference to a failed separation via chromatography, which is a consequence of the compounds having very similar polarities.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   A) Similar boiling points would make separation by distillation difficult, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of a chromatographic separation.\n*   C) Similar optical rotations is a property of chiral molecules but is not a basis for standard separation techniques. Two compounds could have identical optical rotations and still be easily separable by chromatography if their polarities are different.\n*   D) Non-covalent interactions are the basis for physical properties like polarity and boiling point, but this answer is too general. The direct operational problem being described is the consequence of a specific physical property, not the underlying interaction itself. The chemist is complaining about a failed separation, which is directly linked to the similar polarities of the compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
