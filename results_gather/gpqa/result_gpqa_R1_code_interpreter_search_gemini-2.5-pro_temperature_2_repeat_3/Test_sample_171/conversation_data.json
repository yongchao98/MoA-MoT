    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Principle:** The problem deals with the excitation of atoms in the photospheres of stars. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to use the Boltzmann distribution to describe the population of atoms in different energy levels.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (level 1):\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n    where:\n    *   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the excited and lower states, respectively.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the two states.\n    *   E₂ - E₁ = ΔE is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define \"Excitation\":** The term \"excitation\" in this context refers to the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number in the ground state (or a lower reference state), which is N₂/N₁. Let's call this ratio `R`.\n    `R = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T)]`\n\n4.  **Apply to Both Stars:** We have two stars, star_1 with temperature T₁ and star_2 with temperature T₂. We can write the excitation ratio for each star:\n    *   For star_1: `R₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]`\n    *   For star_2: `R₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]`\n    The term (g₂/g₁) is a property of the iron atom's energy levels and is the same for both stars.\n\n5.  **Use the Given Information:** The problem states that star_1 is \"twice as excited\" as star_2. This translates to the mathematical relationship:\n    `R₁ = 2 * R₂`\n\n6.  **Set Up the Equation:** Substitute the expressions for R₁ and R₂ into this relationship:\n    `(g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * [(g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]]`\n\n7.  **Simplify the Equation:** The statistical weight term (g₂/g₁) appears on both sides and can be canceled out:\n    `exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]`\n\n8.  **Solve for T₁ and T₂:** To solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    `ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)])`\n    Using the logarithm property ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b):\n    `-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)])`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)`\n\n9.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the terms to solve for ln(2):\n    `ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)`\n    Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)`\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\n10. **Incorporate the Numerical Values:** The problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. The problem is intentionally designed so that the ratio (ΔE / k) simplifies:\n    `(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n    Substituting this value back into our equation:\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n    `ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\n11. **Compare with Options:** This final expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
