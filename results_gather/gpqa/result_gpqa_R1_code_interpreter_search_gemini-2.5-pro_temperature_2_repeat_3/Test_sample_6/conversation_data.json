    "This problem requires us to find the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray (γ₁) that can interact with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon (γ₂) to produce an electron-positron pair (e⁻e⁺). The reaction is γ₁ + γ₂ → e⁻ + e⁺.\n\n1.  **Principle of Relativity and Four-Momentum Conservation:**\n    The core principle to solve this problem is the conservation of four-momentum. The total four-momentum of the system before the collision must equal the total four-momentum after the collision. The four-momentum is a vector P = (E/c, **p**), where E is energy and **p** is the three-dimensional momentum. The square of the four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial reference frames: P² = E²/c² - |**p**|² = (m₀c)², where m₀ is the rest mass.\n\n2.  **Setting up the Equation:**\n    Let P₁, P₂, P₃, and P₄ be the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray, the CMB photon, the electron, and the positron, respectively.\n    Conservation of four-momentum states: P₁ + P₂ = P₃ + P₄.\n\n    To eliminate the momentum vectors, we can square both sides of the equation:\n    (P₁ + P₂)² = (P₃ + P₄)²\n    P₁² + P₂² + 2(P₁ ⋅ P₂) = (P₃ + P₄)²\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Terms at Threshold:**\n    *   **P₁² and P₂²:** Photons have zero rest mass, so for any photon, P² = 0. Therefore, P₁² = 0 and P₂² = 0.\n    *   **P₁ ⋅ P₂:** This is the dot product of the two initial four-momenta. P₁ ⋅ P₂ = E₁E₂/c² - **p₁** ⋅ **p₂**. Since for a photon |**p**| = E/c, this becomes P₁ ⋅ P₂ = (E₁E₂ - E₁E₂cosθ)/c², where θ is the angle between the two incoming photons.\n    *   **(P₃ + P₄)²:** This is the square of the total four-momentum of the final electron-positron system. This quantity is a Lorentz invariant. We can evaluate it in the center-of-mass frame. The threshold energy is the minimum energy required to create the particles, which means the electron and positron are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame. In this frame, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the electron and positron (E_cm = m_e c² + m_e c² = 2m_e c²), and the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the square of the final four-momentum is ((2m_e c²)²/c²) - 0 = (2m_e c)².\n\n4.  **Solving for the Threshold Energy (E₁):**\n    Substituting these terms back into our equation (and working in natural units where c=1 for simplicity, reintroducing it later if needed):\n    2(E₁E₂(1 - cosθ)) = (2m_e c²)²\n\n    To find the minimum possible energy E₁ for the reaction to occur, we need to consider the most efficient collision scenario. This happens when the term (1 - cosθ) is maximized. The maximum value is 2, which occurs for a head-on collision where the photons travel in opposite directions (θ = 180° or π radians, so cosθ = -1).\n\n    The equation for the threshold energy becomes:\n    2(E₁(1 - (-1))) = (2m_e c²)²\n    4 E₁E₂ = 4(m_e c²)²\n    E₁E₂ = (m_e c²)²\n\n    Solving for E₁:\n    E₁ = (m_e c²)² / E₂\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    We need the following values:\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron (m_e c²): approximately 0.511 MeV = 5.11 x 10⁵ eV.\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon (E₂): given as 10⁻³ eV.\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula allows us to calculate the required gamma-ray energy.\n\n```python\n# Constants\n# Electron rest mass energy in eV\nm_e_c2_eV = 5.1099895e5\n# Average energy of a CMB photon in eV\nE_cmb_eV = 1e-3\n\n# Calculate the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray in eV\n# Formula: E_gamma = (m_e_c2**2) / E_cmb\nE_gamma_eV = (m_e_c2_eV**2) / E_cmb_eV\n\n# Convert the energy from eV to GeV (1 GeV = 1e9 eV)\nE_gamma_GeV = E_gamma_eV / 1e9\n\nprint(f\"{E_gamma_GeV:.2e}\")\n```\n\nThis calculation will provide the numerical answer for the gamma-ray energy in GeV, which can then be compared with the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>",

The reaction is γ₁ + γ₂ → e⁺ + e⁻.\n\n**1. Conservation of Four-Momentum**\nThe fundamental principle governing this interaction is the conservation of relativistic four-momentum. The total four-momentum before the collision must equal the total four-momentum after the collision. Let P₁, P₂, P₃, and P₄ be the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray, the CMB photon, the electron, and the positron, respectively.\nP₁ + P₂ = P₃ + P₄\n\n**2. Lorentz Invariance**\nTo solve for the energy, we use the fact that the square of the total four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames. We can square both sides of the conservation equation:\n(P₁ + P₂)² = (P₃ + P₄)²\n\n**3. Expanding the Equation**\nLet's expand the terms:\nP₁² + P₂² + 2(P₁ ⋅ P₂) = (P₃ + P₄)²\n\n*   **Left Side:** Photons are massless particles, so the square of their four-momentum is zero (P² = (mc²)² = 0 for m=0). Therefore, P₁² = 0 and P₂² = 0.\n    The left side simplifies to 2(P₁ ⋅ P₂). The dot product of the two four-momenta is P₁ ⋅ P₂ = E₁E₂/c² - **p₁** ⋅ **p₂**. Since for a photon |**p**| = E/c, this becomes P₁ ⋅ P₂ = (E₁E₂ - E₁E₂cosθ)/c², where θ is the angle between the direction of the two photons. So, the left side of the equation is 2E₁E₂(1 - cosθ)/c².\n\n*   **Right Side:** The term (P₃ + P₄)² is the squared invariant mass of the final electron-positron system. This is easiest to evaluate in the center-of-mass frame. The threshold energy is the minimum energy required to create the particles, which means the electron and positron are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame. In this frame, the total energy is the sum of their rest energies, E_cm = mₑc² + mₑc² = 2mₑc², and the total momentum is zero.\n    Thus, (P₃ + P₄)² = (E_cm/c)² - **p**² = (2mₑc²)²/c² = 4(mₑc²)².\n\n**4. Finding the Threshold Energy**\nCombining both sides, we get:\n2E₁E₂(1 - cosθ)/c² = 4(mₑc²)²\nE₁E₂(1 - cosθ) = 2(mₑc²)²\n\nTo find the minimum energy E₁ required for this reaction to happen, we must consider the most favorable condition for the interaction. This occurs when the term (1 - cosθ) is at its maximum value. The maximum occurs when the two photons collide head-on, meaning they travel in opposite directions (θ = 180° or π radians), which gives cosθ = -1.\nSubstituting cosθ = -1 into the equation:\nE₁E₂(1 - (-1)) = 2(mₑc²)²\n2E₁E₂ = 2(mₑc²)²\nE₁E₂ = (mₑc²)²\n\nSolving for the high-energy photon's energy, E₁:\nE₁ = (mₑc²)² / E₂\n\n**5. Calculation**\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Rest mass energy of an electron, mₑc² ≈ 0.511 MeV = 5.11 × 10⁵ eV\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, E₂ = 10⁻³ eV\n\nNow, we plug these values into the equation:\nE₁ = (5.11 × 10⁵ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)\nE₁ = (2.611 × 10¹¹ eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)\nE₁ = 2.611 × 10¹⁴ eV\n\nFinally, we convert this energy to GeV (1 GeV = 10⁹ eV):\nE₁ = (2.611 × 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)\nE₁ ≈ 2.61 × 10⁵ GeV\n\nThis value corresponds to option C. The calculation performed by the code `2.61e+05` GeV confirms this result.\n\n<<<C>>>"
