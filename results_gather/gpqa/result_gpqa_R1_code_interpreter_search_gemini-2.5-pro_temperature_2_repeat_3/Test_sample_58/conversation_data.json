    "Here is a breakdown of the thinking process to solve this chemical equilibrium problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the components:** The solution is a mixture of a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2).\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:**\n    *   **CH3COOH (Weak Acid):**\n        *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n        *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n    *   **HCl (Strong Acid):**\n        *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n        *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n        *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-. Thus, moles of H+ from HCl = 0.080 mol.\n\n    *   **Ba(OH)2 (Strong Base):**\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n        *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n        *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates into one Ba2+ ion and two OH- ions (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-).\n        *   Therefore, moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n3.  **Determine the net reaction:** When acids and bases are mixed, they neutralize each other. The reaction proceeds in order of strength. The strong acid will react with the strong base first.\n\n    *   **Step 1: Reaction between Strong Acid and Strong Base**\n        *   Reactants: H+ (from HCl) and OH- (from Ba(OH)2)\n        *   Moles H+ = 0.080 mol\n        *   Moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n        *   The reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O\n        *   Since there are fewer moles of H+, it is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n        *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Reaction between Remaining Strong Base and Weak Acid**\n        *   Reactants: Remaining OH- and CH3COOH\n        *   Moles OH- = 0.100 mol\n        *   Moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n        *   The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n        *   Now, CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n        *   Moles of OH- remaining after this reaction = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final concentration of the excess species:**\n    *   The final solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of OH- ions, which come from a strong base. This excess OH- will determine the pH of the solution.\n    *   First, calculate the total volume of the final mixture:\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L.\n    *   Next, calculate the concentration of the excess OH- ions:\n        *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M.\n\n5.  **Calculate the pH of the solution:**\n    *   First, calculate the pOH from the [OH-]:\n        *   pOH = -log10([OH-]) = -log10(0.04167)\n    *   Then, use the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C) to find the pH:\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH\n\nTo get the precise numerical value, we use a calculator.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid)\nmoles_h_plus = 0.400 * 0.2\n\n# Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid)\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.500 * 0.1\n\n# Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base)\nmoles_oh_minus = 0.300 * 0.3 * 2\n\n# Total moles of acid reacting with the strong base\ntotal_moles_acid = moles_h_plus + moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Calculate the moles of excess OH- after neutralizing all acids\nexcess_moles_oh = moles_oh_minus - total_moles_acid\n\n# Calculate the total volume of the solution in Liters\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\n\n# Calculate the final concentration of OH-\nfinal_oh_concentration = excess_moles_oh / total_volume\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(final_oh_concentration)\n\n# Calculate pH\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH:.2f}\")\n```\n12.62\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Identify the reactants and their nature:**\n*   CH3COOH: A weak acid.\n*   HCl: A strong acid. It completely dissociates into H⁺ and Cl⁻ ions.\n*   Ba(OH)₂: A strong base. It completely dissociates into one Ba²⁺ ion and two OH⁻ ions.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial moles of acidic and basic species:**\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (Weak Acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (Strong Acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol H⁺**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (Strong Base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 M × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol OH⁻**\n\n**3. Determine the neutralization reaction:**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acid, starting with the strong acid (HCl) first, followed by the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Total moles of acid available for neutralization:**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles of H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles of CH₃COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   **Compare total moles of acid and base:**\n    *   Total Acid = 0.130 mol\n    *   Total Base (OH⁻) = 0.180 mol\n    *   Since there are more moles of base than acid, the final solution will be basic.\n\n**4. Calculate the moles of excess base:**\n*   **Moles of excess OH⁻:**\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = Initial moles OH⁻ - Total moles acid\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**5. Calculate the concentration of the excess base in the final solution:**\n*   **Total Volume of the mixture:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**6. Calculate the pH:**\n*   First, calculate the pOH from the concentration of OH⁻.\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   Then, use the relationship pH + pOH = 14 to find the pH.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ **12.62**\n\nThis entire calculation can be confirmed with a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial moles\n# Moles of H+ from strong acid HCl\nmoles_h_plus = 0.400 * 0.2\n\n# Moles of weak acid CH3COOH\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.500 * 0.1\n\n# Moles of OH- from strong base Ba(OH)2. Note the stoichiometry (2 OH- per Ba(OH)2)\nmoles_oh_minus = 0.300 * 0.3 * 2\n\n# Step 3 & 4: Determine excess species\n# Total moles of acidic species to be neutralized by the strong base\ntotal_moles_acid_to_neutralize = moles_h_plus + moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Calculate moles of excess OH- after neutralizing all acids\nexcess_moles_oh = moles_oh_minus - total_moles_acid_to_neutralize\n\n# Step 5: Calculate final concentration\n# Calculate the total volume of the solution in Liters\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\n\n# The pH is determined by the excess strong base.\n# Calculate the final concentration of excess OH-\nfinal_oh_concentration = excess_moles_oh / total_volume\n\n# Step 6: Calculate pH\n# Calculate pOH from the OH- concentration\npOH = -math.log10(final_oh_concentration)\n\n# Calculate pH using the relation pH + pOH = 14\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
