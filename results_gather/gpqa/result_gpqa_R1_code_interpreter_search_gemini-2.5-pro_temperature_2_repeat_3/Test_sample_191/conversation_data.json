    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the effect of the charge inside the cavity:**\n    The point charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the conductor. Due to electrostatic induction, this charge will attract negative charges and repel positive charges within the mobile charge sea of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge induction on the surfaces:**\n    *   **Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):** To cancel the electric field produced by the point charge `+q` inside the bulk of the conductor (a necessary condition for electrostatic equilibrium), a total charge of `-q` gets induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this `-q` charge on the inner wall will not be uniform; it will be denser on the parts of the wall closer to the `+q` charge.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):**\n    A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields the exterior region from the electrostatic effects of any charges placed inside it. The electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero. This implies that the combined electric field from the point charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface must be zero everywhere outside the cavity, including within the conductor material and in the region outside the conductor.\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the conductor is solely due to the charge `+q` residing on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:**\n    The `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself to make the surface an equipotential. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over the outer surface. The non-uniform arrangement of the charge `+q` and the cavity inside does not affect the charge distribution on the outer surface due to the shielding effect of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    The electric field at an external point P due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field produced by a point charge equal to the total charge on the shell, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The distances `r` (cavity radius), `s` (cavity offset), `l` (distance from P to cavity center), and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are included as distractors. The only parameters that matter are the net charge that appears on the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor to the point of measurement (`L`).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
