    "This problem can be solved using the energy-time formulation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that for a quantum state, the uncertainty in its energy ($\\Delta E$) and its lifetime ($\\Delta t$) are related by the inequality $\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\hbar/2$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. A simplified and commonly used form for calculating the energy width is $\\Delta E \\approx \\hbar / \\Delta t$.\n\n*   **Energy Width:** A quantum state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly defined energy. Instead, its energy is \"smeared\" or \"broadened\" over a range $\\Delta E$. This $\\Delta E$ is often called the natural linewidth or energy width of the state. The shorter the lifetime, the larger the energy uncertainty (the broader the energy level).\n\n*   **Calculating Energy Widths:** We are given the lifetimes ($\\tau$) for two states, which we can use as our $\\Delta t$. We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units that are convenient for this problem, which is eV·s.\n    *   $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s.\n    *   State 1: $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s.\n    *   State 2: $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s.\n\n    Now, we calculate the energy width for each state:\n    *   $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\hbar / \\tau_1 = (6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}) / (10^{-9} \\text{ s}) = 6.582 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\hbar / \\tau_2 = (6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}) / (10^{-8} \\text{ s}) = 6.582 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV.\n\n*   **Resolution Condition:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference between their central energies, $|E_1 - E_2|$, must be large enough to overcome their combined energy widths. A standard criterion is that the separation must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths (specifically, the half-width at half-maximum, which is what our $\\Delta E$ calculation represents).\n\n*   **Required Energy Difference:** The minimum required energy difference is the sum of the widths:\n    *   $|E_1 - E_2| > \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$\n    *   $|E_1 - E_2| > (6.582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}) + (6.582 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ eV})$\n    *   $|E_1 - E_2| > 7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n*   **Comparing with Options:** We must now find which of the given options satisfies this condition.\n    *   A) $10^{-4}$ eV is much greater than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   B) $10^{-8}$ eV is less than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   C) $10^{-9}$ eV is less than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   D) $10^{-11}$ eV is less than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy separation large enough for the two levels to be resolved.\n\n**2. Python Code for Calculation**\nThe following Python script automates the calculation to verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Physical constant\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Given lifetimes of the two quantum states\nlifetime1 = 1e-9   # seconds for state 1\nlifetime2 = 1e-8   # seconds for state 2\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state using the uncertainty principle\n# Delta_E is approximately hbar / Delta_t (lifetime)\nenergy_width1 = hbar_eVs / lifetime1\nenergy_width2 = hbar_eVs / lifetime2\n\n# To clearly resolve the two states, the energy difference between them must be\n# at least on the order of the sum of their individual energy widths.\nmin_required_separation = energy_width1 + energy_width2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {energy_width1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {energy_width2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required minimum energy difference for resolution (ΔE1 + ΔE2): {min_required_separation:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Given options for the energy difference\noption_A = 1e-4\noption_B = 1e-8\noption_C = 1e-9\noption_D = 1e-11\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Comparing options with the required minimum separation ---\")\nprint(f\"Option A (1e-4 eV): Resolvable? {option_A > min_required_separation}\")\nprint(f\"Option B (1e-8 eV): Resolvable? {option_B > min_required_separation}\")\nprint(f\"Option C (1e-9 eV): Resolvable? {option_C > min_required_separation}\")\nprint(f\"Option D (1e-11 eV): Resolvable? {option_D > min_required_separation}\")\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nEnergy width of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\nRequired minimum energy difference for resolution (ΔE1 + ΔE2): 7.240e-07 eV\n\n--- Comparing options with the required minimum separation ---\nOption A (1e-4 eV): Resolvable?

    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths).
