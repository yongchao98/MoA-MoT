    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **Part 1: Initial Dilution**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm3\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm3\n*   Final volume of the solution (V2) = 20.00 cm3 + 20.00 cm3 = 40.00 cm3\n\nWe use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2 to find the new concentration (M2):\n\n*   M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2\n*   M2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm3) / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm3 of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### **Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nThis point is in the buffer region of the titration, where we have a mixture of unreacted acetic acid (HA) and its conjugate base, acetate (A-), formed from the reaction with NaOH. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio of [A⁻] to [HA]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base (acetate), and 75% remains as acetic acid.\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is therefore 25/75 = 1/3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.256\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n### **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate. The solution now contains only the weak base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions.\n\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid:**\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 / 1000) L = 0.001 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:**\n    *   Moles of acid = Moles of base\n    *   0.001 mol = Concentration_NaOH × Volume_NaOH\n    *   Volume_NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n3.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of OH⁻ from hydrolysis:**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   For the hydrolysis reaction, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]. Let x = [OH⁻].\n    *   Kb ≈ x² / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   x² = Kb × [CH₃COO⁻] = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × (0.02 M) = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n5.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nLet's run a single python script to confirm both calculations precisely.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants and Initial Values ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nconc_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nvol_acid_initial = 0.020  # L\nvol_water_added = 0.020 # L\nconc_naoh = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Part 1: Dilution ---\nvol_acid_diluted = vol_acid_initial + vol_water_added\nconc_acid_diluted = (conc_acid_initial * vol_acid_initial) / vol_acid_diluted\n# print(f\"Diluted Acid Concentration: {conc_acid_diluted:.3f} M\") # 0.025 M\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Part 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Moles of acid to be titrated\nmoles_acid = conc_acid_diluted * vol_acid_diluted\n\n# Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point\nvol_naoh_eq = moles_acid / conc_naoh\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nvol_total_eq = vol_acid_diluted + vol_naoh_eq\n\n# Concentration of acetate (A-) at equivalence point\nmoles_acetate = moles_acid\nconc_acetate_eq = moles_acetate / vol_total_eq\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nconc_oh = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate_eq)\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_oh)\npH_eq = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the pH at the specified points during the titration, we will perform the calculations in three main steps:\n1.  Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after the initial dilution.\n2.  Calculate the pH at 25% titration using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n3.  Calculate the pH at the equivalence point by considering the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.\n\n**Step 1: Concentration After Dilution**\nFirst, we find the new concentration of the acetic acid solution after it's diluted with water. We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, where:\n*   M₁ = Initial concentration = 0.05 M\n*   V₁ = Initial volume = 20.00 cm³\n*   V₂ = Final volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   M₂ = Final concentration\n\nM₂ = (M₁ × V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the titration begins with 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\nAt any point before the equivalence point, the solution is a buffer containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), formed by the reaction with NaOH. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH])\n\n1.  **Find pKa**:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio of conjugate base to acid**:\n    At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and the remaining 75% is still acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    The ratio [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1 / 3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH**:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.26\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO). The solution consists of the weak base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which hydrolyzes in water to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\n1.  **Calculate moles of acid and volume of base**:\n    *   Moles of acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 / 1000) L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of base added = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentration of acetate at the equivalence point**:\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   The moles of acetate formed equals the initial moles of acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\n3.  **Calculate the [OH⁻] from hydrolysis**:\n    *   First, we need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴.\n    *   Kb = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression for hydrolysis: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH]. The equation becomes Kb ≈ x² / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   x² = Kb × [CH₃COO⁻] = (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × (0.02 M) = 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹.\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate pOH and then pH**:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52.\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of 4.26 at 25% titration and a pH of 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
