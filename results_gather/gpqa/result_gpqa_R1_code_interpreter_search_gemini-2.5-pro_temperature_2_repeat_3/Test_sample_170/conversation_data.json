    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring determines where the new bromine atom will attach (the regioselectivity) and how fast the reaction will be (the reactivity).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive towards electrophiles. They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. Examples are alkyl groups (-CH3, -C2H5).\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These are halogens (-Cl). They withdraw electron density through induction (deactivating the ring) but donate electron density through resonance, which stabilizes the intermediate for ortho and para attack.\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Examples are -NO2, -COOH, -COOC2H5.\n\nThe question asks to order the substances by the increasing yield of the **para-isomer**.\n\n**2. Classify the Substances**\n\nFirst, we classify the given substances based on their substituent's directing effect:\n\n*   **Substances that will give a high yield of para-isomer (ortho-, para-directors):**\n    1)  C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n    3)  C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    5)  C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n*   **Substances that will give a very low yield of para-isomer (meta-directors):**\n    2)  C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    4)  C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    6)  C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\nThis means the overall order will be (meta-directors) < (ortho-, para-directors).\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the vast majority of the product is the meta-isomer. The small amounts of ortho and para isomers formed are inversely related to the electron-withdrawing (deactivating) strength of the substituent. The stronger the deactivating group, the lower the yield of ortho and para products.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n*   **-NO2 (4)** is the strongest deactivator, so it will produce the least amount of para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6)** is a strong deactivator, but less so than -NO2. It will produce a very small amount of para-isomer (for nitration, ~2%).\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)** is the weakest deactivator in this group. It will produce a small amount of para-isomer, but more than the other two (for nitration, ~6%).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**4. Order the Ortho-, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor ortho-, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is significant. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by two main factors:\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** The specific electronic nature of the group influences the relative stability of the intermediates for ortho and para attack.\n\nLet's compare them:\n*   **C6H5-CH3 (1, Toluene):** The methyl group is small. Bromination gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products. Literature values for bromination show approximately **67% para-isomer**.\n*   **C6H5-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is larger (bulkier) than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. Literature values indicate approximately **90-94% para-isomer**.\n*   **C6H5-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** The chlorine atom is a deactivating o,p-director. The strong inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the ortho positions more significantly than the para position, leading to high para-selectivity. Literature values for bromination show approximately **87% para-isomer**.\n\nBased on these values, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\nToluene (67%) < Chlorobenzene (87%) < Ethylbenzene (90-94%)\nSo, the order is **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**5. Combine the Orders**\n\nNow we combine the two groups. The meta-directors all have a much lower para-yield than the ortho-, para-directors.\n\nCombined order: (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)\nFinal order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**6. Compare with Provided Options**\n\nLet's examine the given choices:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nOur derived order (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5) does not perfectly match any of the options. This suggests a possible error in the question's options or a reliance on slightly different data.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options to find the best fit.\n*   **Option C: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n    *   The order for the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) is correct.\n    *   The order for the ortho-, para-directors is given as 1 < 5 < 3. This means Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. This contradicts our data showing Chlorobenzene (87%) < Ethylbenzene (~90%).\n\n*   **Option D: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**\n    *   The order for the meta-directors (4 < 2 < 6) is incorrect. The para yield for COOH (6) is lower than for COOC2H5 (2).\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for the meta-directors and the resulting para-yield is a very standard and reliable principle in organic chemistry. Option C is the only one that correctly orders this part (4 < 6 < 2). The relative ordering of the ortho-, para-directors can be subject to subtle effects and varying literature data, although the order 1 < 3 < 5 seems more supported. Given the choices, Option C is the most plausible answer as it correctly identifies the two main classes and correctly orders the members of the meta-directing class. The discrepancy is likely due to the specific data source used for the question.\n\nTherefore, we select the option that is most consistent with fundamental chemical principles.\n\n<<<C>>>"
