    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Determine the Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nIn natural units (where `ħ = c = 1`), the action `S` is a dimensionless quantity. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over four-dimensional spacetime:\nS = ∫ d⁴x L\n\nThe dimension of the four-volume element `d⁴x` is `[d⁴x] = [length]⁴`. Since mass and length are inversely related in natural units (`[length] = M⁻¹`), the dimension of `d⁴x` is `M⁻⁴`.\n\nFor the action `S` to be dimensionless (`[S] = M⁰`), the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of `[L] = M⁴`. This applies to any term within the Lagrangian, including the interaction term `L_int`.\nTherefore, `[L_int] = M⁴`.\n\n### **2. Determine the Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\nTo find the dimension of the coupling constant `κ`, we first need the dimensions of the fields `ψ` and `F^{μν}`. We can deduce these from their respective kinetic terms in the standard QED Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Fermion Field (`ψ`)**: The kinetic term for a fermion is `L_fermion = iψ̄γ^μ∂_μψ`.\n    *   We know `[L_fermion] = M⁴`.\n    *   The derivative operator `∂_μ = ∂/∂x^μ` has the dimension of inverse length, so `[∂_μ] = M¹`.\n    *   The gamma matrices `γ^μ` are dimensionless.\n    *   The dimensions of `ψ` and `ψ̄` are the same: `[ψ] = [ψ̄]`.\n    *   From the kinetic term, we have the dimensional equation: `M⁴ = [ψ̄][∂_μ][ψ] = [ψ]²M¹`.\n    *   Solving for `[ψ]`, we get `[ψ]² = M³`, which gives `[ψ] = M^(3/2)`.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor (`F^{μν}`)**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_gauge = -1/4 F_{μν}F^{μν}`.\n    *   We know `[L_gauge] = M⁴`.\n    *   From this term, we have the dimensional equation: `M⁴ = [F^{μν}]²`.\n    *   Solving for `[F^{μν}]`, we get `[F^{μν}] = M²`.\n\n### **3. Determine the Mass Dimension of `κ`**\n\nNow we can analyze the interaction term given: `L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}`.\n\n*   We need the dimension of this term to be `M⁴`.\n    `[L_int] = M⁴`.\n*   The term `σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]` is a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, so it is also dimensionless: `[σ_{μν}] = M⁰`.\n*   We can now write the full dimensional equation for the interaction term:\n    `[L_int] = [κ] [ψ̄] [σ_{μν}] [ψ] [F^{μν}]`\n*   Substituting the dimensions we found:\n    `M⁴ = [κ] * M^(3/2) * M⁰ * M^(3/2) * M²`\n*   Combine the powers of `M`:\n    `M⁴ = [κ] * M^(3/2 + 3/2 + 2) = [κ] * M^(3 + 2) = [κ] * M⁵`\n*   To solve for `[κ]`, we divide both sides by `M⁵`:\n    `[κ] = M⁴ / M⁵ = M⁻¹`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of `κ` is -1.\n\n### **4. Determine if the Theory is Renormalizable**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by \"power counting\", which involves looking at the mass dimension of the coupling constants in the Lagrangian.\n\n*   If a coupling constant `g` has a mass dimension `[g] > 0`, the interaction is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant `g` has a mass dimension `[g] = 0`, the interaction is **renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant `g` has a mass dimension `[g] < 0`, the interaction is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant is `κ` and its mass dimension is `[κ] = M⁻¹`. Since the mass dimension is negative, the theory is **non-renormalizable**. Such terms with negative mass dimension couplings are called higher-dimension operators and are characteristic of effective field theories, which are only valid up to a certain energy scale.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of `κ` is `[κ]_M = -1`.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
