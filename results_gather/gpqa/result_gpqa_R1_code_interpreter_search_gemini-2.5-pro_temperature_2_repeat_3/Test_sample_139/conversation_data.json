    "This is a chemical puzzle that requires identifying a substance, X, based on a series of described reactions and properties.\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues to identify substance B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). The melting point of water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is a very strong indicator that substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n\n2.  **Relate B back to X:** Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Since D₂O (heavy water) is produced later in the reaction sequence, the heavier isotope is Deuterium (D, or ²H). This means substance X must be a deuterated compound.\n\n3.  **Analyze the reaction of X with Y:**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, producing gas W and precipitate G.\n    *   Gas W's molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's test possible hydrogen gases:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Incorrect)\n        *   HD: 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Incorrect)\n        *   D₂: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Correct)\n    *   So, Gas W is Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   For D₂ gas to be produced, the deuterated substance X must react with another deuterated substance. Since D₂O (heavy water, B) is a product of heating G, and it's a stable liquid, it is highly likely that liquid Y is also heavy water, D₂O.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The prompt states that X and its close analog are common reagents in organic chemistry. Deuterated reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄) are common. Their analogs are LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that X = LiAlD₄ and Y = D₂O. The reaction is:\n        LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n    *   This reaction is famously violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W), which matches our finding.\n    *   It produces a precipitate, Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). This matches the clue.\n    *   The prompt says heating G releases B. When Al(OD)₃ is heated, it decomposes:\n        2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O\n    *   This releases D₂O (B), matching the clue.\n    *   Let's check the alternative, X = NaBD₄. The reaction with water (or heavy water) is much less violent than that of LiAlD₄. Furthermore, the reaction produces soluble sodium borate species, not a precipitate. Therefore, NaBD₄ is not substance X.\n\n5.  **Confirm with the final clue:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketone and carboxylic acid groups. A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) would be reduced to a diol (a molecule with two -OH or -OD groups), which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This is consistent.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final value:**\n    *   Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium.\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes.\n    *   Mass of the Deuterium isotope (²H) = 2.\n    *   Mass of the stable Aluminium isotope (²⁷Al) = 27.\n    *   There are 4 atoms of Deuterium in LiAlD₄.\n    *   There is 1 atom of Aluminium in LiAlD₄.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Number of D atoms × Mass of D) + (Number of Al atoms × Mass of Al)\n    *   Cumulative mass = (4 × 2) + (1 × 27) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n```python\n# Identify the elements and their counts in Substance X (LiAlD4)\n# Lightest element: Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D)\n# Heaviest element: Aluminium (Al)\n\n# Mass number of the Deuterium isotope (2H)\nmass_deuterium = 2\n# Number of Deuterium atoms in LiAlD4\ncount_deuterium = 4\n\n# Mass number of the stable Aluminium isotope (27Al)\nmass_aluminium = 27\n# Number of Aluminium atoms in LiAlD4\ncount_aluminium = 1\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass of all atoms of the lightest element\ntotal_mass_lightest = count_deuterium * mass_deuterium\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass of all atoms of the heaviest element\ntotal_mass_heaviest = count_aluminium * mass_aluminium\n\n# Calculate the final sum\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_lightest + total_mass_heaviest\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user has provided a chemical puzzle and wants me to solve it and find a specific calculated value.\n\nHere is my thinking process:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance B's melting point.**\n        *   \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15. So, 277 K is approximately 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of regular water (H₂O) is 0 °C. The melting point of heavy water (deuterium oxide, D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an extremely close match.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Substance **B is D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance X and its properties.**\n        *   \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"\n        *   Since we've identified D₂O as a product, the heavier isotope is Deuterium (D, or ²H), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Substance **X is a deuterated compound**.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: The reaction of X and Y.**\n        *   \"X reacts violently with liquid Y...\"\n        *   \"...with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"\n        *   Let's analyze possible gases formed from a deuterated compound. The most likely gas is some form of hydrogen gas.\n            *   H₂ (Protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Incorrect)\n            *   D₂ (Deuterium): A molecule has 2 deuterium atoms. Each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.

(Incorrect)\n        *   **Conclusion:** Gas **W is D₂**.\n        *   The reaction produces D₂ gas and eventually D₂O. This suggests that the source of deuterium is not just X, but also Y.

This is characteristic of a metal hydroxide, or in this case, a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)n. Heating it would produce a metal oxide and D₂O.\n        *   `2 M(OD)n → M₂On + n D₂O` (general form)\n\n    *   **Clue 5: Identity of X.**\n        *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n        *   We need a deuterated compound that reacts violently with heavy water to produce deuterium gas and a metal deuteroxide precipitate. Common reagents in organic chemistry that fit this profile (in their non-deuterated form) are strong reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n        *   Let's test the deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, LiAlD₄**.\n            *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common and powerful reducing agent.\n            *   The reaction with D₂O would be: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4 D₂↑`\n            *   This reaction is violent. ✓\n            *   It produces D₂ gas (W). ✓\n            *   It forms a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). ✓\n            *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) causes decomposition: `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B)`. This matches perfectly. ✓\n        *   Therefore, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: Confirmation with the keto acid reaction.**\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has both a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both groups to alcohols (or in this case, deuterated alcohols, -OD).\n        *   `R-C(=O)-COOH --(1.

    "Based on the detailed analysis of the chemical properties and reactions described, we can deduce the identities of the substances involved.\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B:** The melting point of Substance B is given as \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C. This temperature is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W:** The problem states that Gas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". The reaction involves a deuterated compound (implied by the presence of D₂O). Let's examine possible hydrogen-based gases:\n    *   H₂: Contains 2 protons (1 from each H) and 0 neutrons. Does not match.\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Contains 2 protons (1 from each D) and 2 neutrons (1 from each D). This matches the description.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance Y:** Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce D₂. For D₂ to be produced, the reaction likely involves two sources of deuterium. Since Substance X is a deuterated compound and B is D₂O, the most plausible identity for the liquid reactant Y is also **heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n4.  **Identification of Substance X:** We are looking for a deuterated compound that is a common organic reagent, reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas, and forms a precipitate (G). Let's test Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), the deuterated analog of the common reducing agent LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑`\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (Substance G).\n    *   When heated, the precipitate G decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases substance B (D₂O).\n    *   The final clue states that the reaction of a keto acid with X produces a molecule with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid into alcohol groups, resulting in a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as 4 atoms of Deuterium, D).\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminium (present as 1 atom of Al).\n    *   We use the mass numbers for the specific isotopes: D has a mass number of 2; the common isotope of Al has a mass number of 27.\n    *   Mass of all lightest element atoms = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all heaviest element atoms = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative atomic mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
