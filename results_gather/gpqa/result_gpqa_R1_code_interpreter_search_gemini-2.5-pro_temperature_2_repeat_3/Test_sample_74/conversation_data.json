    "This question requires a molecular biology analysis of a given DNA sequence to identify the reason for a failed protein expression experiment.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal is to express a fusion protein in mammalian cells (CHO). The protein consists of an N-terminal HA tag followed by the mouse GADD45G protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Provided DNA Sequence:** The sequence is the 'plus strand', which is the coding strand. It should contain an open reading frame (ORF) that codes for the fusion protein. The ribosome translates the mRNA (which will have the same sequence as the coding strand, but with U instead of T) starting from the ATG start codon.\n\n3.  **Break Down the Sequence into Codons:** We need to read the DNA sequence in groups of three (codons) starting from the beginning.\n    *   The sequence begins with `ATG`. This is the universal start codon, coding for Methionine (Met). Translation will initiate here.\n    *   The sequence continues with `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`. Let's translate this part, which should code for the HA tag (amino acid sequence: YPYDVPDYA).\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic acid (D)\n        *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic acid (D)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    *   The translated sequence so far is M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A. This correctly corresponds to the initiator Methionine followed by the HA tag. So, the tag sequence itself is correctly translated.\n\n4.  **Examine the Sequence Immediately Following the HA Tag:** After the HA tag, the sequence for the GADD45G protein should begin. Let's look at the next codons in the sequence.\n    *   The sequence after the HA tag (`...TAC GCC`) is `AAA TGA...`.\n    *   Let's translate these next two codons:\n        *   `AAA` -> Lysine (K)\n        *   `TGA` -> This is a **STOP codon**. In mRNA, this would be UGA.\n\n5.  **Identify the Problem:** The ribosome initiates translation at `ATG`, successfully translates the HA tag and one additional amino acid (Lysine), and then immediately encounters a `TGA` stop codon. This signals the translation machinery to dissociate from the mRNA, terminating protein synthesis.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Consequence:** Instead of producing the full-length GADD45G-HA fusion protein, the cell will only produce a tiny, non-functional peptide of 11 amino acids (M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K). This perfectly explains why the researcher is \"unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.\"\n\n7.  **Review the Options:**\n    *   A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation: This is incorrect. The DNA sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC` correctly codes for the YPYDVPDYA peptide. The last codon, `GCC`, is a valid codon for Alanine. There is no missense mutation.\n    *   B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain: This is not the primary cause. While linkers can be important, the main problem here is that the full-length protein is not synthesized in the first place due to the premature stop codon.\n    *   C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse: This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA` (UGA in mRNA), not `TAA` (UAA in mRNA). Second, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation.\n    *   D) The ribosome terminated the translation early: This is correct. The presence of the `TGA` stop codon shortly after the start codon causes premature termination of translation, preventing the synthesis of the full-length protein.\n\n<<<D>>>"
