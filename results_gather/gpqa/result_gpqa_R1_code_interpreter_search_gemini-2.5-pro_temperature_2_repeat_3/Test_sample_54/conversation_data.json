    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown organic compound.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula from Integration:**\n\n*   First, sum the integration values of all the signals: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H.\n*   This means the molecule contains a total of 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Let's check the number of hydrogens in the possible compounds:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): Has 8 hydrogens.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): Has 10 hydrogens.\n*   Since the total integration corresponds to 8 hydrogens, the unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options A (Trans-butenyl acetate) and D (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**2. Assign the Signals to the Protons of Propenyl Acetate:**\n\nThe structure of propenyl acetate is CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3. We have four distinct sets of protons.\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   This is a singlet (s), meaning it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   The integration is 3H.\n    *   The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (the acetate methyl). This perfectly matches the -O-CO-**CH3** group.\n\n*   **Signals for the Propenyl Group (CH3-CH=CH-):**\n    We have three signals left for the three types of protons in this group.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a doublet (d) with an integration of 3H. This corresponds to the methyl group (**CH3**-CH=) on the double bond. It is split into a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent vinyl proton.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a doublet (d) for one proton (1H). It is the most downfield signal (highest ppm value), which indicates it is heavily deshielded. In an enol acetate structure like this, the proton on the carbon attached to the oxygen (=CH-O) is the most deshielded. So, this signal corresponds to the -CH=**CH**-O- proton. It is a doublet because it is coupled to the other vinyl proton.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is a doublet of quartets (dq) for one proton (1H). This signal must correspond to the remaining proton in the middle of the propenyl chain (-**CH**=CH-O-).\n        *   It is coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm), causing it to split into a **doublet**.\n        *   It is also coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm), causing it to split into a **quartet** (3+1=4).\n        *   Therefore, the multiplicity is a doublet of quartets, which matches the data.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\n*   The distinction between cis and trans isomers is determined by the coupling constant (J) between the two vinyl protons (the ones on the double bond).\n*   The typical range for the vicinal coupling constant (Â³J) across a double bond is:\n    *   **Trans:** 12 - 18 Hz (large coupling)\n    *   **Cis:** 6 - 12 Hz (small coupling)\n*   The data for the signal at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   This large value falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the total number of protons (8H), the signal assignments, and particularly the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
