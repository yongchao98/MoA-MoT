    "This problem involves a sequence of two quantum measurements on a system. To find the joint probability of the outcomes, we must calculate the probability of the first measurement, determine the state of the system after it collapses, and then calculate the probability of the second measurement on this new state. The total probability is the product of these two probabilities.\n\n**1. Define the initial state and operators:**\n\n*   The unnormalized initial state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    `|ψ_un⟩ = [[-1], [2], [1]]`\n*   The operator for observable P is:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   The operator for observable Q is:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n**2. Normalize the initial state:**\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the state vector `|ψ_un⟩`. The squared norm is:\n`⟨ψ_un|ψ_un⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalization factor is `1/√6`.\nThe normalized initial state `|ψ⟩` is:\n`|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\n**3. First Measurement: Measuring P to get the outcome 0**\n\nThe possible outcomes of measuring P are its eigenvalues. We are interested in the outcome `p=0`. We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.\n\n*   **Find eigenvalues of P:** We solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n    `det([[ -λ, 1/√2,   0 ], [1/√2,  -λ, 1/√2], [  0, 1/√2,  -λ ]]) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ = 0`\n    This gives `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`, so the eigenvalues are `λ = 0, 1, -1`.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for p = 0:** Let the eigenvector be `|p=0⟩`. We solve `P|p=0⟩ = 0 * |p=0⟩`.\n    If `|p=0⟩ = [[x], [y], [z]]`, then:\n    1.  `(1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0`\n    2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x = -z`\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[[x], [0], [-x]]`. Normalizing this (`x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1`) gives `2x² = 1`, so `x = 1/√2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector for `p=0` is `|p=0⟩ = [[1/√2], [0], [-1/√2]]`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring p = 0:** This probability, `Prob(p=0)`, is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state `|ψ⟩` onto the eigenvector `|p=0⟩`.\n    `Prob(p=0) = |⟨p=0|ψ⟩|²`\n    `⟨p=0|ψ⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] · (1/√6) * [[-1], [2], [1]]`\n    `= (1/√6) * [ (1/√2)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1/√2)(1) ]`\n    `= (1/√6) * (-1/√2 - 1/√2) = (1/√6) * (-2/√2) = (1/√6) * (-√2) = -√(2/6) = -1/√3`\n    `Prob(p=0) = | -1/√3 |² = 1/3`\n\n**4. State Collapse**\n\nAfter measuring P and getting the result 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p=0⟩ = [[1/√2], [0], [-1/√2]]`\n\n**5. Second Measurement: Measuring Q to get the outcome -1**\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. We are interested in the outcome `q=-1`.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for q = -1:** The operator Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements `(1, 0, -1)`, and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `q=-1` is:\n    `|q=-1⟩ = [[0], [0], [1]]`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring q = -1:** This is the conditional probability `Prob(q=-1 | p=0)`. It is the squared magnitude of the projection of the collapsed state `|ψ'⟩` onto the eigenvector `|q=-1⟩`.\n    `Prob(q=-1 | p=0) = |⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩|²`\n    `⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] · [[1/√2], [0], [-1/√2]]`\n    `= (0)(1/√2) + (0)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) = -1/√2`\n    `Prob(q=-1 | p=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**6. Calculate the Joint Probability**\n\nThe total probability of getting `p=0` followed by `q=-1` is the product of the individual probabilities calculated:\n`Total Probability = Prob(p=0) * Prob(q=-1 | p=0)`\n`Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
