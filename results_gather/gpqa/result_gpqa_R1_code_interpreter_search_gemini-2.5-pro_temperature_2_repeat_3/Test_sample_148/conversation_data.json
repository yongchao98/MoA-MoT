    "*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The key observation is the presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this means the proton exists in two different chemical environments. The fact that the peaks have roughly equal integrals summing to one proton equivalent suggests that there are two distinct molecular species present in a roughly 1:1 ratio, and each species contains one of these alpha-protons.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The LC-MS analysis confirms the presence of two distinct species, as they separate into two peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). The fact that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product, confirms that these two species are isomers of each other (i.e., they have the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms). The equal intensities of the LC peaks correlate with the equal integrals in the NMR spectrum, reinforcing the idea of a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) Contamination with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. This contradicts the LC-MS data, which shows both peaks have the same mass as the product.\n\n    *   **B) Mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and, crucially, different NMR spectra in a standard achiral solvent. They can also be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. The presence of two separable isomers with distinct NMR signals is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. In peptide chemistry, this can happen in two common ways:\n        1.  **Racemization:** One of the chiral alpha-carbons of an amino acid residue might have inverted its stereochemistry during the synthesis (e.g., L-amino acid converting to a D-amino acid). If the peptide contains other chiral centers, the product will be a mixture of diastereomers (e.g., L-Ala-L-Phe and L-Ala-D-Phe are diastereomers).\n        2.  **Atropisomerism (Rotamers):** There is a high energy barrier to rotation around the amide (peptide) bond. This can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* conformers. These conformers are rotamers, and if the peptide is chiral, the *cis* and *trans* rotamers are diastereomers of each other. This phenomenon is particularly common for peptide bonds preceding a proline residue. These rotamers interconvert, but often slowly enough to be observed as separate species by NMR and sometimes even be separated by LC. This explanation perfectly fits all the observations: two isomeric species (same mass) that are distinct in both NMR and LC. The elevated temperature for LC-MS might be required for good chromatography, but the energy barrier is still high enough for the rotamers to be resolved on the column.\n\n    *   **C) Mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they are indistinguishable by standard 1H NMR (they would give a single set of peaks) and cannot be separated by standard (achiral) LC. This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling':** This term is ambiguous, but it implies a side reaction that would likely lead to a product with a different structure and possibly a different mass (e.g., an isopeptide bond or anhydride formation). While it might produce an isomer in some specific cases, the term \"mixture of diastereoisomers\" (B) is a more precise and general description of the observed species that perfectly aligns with the analytical data. The most common reason for these observations in peptide analysis is the formation of diastereomers, either through racemization or, more frequently, through cis/trans isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two isomers that are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR points directly to a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
