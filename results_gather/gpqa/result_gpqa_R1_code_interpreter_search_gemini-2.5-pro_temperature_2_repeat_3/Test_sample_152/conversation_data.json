    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** NaOEt, EtOH (Sodium ethoxide in ethanol)\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition\n\n1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, which is acidic due to the two adjacent ester groups. This forms a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic. Its structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`.\n3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons shift, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃  →  (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-⁻CH-COOCH₃` (This is one resonance structure of the intermediate enolate).\n4.  **Protonation:** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final product.\n    `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n5.  **Product A:** The structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`. This compound can be named as a substituted propane tricarboxylate. The IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** MeOH, H₃O⁺\n*   **Type:** Stork Enamine Synthesis (which involves a Michael Addition)\n\n1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring).\n2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n3.  **Reaction:** The α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a new C-C bond.\n4.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) first protonates the intermediate anion and then hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a carbonyl group. The piperidine is removed, and a ketone is formed at the C1 position of the cyclohexane ring.\n5.  **Product B:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position. The added group is `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. So the structure is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. Naming it as a derivative of butanenitrile, it becomes **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition (Retrosynthesis)\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Reaction:** We need to find the starting material 'C'. The reaction is a Michael addition. This reaction forms a bond between a nucleophile (the donor) and the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl/nitrile compound (the acceptor).\n2.  **Identify Donor and Acceptor fragments:** The acceptor is given as but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`. In a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂=`). After protonation, the MVK fragment becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n3.  **Match Fragments:** This `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` fragment is exactly the (3-oxobutyl) group attached at the C2 position of the product, `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n4.  **Identify Reactant C:** Therefore, the Michael donor ('C') must be the other part of the product: **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic methylene group at C2 (between the two carbonyls) to generate the nucleophilic enolate that initiates the reaction. The most appropriate way to write the starting material is in its neutral diketone form.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
