    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `14.28%` is equivalent to `0.1428`, which is very close to the fraction `1/7`.\n    *   Let's test this: `m / (12n + m) = 1/7` => `7m = 12n + m` => `6m = 12n` => `m = 2n`.\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). All of these fit the CnH2n formula.\n    *   The crucial clue is that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only one* substance, Z. This means that all reactive components in both mixtures must share the same carbon skeleton, which upon saturation, yields Z.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It \"does not decolorize bromine water\", which typically means it contains saturated compounds (alkanes or cycloalkanes) and is not aromatic, or at least does not contain simple alkenes/alkynes.\n    *   Substance Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is Z, the cycloalkane CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. If Y consists of `Y1` and `Y2`, and `Y1 = Z`, then hydrogenation of `Y2` must also yield Z.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction (X → Y)**\n    *   Mixture X is transformed into mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is described as a disproportionation.\n    *   A disproportionation reaction in organic chemistry is typically a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen or gains oxygen) and reduced (gains hydrogen or loses oxygen). For hydrocarbons, this usually means hydrogen transfer.\n    *   So, some component(s) in X are reduced, and some are oxidized to form the components of Y.\n    *   Let the two components of X be `X1 (CnH_a)` and `X2 (CnH_b)`.\n    *   Let the two components of Y be `Y1 (CnH_c)` and `Y2 (CnH_d)`.\n    *   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the overall reaction stoichiometry is likely `X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2`.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides. `C(2n)H(a+b) → C(2n)H(c+d)`. This means `a + b = c + d`.\n\n4.  **Revisiting Mixture Y and a Key Interpretation**\n    *   Initially, one might assume that because Y is \"saturated,\" both components must be cycloalkanes (e.g., Y1=cyclohexane, Y2=methylcyclopentane). This would mean `c=d=2n`. This leads to `a+b = 4n`.\n    *   However, mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning its components are unsaturated. Thus, `a < 2n` and `b < 2n`. This leads to a contradiction: `a+b` must be less than `4n`.\n    *   This contradiction suggests a flaw in the interpretation. The key lies in the phrase \"does not decolorize bromine water\". While this strictly means saturated, in the context of many chemistry problems, it's used to distinguish reactive alkenes/alkynes from the less reactive aromatic compounds. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions (it requires a Lewis acid catalyst). Let's test the hypothesis that one of the products in Y is aromatic.\n    *   Let's assume the reaction is a classic hydrogen transfer producing a cycloalkane and an aromatic ring.\n    *   Let `Y1 = Z = CnH2n` (a cycloalkane).\n    *   Let `Y2` be the corresponding aromatic compound, `Cn H(n)` (e.g., if n=6, benzene C6H6). This fits the `m=n` for typical aromatic rings like benzene, though more accurately `C6H6` hydrogenates to `C6H12`. Let's test with `n=6`, which is the most common for these reactions.\n    *   So let's hypothesize: `Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)`.\n    *   And `Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}`.\n    *   Let's check if this Y fits the description:\n        *   Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Yes.\n        *   \"Does not decolorize bromine water\": Plausible under this interpretation.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Yes, this works.\n        *   Z is a constituent of Y: Yes, cyclohexane is present.\n\n5.  **Determine the Composition of Mixture X**\n    *   If `Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}`, the total formula of the products (`Y1+Y2`) is `C12H18`.\n    *   Therefore, the total formula of the reactants (`X1+X2`) must also be `C12H18`.\n    *   So, for `X1 (C6Ha)` and `X2 (C6Hb)`, we must have `a + b = 18`.\n    *   Now we need to find two different liquids, X1 and X2, that fit the remaining conditions:\n        *   They must be C6 compounds.\n        *   They must be unsaturated (decolorize Br2 water).\n        *   They must not contain conjugated multiple bonds.\n        *   They must both hydrogenate to give only cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's choose a pair of molecules with `a+b=18`. A good candidate pair is one with 10 hydrogens and one with 8 hydrogens.\n        *   **X1 = C6H10**: A C6 alkene. **Cyclohexene** fits perfectly. It is a liquid, unsaturated, not conjugated, and its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\n        *   **X2 = C6H8**: A C6 diene. To satisfy the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule, we can't use cyclohexa-1,3-diene. However, **cyclohexa-1,4-diene** fits perfectly. It is a liquid, unsaturated, non-conjugated, and its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\n    *   So, a viable composition for mixture X is `{cyclohexene, cyclohexa-1,4-diene}`.\n\n6.  **Verify the Reaction**\n    *   The proposed transformation is:\n        `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`\n    *   This reaction is a plausible intermolecular hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). The cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and the cyclohexa-1,4-diene is oxidized to benzene.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are satisfied with this model.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The options are A) 16, B) 12, C) 22, D) 18. Our calculated value is 18, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
