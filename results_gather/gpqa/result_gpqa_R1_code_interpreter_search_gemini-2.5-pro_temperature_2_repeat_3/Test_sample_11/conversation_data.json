    "This is a particle decay problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Setup the Problem:**\n\nThe decay is given by:\n$\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu$\n\nThe initial particle, the pion ($\\pi^+$), is stationary. This means its initial momentum is zero, and its initial total energy is its rest energy.\n\n*   Initial Momentum: $p_{initial} = 0$\n*   Initial Energy: $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2$\n\nThe product particles are the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the muon neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$). We will assume the neutrino is massless, which is a standard and very accurate approximation for this type of problem.\n\n*   Final Momentum: $\\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n*   Final Energy: $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    $p_{initial} = p_{final}$\n    $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    This implies $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} = - \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n    This means the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n**3. Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n\nThe total energy of a particle is given by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n*   For the muon ($\\mu^+$):\n    $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n*   For the massless neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$):\n    $E_{\\nu} = pc$ (since its rest mass $m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$)\n\n**4. Solve for Momentum (p):**\n\nSubstitute the energy expressions into the energy conservation equation:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\nRearrange to solve for 'pc':\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nThe $(pc)^2$ terms on both sides cancel out:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nIsolate the 'pc' term:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 = 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc)$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\n**5. Calculate Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n\n*   **KE of Neutrino:** Since the neutrino is considered massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n    $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$\n\n*   **KE of Muon:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy.\n    $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu^+}c^2$\n    We can find $E_{\\mu}$ from the energy conservation equation:\n    $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu}$\n    So, $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu}) - m_{\\mu^+}c^2$\n\nNow, let's use the given values to compute the results.\n\nGiven:\n*   Rest energy of $\\pi^+$ ($m_{\\pi^+}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of $\\mu^+$ ($m_{\\mu^+}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n\n```python\n# Given rest energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the momentum of the decay products (pc) in MeV\n# pc = ( (m_pi_c2)^2 - (m_mu_c2)^2 ) / ( 2 * m_pi_c2 )\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to pc\nKE_neutrino = pc\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon\n# E_mu = sqrt(pc^2 + (m_mu_c2)^2)\n# Alternatively, from energy conservation: E_mu = m_pi_c2 - E_neutrino\nE_mu = m_pi_c2 - KE_neutrino\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy\nKE_muon = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Print the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino, rounded to two decimal places.\n# The question lists the answers as KE_muon, KE_neutrino\nprint(f\"{KE_muon:.2f} MeV, {KE_neutrino:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n4.12 MeV, 29.78 MeV\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the kinetic energy of the muon ($\\mu^+$) is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino ($\\nu$) is approximately 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78).\n\nThese values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires applying the principles of conservation of relativistic energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Identify Knowns and Unknowns:**\n\n*   **Initial Particle:** Pion ($\\pi^+$) at rest.\n    *   Rest Mass Energy ($m_{\\pi^+}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n    *   Initial Momentum ($p_{\\pi}$) = 0\n    *   Initial Total Energy ($E_{\\pi}$) = $m_{\\pi^+}c^2$ = 139.6 MeV\n*   **Final Particles:** Muon ($\\mu^+$) and Muon Neutrino ($\\nu_{\\mu}$).\n    *   Rest Mass Energy of Muon ($m_{\\mu^+}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n    *   Rest Mass Energy of Neutrino ($m_{\\nu}c^2$) is approximately 0 MeV.

Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n\nSince the initial pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n$ \\vec{p}_{\\text{initial}} = \\vec{p}_{\\text{final}} $\n$ 0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} $\nThis means the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n$ |\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p $\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n\nThe total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n$ E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}} $\n$ m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} $\nwhere $E_{\\mu}$ and $E_{\\nu}$ are the total relativistic energies of the muon and neutrino.\n\n**4. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n\nThe total energy of a particle is given by the relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n*   For the muon ($\\mu^+$):\n    $ E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} $\n*   For the neutrino ($\\nu_{\\mu}$), since we assume its rest mass is zero:\n    $ E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0^2} = pc $\n\n**5.
