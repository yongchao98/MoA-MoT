    "This question asks to identify the set of assumptions that collectively form the basis for the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each of the given statements.\n\nThe **impulse approximation** simplifies complex many-body nuclear interactions by treating the interaction as occurring with a single, individual nucleon within the nucleus. The core idea is that the interaction with an external probe (like a photon or an electron) is so rapid and energetic that the struck nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle during the brief moment of interaction. The other nucleons are considered mere \"spectators.\"\n\nLet's analyze each assumption:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    This is the most fundamental tenet of the impulse approximation. It posits that the probe interacts with a single nucleon at a time, rather than with pairs of nucleons (via meson-exchange currents) or the nucleus as a collective whole. Without this assumption, one cannot even begin to treat the problem as an interaction with a quasi-free nucleon. This assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    This assumption addresses what happens *after* the primary interaction. If the struck nucleon, or the scattered probe, re-interacts with the other nucleons on its way out of the nucleus (a phenomenon known as Final State Interactions, or FSI), the final measured state would be distorted and would not accurately reflect the initial one-body interaction. Assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" is equivalent to neglecting FSI. While some more sophisticated models go beyond this, the simplest and most common form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation or PWIA) relies on this assumption. It is crucial for ensuring that what is detected is representative of the initial \"impulse\" event.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, describing it as a bound state of quarks. However, the impulse approximation is about the behavior of the *nucleon as a whole* within the nuclear medium. It treats the nucleon as the fundamental entity of the interaction. Whether its constituent quarks are treated relativistically or non-relativistically is a separate question related to the specific model of the nucleon's form factor, not the impulse approximation itself. In fact, the impulse approximation is widely used in high-energy electron scattering (deep inelastic scattering) where the quarks are known to be highly relativistic. Therefore, this assumption is not required for the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    This is the \"impulse\" part of the approximation. The idea is that the interaction time is extremely short. Over this very short duration, the influence of the relatively slowly varying nuclear potential that binds the nucleon is negligible. The nucleon is effectively \"frozen\" in its momentum state for the moment of the collision and doesn't have time to exchange momentum with the rest of the nucleus via the binding forces. This allows us to treat it as a free particle (with a specific initial momentum) at the instant of the interaction. This assumption is essential.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe assumptions that are essential to the impulse approximation are:\n*   The interaction is with a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n*   The effects of the nuclear environment are negligible during the interaction, meaning no binding forces act (Statement 4) and the products of the interaction escape without further scattering (Statement 2).\n\nTherefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 jointly imply the impulse approximation as it is commonly used in nuclear physics calculations.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
