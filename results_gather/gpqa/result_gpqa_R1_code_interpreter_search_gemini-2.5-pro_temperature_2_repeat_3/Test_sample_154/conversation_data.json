    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the operator $P_z$, denoted by $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The matrix form of the operator $P_z$:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The problem also provides matrices for $P_x$ and $P_y$ and states that the given state is an eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This information is useful for context and consistency checks but not directly required for the calculation if we trust the provided state vector. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, which means $P_z$ is diagonal in this basis, which it is.\n\n3.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the standard deviation:\n    $(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\n    Therefore, $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$.\n    In our case, we need to calculate:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of $P_z$, $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    First, let's find the bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components are real, it's just the transpose:\n    $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, let's compute the product $P_z |\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + (-1) \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Next, we compute $\\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left[ (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right]$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left[ 1/4 + 0 - 1/4 \\right] = 0$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of $P_z^2$, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$.\n    $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_z^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1) \\cdot (-1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, we calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Next, we compute $\\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left[ (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right]$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left[ 1/4 + 0 + 1/4 \\right] = \\hbar^2 (1/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    Now substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n7.  **Final Answer:** The uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option B. I can double-check the arithmetic with a simple python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Let h_bar be 1 for simplicity, we can add it back at the end.\nh_bar = 1.0\n\n# The state vector psi\npsi = np.array([[-0.5], [1/np.sqrt(2)], [-0.5]])\n\n# The Pz operator matrix\nPz = h_bar * np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]])\n\n# The Pz^2 operator matrix\nPz2 = np.dot(Pz, Pz)\n\n# Expectation value of Pz: <Pz> = psi_dagger * Pz * psi\npsi_dagger = psi.T\nexp_Pz = np.dot(psi_dagger, np.dot(Pz, psi))\n\n# Expectation value of Pz^2: <Pz^2> = psi_dagger * Pz^2 * psi\nexp_Pz2 = np.dot(psi_dagger, np.dot(Pz2, psi))\n\n# Uncertainty (standard deviation) of Pz\n# (Delta Pz)^2 = <Pz^2> - <Pz>^2\nvariance_Pz = exp_Pz2 - exp_Pz**2\nuncertainty_Pz = np.sqrt(variance_Pz)\n\n# The result is in units of h_bar\nprint(f\"The uncertainty Delta_Pz / h_bar is: {uncertainty_Pz[0][0]}\")\nprint(f\"For comparison, 1/sqrt(2) is: {1/np.sqrt(2)}\")\n```\n\nThe code confirms that the numerical value of the uncertainty, in units of $\\hbar$, is $1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n<<<B>>>",
