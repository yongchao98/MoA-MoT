    "Here is a breakdown of the physics principles and calculations used to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Setup and Principles:**\n\n*   **System:** We have an electron-positron pair before a collision and two photons after the collision.\n*   **Coordinate System:** Let's define the direction of the electron's initial movement as the positive x-axis. Therefore, the positron is moving along the negative x-axis.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** In any isolated collision, both total energy and total momentum must be conserved. Since this involves particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use the equations from special relativity.\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy and Momentum:**\n\n*   The energy `E` of a particle with rest mass `m` and Lorentz factor `γ` is given by `E = γmc²`.\n*   The momentum `p` of such a particle is given by `p = sqrt((E/c)² - (mc)²) = mc * sqrt(γ² - 1)`.\n*   For a photon, which has zero rest mass (`m=0`), its energy is `E_ph` and its momentum is `p_ph = E_ph / c`.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):**\n    *   Energy of the electron (`E_e`) = `γ_e * mc² = 4mc²`\n    *   Energy of the positron (`E_p`) = `γ_p * mc² = 2mc²`\n    *   Total initial energy `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):**\n    *   The final state consists of two photons. The problem states they have equal energy, let's call it `E_ph`.\n    *   Total final energy `E_final = E_ph + E_ph = 2E_ph`\n*   **Conservation:**\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`\n    *   `6mc² = 2E_ph`\n    *   This tells us the energy of each photon is `E_ph = 3mc²`.\n\n**4. Applying Conservation of Momentum:**\n\n*   Momentum is a vector, so we must consider its components (in the x and y directions).\n*   **Initial Momentum (P_initial):**\n    *   The particles are only moving along the horizontal (x-axis), so the initial momentum in the y-direction is zero (`P_initial_y = 0`).\n    *   Momentum of the electron (`p_e`) = `mc * sqrt(γ_e² - 1) = mc * sqrt(4² - 1) = mc * sqrt(15)` (in the +x direction).\n    *   Momentum of the positron (`p_p`) = `mc * sqrt(γ_p² - 1) = mc * sqrt(2² - 1) = mc * sqrt(3)` (in the -x direction).\n    *   Total initial x-momentum `P_initial_x = p_e - p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * mc`.\n*   **Final Momentum (P_final):**\n    *   The two photons move away at angles `θ` and `-θ` relative to the x-axis. The total angle between them is `2θ`.\n    *   The momentum of each photon is `p_ph = E_ph / c = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n    *   The y-component of momentum for the first photon is `p_ph * sin(θ)` and for the second is `p_ph * sin(-θ) = -p_ph * sin(θ)`. The sum is `P_final_y = 0`, which conserves momentum in the y-direction.\n    *   The x-component of momentum for each photon is `p_ph * cos(θ)`.\n    *   Total final x-momentum `P_final_x = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ)`.\n*   **Conservation:**\n    *   `P_initial_x = P_final_x`\n    *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * mc = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ)`\n    *   Substitute `p_ph = 3mc`:\n    *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * mc = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ)`\n    *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * mc = 6mc * cos(θ)`\n\n**5. Solving for the Angle:**\n\n*   We can cancel the `mc` term from both sides of the equation:\n    *   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n*   Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    *   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n*   Using a calculator:\n    *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n*   Find `θ` by taking the inverse cosine (arccos):\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n*   The question asks for the total angle between the two photons, which is `2θ`:\n    *   `Total Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°`\n\nThis value matches the calculation performed by the Python script and is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
