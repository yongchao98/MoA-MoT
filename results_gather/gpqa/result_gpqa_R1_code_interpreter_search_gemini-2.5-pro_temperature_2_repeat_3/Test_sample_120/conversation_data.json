    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct product:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Structure:** This name describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring. The bicyclo[4.1.0] system with a 7-oxa designation indicates an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons of a 6-membered ring. The bridgehead carbons where the epoxide is fused are C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations at the chiral centers are given: 1R, 3R, 4R, 6S. This precisely defines the 3D structure of the molecule. We don't need to draw the entire molecule in 3D to solve the problem, but we must use the given stereochemical information.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction\n*   **Reagents:** The epoxide is reacted with **Me₂CuLi** (lithium dimethylcuprate), which is a Gilman reagent. This reagent acts as a source of the soft nucleophile, methyl anion (CH₃⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide ring. The problem provides the rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** \"The alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\"\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** \"Inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile (Nu) is added.\" This is a classic feature of an Sₙ2-type reaction.\n\n### 3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack\nThe nucleophile (Me⁻) will attack one of the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 or C6. We need to determine which is less sterically hindered.\n\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to the epoxide oxygen, C2, C6, and a **methyl group**. It is a quaternary carbon (within the bicyclic system context).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to the epoxide oxygen, C1, C5, and a **hydrogen atom**. It is a tertiary carbon.\n\nComparing the two, the presence of a methyl group at C1 makes it significantly more sterically hindered than C6, which only has a hydrogen atom. Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThe reaction causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked.\n\n*   The site of attack is C6.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given in the name as **6S**.\n*   The reaction will invert this configuration from S to **R**.\n\nAfter the attack and subsequent workup (to protonate the resulting alkoxide), a new chiral center is formed at the location of the old C6. To name the final product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon chain is renumbered. The carbon bearing the new -OH group (from the epoxide oxygen) gets the highest priority and is designated C1.\n\n*   The old C1 becomes the new C1 (bearing the OH group).\n*   The old C6 (the site of attack) is adjacent to the old C1, so it will become the new **C2**.\n*   The other carbons are renumbered accordingly around the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The resulting name is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, as shown in options B and D.\n\nSince the configuration at the old C6 (which was **S**) is inverted, the configuration at the new C2 must be **R**.\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\nWe are looking for a product named `...-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` with an **R** configuration at C2. Let's examine the relevant options:\n\n*   **A) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** The numbering (2,2-dimethyl) is incorrect.\n*   **B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** The numbering is correct, and the configuration at C2 is **2R**. This matches our deduction.\n*   **C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** The numbering (2,2-dimethyl) is incorrect.\n*   **D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** The numbering is correct, but the configuration at C2 is **2S**. This contradicts our deduction.\n\nBased on the principle of inversion of configuration at the less hindered carbon C6, the product must have a 2R configuration. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
