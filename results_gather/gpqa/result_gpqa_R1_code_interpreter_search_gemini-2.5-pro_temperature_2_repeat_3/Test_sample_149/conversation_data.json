    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   DoU = C + 1 + (N/2) - (H/2)\n    *   DoU = 8 + 1 + (1/2) - (9/2) = 9 + 0.5 - 4.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 is indicative of a substituted benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (a C=C, C=O, or C=N bond, or another ring).\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Data:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets integrating to 2 protons each, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet in the aliphatic region integrating to 2 protons. This corresponds to a CH2 group. The doublet splitting means it's adjacent to a carbon with 1 proton (a CH group), which in this case is the aldehyde's CH.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and a 2-oxoethyl group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the structure **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**. Let's verify it matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n        *   C: 6 (ring) + 2 (side chain) = 8\n        *   H: 4 (ring) + 2 (NH2) + 2 (CH2) + 1 (CHO) = 9\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 1\n    *   The structure is consistent with the formula and all NMR signals. The -NH2 group is electron-donating, shielding the ortho protons (6.51 ppm), and the -CH2CHO group is weakly electron-withdrawing.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent mixture is used for diazotization. The primary aromatic amine group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   *Starting Material:* 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n    *   *Product after Step 1:* 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt (often with gentle warming) leads to hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water.\n    *   *Intermediate Product:* 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step subjects the intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, to a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:**\n        1.  The base (OH-) removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde (the protons on the -CH2- group) to form an enolate.\n        2.  This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n        3.  After protonation, this forms an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n    *   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):**\n        The \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. The alpha-proton (on C2) and the beta-hydroxyl group (on C3) are eliminated to form a stable, conjugated C=C double bond. This process is called condensation.\n        *   Aldol Adduct: `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(PhOH)-CHO`\n        *   Dehydration removes the H from C2 and the OH from C3.\n        *   Final Product: `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO`\n\n*   **Identify the Final Product:**\n    *   The name of the condensation product `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO` is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   This matches option **A**.\n    *   Option (C) is the intermediate aldol adduct, but the inclusion of \"Heat\" indicates the reaction proceeds to the final condensation product.\n    *   Option (B) has an incorrect molecular formula.\n    *   Option (D) incorrectly has phenyl groups instead of the hydroxyphenyl groups that are formed in the second step of the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
