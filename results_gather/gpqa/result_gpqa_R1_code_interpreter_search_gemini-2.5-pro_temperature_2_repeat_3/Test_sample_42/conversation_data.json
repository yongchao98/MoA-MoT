    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Chemical Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to build a model of the molecule.\n-   **Core:** A benzene ring.\n-   **Highest Priority Group:** The problem lists a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which, according to IUPAC rules, is the highest priority among the given functional groups. This means the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n-   **Substituent Positions relative to C1 (-COOH):**\n    -   *ortho* (C2 and C6): one hydroxyl (-OH) group and one dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group.\n    -   *para* (C4): one methoxy (-OCH₃) group.\n-   **Meta-related groups:** The carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group are all *meta* to one another. This means they are in a 1,3,5-relationship on the ring. Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n-   **Final constraint for positioning:** The methoxy group (-OCH₃) and the alcohol/hydroxyl group (-OH) are both *ortho* (adjacent) to the nitrile/cyano group (-CN).\n\nLet's use this information to determine the exact position of each substituent.\n1.  Place -COOH at **C1**.\n2.  Place -OCH₃ at **C4** (para to C1).\n3.  The -CHO and -CN groups are at **C3** and **C5**.\n4.  The -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ groups are at **C2** and **C6**.\n5.  Now use the final constraint: -OCH₃ (at C4) and -OH are ortho to -CN.\n    -   The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. So -CN must be at C3 or C5, which is consistent.\n    -   Let's test if **-CN is at C3**. The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C2. This works.\n    -   Let's test if **-CN is at C5**. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C6. This also works.\n\nWe have two potential arrangements which are actually the same molecule, just numbered differently from C1:\n-   **Arrangement A (Numbering Counter-Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n-   **Arrangement B (Numbering Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH\n\n### 2. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nThe principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1. We must number the remaining carbons to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants (numbers).\n-   In both Arrangement A and Arrangement B, the locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n-   When the locant sets are identical, IUPAC rules state that we must give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nNow let's compare the two numbering arrangements based on the position of the alphabetically first substituent, \"cyano\":\n-   In Arrangement A (counter-clockwise), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n-   In Arrangement B (clockwise), the cyano group is at **C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the counter-clockwise numbering of Arrangement A is correct.\n\nSo, the correct assignment of substituents is:\n-   C1: -COOH\n-   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n-   C3: -CN (cyano)\n-   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n-   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n-   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n\n### 3. Assemble the Final Name\n\nTo write the final IUPAC name, list the substituents (with their locants) in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  **3-cyano**\n2.  **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses are used for clarity with complex/substituted substituents)\n3.  **5-formyl**\n4.  **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these parts alphabetically gives the name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 4. Compare with the Given Options\n\n-   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering.*\n-   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - *Correct numbering, but prefixes are listed numerically, not alphabetically.*\n-   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *This exactly matches our derived name.*\n-   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering and incorrect alphabetical order.*\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
