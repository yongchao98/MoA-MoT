    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the principles of chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the product of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   When a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides.\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene will form a 1:1 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These two molecules are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Let's call this racemic epoxide mixture **E-Epoxide**.\n*   **Step 1b: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid. This is a ring-opening reaction where water acts as a nucleophile. The mechanism is SN2-like, proceeding with *anti*-addition (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the epoxide's C-O bond).\n    *   Starting with the racemic **E-Epoxide** and performing an *anti*-addition leads to a meso diol.\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide by H₂O (anti-attack) gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide by H₂O (anti-attack) gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are actually the *same* molecule. This molecule has a center of inversion and is achiral, making it a *meso* compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n*(Mnemonic: A common mnemonic for dihydroxylation is **TRAM**: **T**rans-alkene + **R**acemic intermediate (from syn-addition) -> **M**eso product (from anti-opening). Or more directly for the overall reaction: **Trans + Anti = Meso**)*\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the product of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   When a *cis*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a *meso* epoxide.\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene will form meso-4,5-epoxyoctane ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane). This single product is achiral. Let's call it **Z-Epoxide**.\n*   **Step 2b: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The *meso* **Z-Epoxide** undergoes *anti*-addition of H₂O.\n    *   Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4) of the meso-epoxide will give one enantiomer of the diol, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon (C5) will give the other enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n*(Mnemonic: The counterpart to the one above is **CAR**: **C**is-alkene + **A**nti-addition -> **R**acemic product)*\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three molecules have the following relationship:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol cannot be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers**, like the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties. Thus, the meso-diol will have a different retention time and elute as a **separate peak**.\n    *   Total peaks observed = 1 (for the enantiomeric pair) + 1 (for the meso-compound) = **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they will interact differently with the stationary phase.\n    *   The enantiomers (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the other two, will also have a different retention time and will be resolved as a **third distinct peak**.\n    *   Total peaks observed = 1 (for the meso-compound) + 1 (for the R,R-enantiomer) + 1 (for the S,S-enantiomer) = **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>"
