    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Conditions for Observation**\n\nA star must satisfy two main conditions to be observable by *both* the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs:\n\n*   **Visibility Condition:** The star must be visible in the sky from both observatory locations.\n*   **Magnitude Condition:** The star must be bright enough to be detected by both instruments.\n\nLet's break down each condition.\n\n#### **Condition 1: Visibility from Both Observatories**\n\nA star's visibility depends on its declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude ($\\phi$). An object is visible from a given latitude if it rises above the horizon. This is mathematically expressed as its declination $\\delta$ must be in the range $\\phi - 90^\\circ < \\delta < \\phi + 90^\\circ$. For an object to be seen from both observatories, it must satisfy this condition for both latitudes.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** The Wikipedia link gives a latitude of approximately 24° 37' S, which is **-24.6°**.\n    *   For a star to be visible, its declination ($\\delta$) must be greater than $-24.6^\\circ - 90^\\circ = -114.6^\\circ$. Since declination is always above -90°, this is always true.\n    *   However, for the star not to be permanently circumpolar in the southern sky (and thus never rise for Keck), it must be able to be seen from the north as well. The northernmost declination visible is $90^\\circ - 24.6^\\circ = 65.4^\\circ$. So, from Paranal, **$\\delta < +65.4^\\circ$**.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** The Wikipedia link gives a latitude of approximately 19° 49' N, which is **+19.8°**.\n    *   For a star to be visible, its declination ($\\delta$) must be greater than $19.8^\\circ - 90^\\circ = -70.2^\\circ$. So, from Keck, **$\\delta > -70.2^\\circ$**.\n\nTo be visible from both, a star's declination must be in the range **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n#### **Condition 2: Apparent Magnitude Limit**\n\nEach spectrograph has a limiting apparent magnitude.\n\n*   **ESPRESSO:** Can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag (m_V < 17.0).\n*   **HIRES:** Can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag (m_V < 16.0).\n\nFor a star to be detectable by *both*, it must meet the stricter requirement, which is the one from HIRES. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be **m_V < 16.0**.\n\n#### **Calculating Apparent Magnitude**\n\nWhen the apparent magnitude (m_V) is not given directly, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula:\n$m_V = M_V + 5 \\log_{10}(d) - 5 + A_V$\nwhere:\n*   $M_V$ is the absolute V magnitude.\n*   $d$ is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n*   $A_V$ is the extinction in the V band. We are told $A_V = 3.1 \\times E(B-V)$. If E(B-V) is not provided, we assume extinction is zero ($A_V=0$).\n\n### **2. Evaluate Each Star**\n\nNow, we will use a script to apply these conditions to each star.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef evaluate_stars():\n    # --- Conditions ---\n    # HIRES is the stricter magnitude limit\n    MAGNITUDE_LIMIT = 16.0\n\n    # Visibility limits based on observatory latitudes\n    # Keck (Lat ~+19.8 N): dec > 19.8 - 90 = -70.2\n    # Paranal (Lat ~-24.6 S): dec < 90 - 24.6 = +65.4\n    MIN_DEC = -70.2\n    MAX_DEC = 65.4\n\n    # --- Star Data ---\n    stars = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Star1\",\n            \"ra\": 15, \"dec\": -75, \"m_V\": None, \"M_V\": 15.5,\n            \"dist_pc\": 10, \"e_bv\": None\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Star2\",\n            \"ra\": 30, \"dec\": 55, \"m_V\": 16.5, \"M_V\": None,\n            \"dist_pc\": 5, \"e_bv\": None\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Star3\",\n            \"ra_h\": 11, \"dec\": 48, \"m_V\": 15.5, \"M_V\": None,\n            \"dist_pc\": 15, \"e_bv\": 0.6\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Star4\",\n            \"ra\": 85, \"dec\": -48, \"m_V\": None, \"M_V\": 15.5,\n            \"dist_pc\": 10, \"e_bv\": 0.4\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Star5\",\n            \"ra_h\": 10, \"dec\": 60, \"m_V\": None, \"M_V\": 16.5,\n            \"dist_pc\": 5, \"e_bv\": None\n        },\n    ]\n\n    candidates = []\n    print(\"Evaluating Stars...\\n\")\n\n    for star in stars:\n        # --- 1.

    "An analysis of the conditions required for a star to be observable by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs is as follows:\n\n### **1. Visibility Condition (Declination)**\n\nFor a star to be visible from an observatory, its declination must be within the range accessible from the observatory's latitude.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude ($\\phi$) of approximately -24.6°. A star is visible if its declination ($\\delta$) is greater than $\\phi - 90^\\circ$ and less than $90^\\circ - \\phi$. So for Paranal, the visible range is from $-114.6^\\circ$ to $+65.4^\\circ$. Since declination is always between -90° and +90°, the practical condition is **$\\delta < +65.4^\\circ$**.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at a latitude ($\\phi$) of approximately +19.8°. The visible range for Keck is from $\\phi - 90^\\circ$ to $90^\\circ - \\phi$, which translates to a declination range of **$\\delta > -70.2^\\circ$**.\n\nFor a star to be visible from *both* observatories, its declination must satisfy both conditions: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n### **2. Brightness Condition (Apparent Magnitude)**\n\nA star's brightness must exceed the limiting magnitude of each instrument.\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Apparent V magnitude ($m_V$) < 17.0\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Apparent V magnitude ($m_V$) < 16.0\n\nTo be detected by *both*, the star must satisfy the stricter limit, which is that of HIRES. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be **$m_V < 16.0$**.\n\nWhen not given directly, the apparent magnitude ($m_V$) is calculated from the absolute magnitude ($M_V$), distance ($d$ in parsecs), and visual extinction ($A_V$) using the distance modulus formula:\n$m_V = M_V + 5 \\log_{10}(d) - 5 + A_V$\nwhere $A_V = 3.1 \\times E(B-V)$.\n\n### **Evaluation of Each Star**\n\n*   **Star1:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the visible range for the Keck Observatory (>-70.2°). **Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star2:** DEC = 55°. This is visible from both observatories. However, its apparent V magnitude is 16.5, which is fainter than the HIRES limit (< 16.0). **Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star3:** DEC = 48°. This is visible from both observatories. Its apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, which is brighter than the HIRES limit (< 16.0). **Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star4:** DEC = -48°. This is visible from both observatories. To check its brightness, we must calculate its apparent magnitude:\n    *   $M_V = 15.5$\n    *   $d = 10$ pc\n    *   $A_V = 3.1 \\times E(B-V) = 3.1 \\times 0.4 = 1.24$\n    *   $m_V = 15.5 + 5 \\log_{10}(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74$\n    *   This magnitude (16.74) is fainter than the HIRES limit (< 16.0). **Not observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star5:** DEC = 60°. This is visible from both observatories. We calculate its apparent magnitude:\n    *   $M_V = 16.5$\n    *   $d = 5$ pc\n    *   $A_V = 0$ (as no extinction is mentioned)\n    *   $m_V = 16.5 + 5 \\log_{10}(5) - 5 + 0 \\approx 16.5 + 5(0.7) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.5 - 5 = 15.0$\n    *   This magnitude (~15.0) is brighter than the HIRES limit (< 16.0). **Observable by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only **Star3** and **Star5** meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<C>>>"
