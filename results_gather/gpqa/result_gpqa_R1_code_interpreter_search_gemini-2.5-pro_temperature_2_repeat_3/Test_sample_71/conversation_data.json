    "This is a multi-step synthesis problem that requires determining the structure of the final product and then analyzing its symmetry to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants**: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Analysis of Reagent Generation**: The combination of a polyhalogenated compound like 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with NaI at elevated temperature is a known method for generating a highly reactive intermediate via reductive dehalogenation. While the starting material's name is unusual, it serves as a precursor to o-xylylene (also known as o-quinodimethane). o-Xylylene is an excellent diene for Diels-Alder reactions. We will assume that 2 equivalents of o-xylylene are generated in situ.\n*   **Diels-Alder Reaction**: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative) has two double bonds and acts as a dienophile. It reacts with two equivalents of the o-xylylene diene in a sequential double Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   Norbornadiene systems typically undergo addition from the 'exo' face to avoid steric hindrance from the bicyclic structure.\n    *   The first Diels-Alder reaction occurs at one of the double bonds (e.g., C2-C3) with one molecule of o-xylylene. This saturates the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   The second Diels-Alder reaction occurs at the remaining double bond (C5-C6) with the second molecule of o-xylylene.\n*   **Structure of Product 1**: The final product of this double exo-addition is a highly symmetric molecule. The core is a saturated bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton. Two `benzo-fused` systems are attached to this core in an `exo,exo` fashion. The original C7 of the norbornadiene still bears the tert-butoxy (-OtBu) group. The molecule possesses C2v symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction**: Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4/H2O).\n*   **Analysis**: These are standard acidic conditions for the deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The -OtBu group is cleaved to yield a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Structure of Product 2**: The structure is identical to Product 1, but the -OtBu group at the bridge position (C7) is replaced by an -OH group. The C2v symmetry of the carbon skeleton is maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction**: Product 2 is treated with SO3-pyridine complex in DMSO.\n*   **Analysis**: This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing alcohols. The secondary alcohol at C7 is oxidized to a ketone.\n*   **Structure of Product 3**: The structure is the same as Product 2, but the -OH group at C7 is now a carbonyl group (C=O). Product 3 is a highly symmetric ketone, retaining the C2v point group.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Reaction**: Product 3 is heated at 150°C.\n*   **Analysis**: Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-7-one derivatives, like product 3, are generally thermally stable and do not undergo reactions like CO extrusion at a relatively low temperature of 150°C. This suggests that the question may be a trick, and no reaction occurs in this step. Therefore, Product 4 is the same as Product 3.\n*   **Task**: Count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 3 (or 4).\n\n**Symmetry Analysis and Counting of Distinct Hydrogens in Product 3/4:**\nThe molecule has C2v symmetry. Let's analyze the equivalence of the protons. The symmetry elements are a C2 axis passing through the C=O group and two perpendicular mirror planes.\n1.  **Bridgehead protons (H1, H4)**: The two bridgehead protons on C1 and C4 are equivalent. They are interconverted by the C2 axis. (1 type)\n2.  **Fusion protons (H2, H3, H5, H6)**: These four protons on the carbons where the new rings are fused are all equivalent due to the C2v symmetry. (1 type)\n3.  **Aromatic protons**: There are two benzene rings, equivalent by C2 symmetry. Let's consider one ring. This ring and its attached fused system is bisected by a mirror plane. This makes the two 'outer' protons equivalent to each other, and the two 'inner' protons equivalent to each other. Thus, there are two types of aromatic protons on each ring. Since the two rings are equivalent, there are a total of **2 types** of aromatic protons in the molecule. (Each type represents 4 hydrogens).\n4.  **Aliphatic bridge protons**: There are two bridges of the form -CH2-CH2- from the Diels-Alder additions. Let's consider one such bridge, for example, connecting C2 and C3. It is part of a puckered, chiral fused ring system. The four protons on this bridge are all stereochemically distinct (diastereotopic). None of the molecule's symmetry operations make any of these four protons equivalent. However, the C2 axis makes this entire bridge equivalent to the second bridge (on the C5-C6 side). Therefore, the 8 protons of the two bridges classify into **4 distinct types**. (Each type represents 2 hydrogens).\n\n**Total count**:\n*   Type 1: H1, H4 (2H)\n*   Type 2: H2, H3, H5, H6 (4H)\n*   Type 3: Aromatic set 1 (4H)\n*   Type 4: Aromatic set 2 (4H)\n*   Type 5: Aliphatic bridge set 1 (2H)\n*   Type 6: Aliphatic bridge set 2 (2H)\n*   Type 7: Aliphatic bridge set 3 (2H)\n*   Type 8: Aliphatic bridge set 4 (2H)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8.\n\n<<<D>>>"
