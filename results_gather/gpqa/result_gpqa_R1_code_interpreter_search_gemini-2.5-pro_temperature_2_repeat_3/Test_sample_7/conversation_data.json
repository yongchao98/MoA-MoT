As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "*   **Analysis of G2:**\n    1.  The wild-type (WT) has 100% resistance.\n    2.  The knockout mutant for G2 (`g2`) has 0% resistance, a complete loss of function.\n    3.  The double mutants involving `g2` (`g1g2` and `g2g3`) also show 0% resistance.\n    4.  When the phenotype of a mutation in one gene (in this case, `g2`) masks the phenotype of a mutation in another gene (`g1` or `g3`), this is called **epistasis**. The `g2` mutation is epistatic to both `g1` and `g3`.\n    5.  This strongly suggests that G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3 in the resistance pathway, or is an essential component that the functions of G1 and G3 depend upon. Since the prompt states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 is the most logical candidate for this transcription factor. This conclusion allows us to eliminate option D.\n\n*   **Analysis of G1 and G3:**\n    1.  The `g1` single mutant has a mild phenotype (75% resistance), and the `g3` single mutant has a moderate phenotype (50% resistance).\n    2.  The `g1g3` double mutant has a phenotype of 10% resistance. This is much more severe than either single mutant alone and also more severe than what would be expected from a simple additive effect (e.g., a 25% loss from `g1` and a 50% loss from `g3` would suggest 100-25-50=25% resistance).\n    3.  This synergistic interaction, where the double mutant phenotype is much stronger than the sum of individual mutant effects, is a classic sign of **gene redundancy**. G1 and G3 likely have overlapping or parallel functions that both contribute to pathogen resistance. When one is knocked out, the other can still provide partial function. When both are knocked out, the pathway they contribute to is almost completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** We've established G2 is likely the TF. However, \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect. If it were, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would be the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%), which it is not.\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** We've established G2 is the TF and that G1/G3 show gene redundancy. Both of these are strongly supported by the data. The claim \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect based on a classical definition (the `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the same as the `g1` phenotype of 75%). However, this option contains the two most accurate descriptions derived from the experiment.\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** The term **pleiotropy** means one gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measures one trait (resistance), so we have no evidence for pleiotropy. This makes the option incorrect.\n    *   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** As determined earlier, G2 is the upstream epistatic gene, not G1. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Option B provides the two most accurate interpretations of the data: that G2 is the upstream transcription factor and that G1 and G3 function redundantly. Although the clause \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is technically incorrect in its classical sense, the other two points are the core conclusions of this experiment, making it the best possible answer among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
