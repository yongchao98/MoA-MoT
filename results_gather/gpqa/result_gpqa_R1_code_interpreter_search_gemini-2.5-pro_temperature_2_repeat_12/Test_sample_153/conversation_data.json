    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopologue of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion. The relative intensity ratio is M+ : M+2 ≈ 100 : 32, which simplifies to approximately 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** This 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl. Thus, the molecular weight of the compound containing the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156. All the proposed options (chlorobenzoic acids, etc.) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Calculation: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. The mass spectrometry data is consistent with a compound of formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic, exceptionally broad absorption band for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option **C) Phenyl chloroformate**, which is an ester and would lack the broad O-H stretch. It also makes option **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** unlikely, as a phenolic O-H is typically less broad (e.g., 3500-3200 cm⁻¹) than a carboxylic acid O-H. The remaining plausible options are **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** and **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (δ > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s) (as it doesn't couple with other protons) confirms the -COOH group identified in the IR spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** The remaining signals, 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H), are in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Symmetry and Pattern:** We see a total of four aromatic protons (2H + 2H = 4H). These protons are split into two distinct groups of two protons each. Both signals are doublets (d). This simple A₂B₂ pattern (often appearing as two doublets) is a classic indicator of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para isomer means there are only two types of aromatic protons.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The substitution pattern on the benzene ring is *para*.\n    *   This result directly supports **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, which has a para-substitution pattern.\n    *   This result rules out **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**, which has an *ortho*-substitution pattern. An ortho-substituted ring would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets).\n    *   This also rules out **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**, which is trisubstituted and would only have three aromatic protons with a different, more complex splitting pattern.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion:**\nBy synthesizing the information from all three spectroscopic techniques:\n*   MS indicates a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   IR indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and shows a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nThe only structure among the choices that fits all of these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
