    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    *   The substituents are: ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2).\n    *   The substitution pattern is 1,2,3 (meaning all three groups are adjacent on the benzene ring).\n    *   Let's establish the relative positions based on IUPAC naming:\n        *   C1: -OEt (ethoxy)\n        *   C2: -tBu (tert-butyl)\n        *   C3: -NO2 (nitro)\n    *   Relationships between groups:\n        *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n        *   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n        *   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    This is crucial for planning the order of electrophilic aromatic substitutions.\n    *   **-OEt (Alkoxy):** Strong activating group, ortho-, para- director.\n    *   **-tBu (Alkyl):** Activating group, ortho-, para- director. It's very bulky, which can sterically hinder ortho positions.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strong deactivating group, meta- director.\n    *   **-NH2 (Amino):** Strong activating group, ortho-, para- director. It is often formed by reducing a -NO2 group. In strong acid (like nitrating mixture), it protonates to -NH3+, which becomes a deactivating, meta- director.\n    *   **-OH (Hydroxy):** Strong activating group, ortho-, para- director. The -OEt group is usually introduced at the end by reacting a phenol (-OH) with an ethyl halide (e.g., NaOH/EtBr, Williamson Ether Synthesis). This is a likely final step.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Options Systematically:**\n    All options start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene.\n    *   **Step i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** This is the common first step in all options.\n\n    Now, let's analyze the path for each option. The goal is to find a sequence that correctly places the groups in the 1,2,3 pattern and is described as \"high-yield\".\n\n    *   **Path A, C, D Evaluation:** A quick check of these options reveals chemically nonsensical steps.\n        *   **Option A**: Step (iv) calls for NaNO2/HCl (a diazotization reagent) to be used on a sulfonic acid intermediate (from step iii). Diazotization requires an amino group (-NH2). This is incorrect.\n        *   **Option C**: Step (vi) calls for SO3/H2SO4 to be used on a diazonium salt. This is not a standard or logical reaction in this context.\n        *   **Option D**: Step (vi) calls for HNO3/H2SO4 to be used on a diazonium salt. This is also chemically incorrect.\n        *   Since options A, C, and D contain steps that are not chemically sound, they are highly unlikely to be correct.\n\n    *   **Detailed Evaluation of Option B:** This option appears to be the most chemically plausible sequence, so let's analyze it step-by-step.\n        i.  **Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.**\n        ii. **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para product is major due to less steric hindrance. The problem asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which usually implies taking the major product. However, as we saw with other options, it's possible this assumption needs to be challenged. Let's trace the synthesis assuming we proceed with the **minor ortho isomer** (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene), as the final product requires the tBu and NO2 groups to be ortho. This is a potential low-yield step, but it's the only way to get the correct relative positioning.\n        iii. **Reduction (Fe/HCl):** The nitro group (-NO2) is reduced to an amino group (-NH2). We now have o-tert-butylaniline (1-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzene).\n        iv. **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** We now nitrate o-tert-butylaniline. The directing effects are from -NH2 (at C2) and -tBu (at C1). In strong acid, -NH2 becomes -NH3+, a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director.\n            *   -tBu at C1 directs to C3 (ortho) and C5 (ortho).\n            *   -NH3+ at C2 directs to C4 (meta) and C6 (meta).\n            *   The activating -tBu group is a stronger director than the deactivating -NH3+ group. It will preferentially direct the incoming electrophile (-NO2) to positions C3 and C5. To get our target product, we need the new -NO2 group at C3. This leads to 1-tert-butyl-2-amino-3-nitrobenzene (IUPAC name: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline). This step gives the desired regiochemistry.\n        v.  **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** The amino group (-NH2) is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+). We have 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenyldiazonium salt.\n        vi. **Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to replace the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This produces 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n        vii. **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. The -OH group is converted to an -OEt group. This yields 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene, which is exactly the target molecule.\n        viii. **SO3/H2SO4** and ix. **dilute H2SO4:** These last two steps are sulfonation followed by desulfonation. They would not result in a net change and seem superfluous to the synthesis, possibly added to make the option list longer or as a distractor. The core synthesis is completed at step vii.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Despite a potential low-yield step (step ii), the sequence of reactions in option B is the only one that is chemically logical and leads to the desired final product. The other options contain fundamentally incorrect chemical steps. Therefore, Option B represents the correct pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>"
