    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   We first calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of ~1720 cm-1 is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly an aryl ester (an ester group attached to a benzene ring). It is too high for a simple amide and too low for a phenyl ester where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This is a triplet integrating to 3 protons. This indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is a quartet integrating to 2 protons. This indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) means the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester linkage (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. This signal, in combination with the IR data, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH2)** protons. The signal is broad due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two different chemical shifts mean the two substituents on the ring are electronically different. The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) corresponds to protons ortho (adjacent) to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester). The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) corresponds to protons ortho to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    1.  We have a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n    2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n    3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**.\n    4.  Combining these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Checking the Alternatives**\n    *   A) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: Matches all data.\n    *   B) **N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: Is a secondary amide (not primary amine) and has an ether linkage. Would not match IR or NMR.\n    *   C) **4-aminophenyl propionate**: The ester is H2N-Ph-O-CO-CH2CH3. The NMR signal for the -CH2- group next to the C=O would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   D) **3-ethoxybenzamide**: Is meta-substituted (not para), so the aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex. Also, it's a primary amide, and the IR C=O stretch is typically lower than 1720 cm-1.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
