    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the interactions between the genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n**1. Analyze the phenotypes of the single-gene knockouts:**\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance (baseline).\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. Knocking out G1 causes a 25% loss in resistance. This means G1 positively contributes to resistance, but it's not absolutely essential.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. Knocking out G2 completely abolishes resistance. This indicates that G2 plays an essential or critical role in the resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. Knocking out G3 causes a 50% loss in resistance. This means G3 also positively contributes to resistance, and its role is more significant than G1's.\n\n**2. Analyze the phenotypes of the double-gene knockouts to determine genetic interactions (epistasis, redundancy, etc.):**\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n    *   The phenotype of the `g1g2` double mutant (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant (0%) and not the `g1` mutant (75%).\n    *   This is the definition of **epistasis**. When the phenotype of a double mutant matches the phenotype of one of the single mutants, that gene is said to be \"epistatic\" to the other. Here, the `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g1` mutation.\n    *   Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This suggests G2 acts downstream of G1, or G2 is in an essential pathway parallel to G1's pathway.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n    *   Similarly, the phenotype of the `g2g3` double mutant (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant (0%) and not the `g3` mutant (50%).\n    *   Therefore, **G2 is also epistatic to G3**.\n    *   The fact that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 places it at a crucial point in the pathway, likely downstream of both or in a parallel pathway that is absolutely required for any resistance.\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance.\n    *   Let's compare this to the single mutants. `g1` has 75% resistance, and `g3` has 50%.\n    *   If the genes were in a simple linear pathway, the double mutant would show the phenotype of the upstream gene knockout. This is not the case.\n    *   If their effects were simply additive (i.e., they are in independent pathways), the expected resistance would be 100% - (25% loss from g1 + 50% loss from g3) = 25%.\n    *   The observed resistance of 10% is much lower than the resistance of either single mutant and lower than the expected additive effect (25%). This much more severe phenotype in the double mutant is called **synergistic interaction** or **synthetic enhancement**. This strongly implies that G1 and G3 have **redundant or overlapping functions**. They operate in parallel, and the cell can partially compensate when one is missing, but losing both is catastrophic for resistance.\n\n**3. Determine which gene is the transcription factor.**\n*   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) that acts upstream of another. A TF regulates the expression of its target genes. If a TF is knocked out, its target genes will not be expressed.\n*   Consider the hypothesis that **G2 is the transcription factor**. If G2 activates both G1 and G3, a `g2` knockout would be functionally equivalent to a `g1g3` double knockout.\n    *   Phenotype of `g2` mutant = 0% resistance.\n    *   Phenotype of `g1g3` mutant = 10% resistance.\n    *   These two values are extremely similar (total or near-total loss of resistance). The minor difference (10%) can be attributed to factors like leaky gene expression. This provides strong support for the idea that **G2 is a transcription factor that regulates G1 and G3**.\n*   Let's quickly check other possibilities. If G1 were the TF for G2 and G3, the `g1` phenotype (75%) should match the `g2g3` phenotype (0%). This is a poor match. If G3 were the TF, the `g3` phenotype (50%) should match the `g1g2` phenotype (0%). This is also a poor match.\n\n**4. Synthesize the conclusions and evaluate the options.**\n\n*   **Conclusion 1:** G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. This is best explained by G2 being essential and acting downstream in the pathway (e.g., G1 and G3 are involved in activating G2, or G1, G3, and G2 are in a linear pathway with G2 at the end).\n*   **Conclusion 2:** G1 and G3 show synergistic interaction, which points to **gene redundancy**.\n*   **Conclusion 3:** G2 is the most likely candidate for the **transcription factor**, acting upstream of G1 and G3. This contradicts the downstream placement from Conclusion 1.\n\n*   **Resolving the contradiction:** How can G2 be a TF acting upstream of G1/G3, and also be epistatic (implying a downstream role)? The epistasis rule holds regardless of the specific biochemical mechanism. The total loss of resistance in any mutant containing `g2` means the G2 product is absolutely essential. The similarity of the `g2` and `g1g3` phenotypes strongly supports G2 as an upstream regulator of G1 and G3. We must prioritize this strong evidence. The apparent contradiction is resolved because being an \"upstream\" TF results in a phenotype (`g2` mutant) that masks the phenotypes of its \"downstream\" targets (`g1` and `g3` mutants), which is the definition of epistasis.\n\n**Final check of options based on our findings:**\n*   G2 is very likely the transcription factor.\n*   G1 and G3 exhibit gene redundancy.\n*   There is no epistasis between G1 and G3; their interaction is synergistic.\n\nLet's re-examine the options:\nA) G1 is a transcription factor (Incorrect), G2 and G3 show pleiotropy (Uncertain), G2 is epistatic towards G1 (Correct).\nB) G2 is a transcription factor (Correct), G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (Uncertain), G1 is epistatic towards G3 (Incorrect).\nC) G2 is a transcription factor (Correct), G1 and G3 has the same promoter (Possible hypothesis), G3 is epistatic towards G1 (Incorrect).\nD) G2 is a transcription factor (Correct), G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (Correct), G1 is epistatic towards G3 (Incorrect).\n\nOption D correctly identifies two of the key relationships we deduced from the data: \"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.\" The third statement, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is incorrect based on our analysis (the interaction is synergistic). However, compared to the other options which each contain at most one correct statement and at least one incorrect statement, Option D is the best and most comprehensive description of the genetic network, despite having one incorrect clause (likely a mistake in the question itself).\n\n<<<D>>>"
