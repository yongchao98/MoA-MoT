    "This problem requires us to determine the momentum of a photon needed to excite a diatomic molecule from its ground state to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model.\n\n### **1. Reasoning and Derivations**\n\n**Step 1: Define the Energy Levels**\nThe energy of a state in the rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\nE(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = (v + 1/2) * ħ * ω + B * J * (J + 1)\n\nwhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2 * I)\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia, defined as I = μ * R²\n*   `μ` is the reduced mass, defined as μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Ground State**\nThe ground state is the state with the minimum possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers `v` and `J` are at their lowest values, which are v=0 and J=0.\nE_ground = E(v=0, J=0) = (0 + 1/2) * ħ * ω + B * 0 * (1) = (1/2) * ħ * ω\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Next Lowest Energy State**\nTo find the next state, we need to find the transition that requires the smallest amount of energy (ΔE). We have two possibilities for the first excitation:\n1.  **Vibrational Excitation:** Transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0).\n    ΔE_vib = E(1,0) - E(0,0) = [(3/2)ħω] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω\n2.  **Rotational Excitation:** Transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1). (Note: for photon absorption, the selection rule is ΔJ = +1).\n    ΔE_rot = E(0,1) - E(0,0) = [(1/2)ħω + B*1*(2)] - [(1/2)ħω] = 2B\n\nTypically, rotational energy level spacings are much smaller than vibrational ones. We will calculate both to confirm, which requires calculating the rotational constant `B`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Numerical Values**\nWe need to calculate `B` to find `ΔE_rot`. This involves finding the reduced mass `μ` and the moment of inertia `I`.\n\n*   **Given Data:**\n    *   Mx = 20 amu\n    *   My = 2 amu\n    *   R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   amu to kg: 1 amu = 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    *   `c` (speed of light) = 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `ħ` = 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n*   **Calculation:** We will use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants ---\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34      # J*s (reduced Planck constant)\namu_to_kg = 1.66053906660e-27 # kg/amu\nc = 299792458                # m/s (speed of light)\n\n# --- Given values ---\nMx_amu = 20.0  # amu\nMy_amu = 2.0   # amu\nR = 2.0e-10    # m (2 angstroms)\nw = 4.0e14     # rad/s\n\n# 1.

This matches option D.\n\nThe energy for the first rotational transition is ΔE_rot ≈ 5.56 x 10⁻²³ J.\nThe energy for the first vibrational transition is ΔE_vib ≈ 4.22 x 10⁻²⁰ J.\nSince ΔE_rot is significantly smaller than ΔE_vib, the next state with the lowest possible energy is indeed the first rotational state (v=0, J=1). The energy required for this transition corresponds to the absorbed photon's energy, which we use to find its momentum.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1.

This requires an energy of `ΔE = 2B`.\n    *   **Contextual Interpretation:** Often in spectroscopy, problems distinguish between pure rotational spectra (microwave region) and rovibrational spectra (infrared region). The lowest-energy *rovibrational* transition allowed by selection rules (`Δv = +1`, `ΔJ = ±1`) starting from `J=0` is the transition to the `(v=1, J=1)` state. This requires an energy of `ΔE = ħω + 2B`.\n\nWe will calculate the energy for the contextual interpretation, as it is a common type of transition studied and is likely what is intended if the literal interpretation does not yield a matching answer.\n\nThe transition is `(v=0, J=0) -> (v=1, J=1)`.\n`E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B*1*(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n\n**Step 3: Photon Energy and Momentum**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (`E_photon`) must equal the change in the molecule's energy (`ΔE`):\n`E_photon = ΔE = E_final - E_initial`\n`ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + 2B`\n\nThe momentum of a photon (`p`) is related to its energy by `E_photon = p * c`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n`p = ΔE / c = (ħω + 2B) / c`\n\n**Step 4: Calculation**\n\nWe need to calculate `μ`, `I`, `B`, and then `p`.

    "### **1. Reasoning and Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem asks for the momentum of a photon required to excite a diatomic molecule from its ground state to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is described by the non-rigid rotor model (quantum rotation-vibration model).\n\n**Step 1: Define the Energy Levels**\nThe energy `E(v, J)` of a specific state in this model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\nE(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = (v + 1/2) * ħ * ω + B * J * (J + 1)\n\nwhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as `B = ħ² / (2 * I)`.\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia, `I = μ * R²`.\n*   `μ` is the reduced mass, `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Initial and Final States**\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state where both energy contributions are minimal.

The absolute lowest energy excitation, which would be a purely rotational transition to `(v=0, J=1)`. The energy for this is `2B`.\n    2.  The lowest-energy *rovibrational* transition. Since the problem provides the vibrational frequency `ω`, it strongly implies that a change in the vibrational state `v` is involved. For photon absorption, the selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`. Starting from `J=0`, the only allowed transition is `ΔJ = +1`.\n\n    Therefore, the most likely intended transition is the rovibrational jump from `(v=0, J=0)` to `(v=1, J=1)`.

    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **1. Reasoning and Derivations**\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physical Model**\nThe problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule. The energy of a specific quantum state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J`, is given by:\nE(v, J) = (v + 1/2) * ħ * ω + B * J * (J + 1)\n\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `ω` is the vibrational angular frequency.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Initial and Final States**\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule starts in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are zero: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule is excited by absorbing a single photon to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This requires interpreting what transition requires the minimum energy. There are two main types of transitions from the ground state:\n    1.  **Purely Rotational:** (v=0, J=0) → (v=0, J=1). Energy change is `2B`.\n    2.  **Rovibrational:** (v=0, J=0) → (v=1, J=1). Energy change is `ħω + 2B`. (Selection rules Δv=+1, ΔJ=+1 are applied).\n\nSince the problem provides the vibrational frequency `ω`, it strongly implies that a vibrational transition is intended to be part of the solution. If it were a purely rotational problem, providing `ω` would be unnecessary. Therefore, we assume the transition is rovibrational.\n\nThe final state is `(v=1, J=1)`.\nE_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B * 1 * (1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Photon Energy and Momentum**\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (`E_photon`) must equal the change in the molecule's energy (`ΔE`).\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\nΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n\nThe momentum of a photon (`p`) is related to its energy by `E_photon = p * c`, where `c` is the speed of light. Thus:\np = ΔE / c = (ħω + 2B) / c\n\nTo find `p`, we must first calculate the rotational constant `B`, which depends on the moment of inertia (`I`) and the reduced mass (`μ`).\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculations**\nWe will use a Python script to ensure accuracy. The steps are:\n1.  Calculate the reduced mass `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`.\n2.  Calculate the moment of inertia `I = μ * R²`.\n3.  Calculate the rotational constant `B = ħ² / (2I)`.\n4.
