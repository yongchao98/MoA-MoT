    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the experimental data from the gas treatment**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight did not change, it means no CO₂ (or other acidic gases like SO₂) was produced during the decomposition. This implies the salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This increase is purely due to the mass of oxygen atoms from an oxidizing gas in the mixture.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the reagents used.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Determine the composition of the initial gas mixture**\n\nFrom step 1, we know the initial salts decomposed to produce a mixture of gases containing H₂O, N₂, and an oxidizing gas containing nitrogen and/or oxygen. Let's determine the identity and quantity of the oxidizing gas.\n\n*   The oxidizing gas contains 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms. Plausible candidates from the decomposition of nitrogen-based salts include O₂, N₂O, or NO.\n*   The temperature of decomposition is 200°C. This is a key piece of information for identifying the likely decomposition products of common salts.\n*   Let's consider the common thermal decomposition of ammonium salts:\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O (This reaction occurs between 170°C and 240°C).\n    *   At higher temperatures (>250°C), NH₄NO₃ can decompose differently: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O.\n*   Given the temperature of 200°C, the formation of N₂O from ammonium nitrate is the most likely reaction. This suggests our oxidizing gas is N₂O.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n*   If the oxidizing gas is nitrous oxide (N₂O), we need 0.05 mol of N₂O to provide 0.05 mol of O atoms.\n*   The reaction in tube №3 with hot copper is: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂.\n*   This means 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted, producing 0.05 mol of N₂ gas inside tube №3.\n*   The final collected gas (Gas C) is 0.10 mol of N₂. This gas consists of any N₂ that entered tube №3 plus the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction.\n    *   Total N₂ = (N₂ that entered) + (N₂ produced from N₂O)\n    *   0.10 mol = (N₂ that entered) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Solving for the amount of N₂ that entered, we get: (N₂ that entered) = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was:\n*   **0.20 mol H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol N₂O** (the oxidizing gas)\n*   **0.05 mol N₂** (the initial inert gas)\n\n### **3. Verify with Mass Conservation and Identify Salts A and B**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of these gaseous products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H₂O = 0.20 mol * 18.0 g/mol = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.05 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 1.40 g\n*   **Total mass = 3.60 g + 2.20 g + 1.40 g = 7.20 g.**\nThis perfectly matches the initial mass. Our identification of the product mixture is correct.\n\nNow, we must find two salts, A and B, which are in an equimolar mixture and decompose to give this specific set of products.\n*   The products 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.2 mol H₂O (0.1 mol H₂O from each source) correspond perfectly to the decomposition of:\n    *   **0.05 mol of Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):**\n        0.05 NH₄NO₂(s) → 0.05 N₂(g) + 0.1 H₂O(g)\n    *   **0.05 mol of Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):**\n        0.05 NH₄NO₃(s) → 0.05 N₂O(g) + 0.1 H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states an equimolar mixture (0.05 mol of each) was used. This scenario fits all the data. Therefore:\n*   **Salt A is NH₄NO₂**\n*   **Salt B is NH₄NO₃**\n\n### **4. Calculate the total number of atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in salts A and B** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
