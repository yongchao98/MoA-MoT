    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on experimental observations. Let's break down the information provided:\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (the antigen) tagged with GFP are delivered orally.\n2.  **Antigen Journey:** The proteins travel through the GI tract, with some loss, but some successfully reach secondary lymphoid organs.\n3.  **Site of Action:** Fluorescence is seen in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a type of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which are secondary lymphoid organs critical for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens. This indicates the antigen has been taken up and is being processed in these immune centers.\n4.  **Cellular Response:** A proliferating cell population is isolated from these patches. Proliferation of lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) is a key feature of an adaptive immune response upon encountering an antigen.\n5.  **Genetic Observation:** Sequencing of the variable heavy chain gene from these proliferating cells shows *high variability*. The variable heavy chain is part of the B cell receptor (and the antibody it will secrete). The proliferating cells are therefore identified as B cells. The key question is what process introduces high variability into the variable region of an antibody *during* an active immune response in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system and the humoral arm of the adaptive immune system. It involves a cascade of plasma proteins that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve any genetic changes in lymphocytes.\n*   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism by which the immune system adapts to new foreign elements. It occurs in activated B cells in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). The process, driven by the enzyme AID (Activation-Induced Deaminase), introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different B cell receptors. Those with higher affinity for the antigen are selected to survive and proliferate (a process called affinity maturation). This directly results in *high variability* in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating B cell population. This perfectly matches the experimental observation.\n*   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, which switches the antibody class (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA). This process alters the effector function of the antibody but does *not* affect the variable region, and thus does not change antigen specificity or create variability there.\n*   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the genetic recombination that occurs in *developing* B cells (and T cells) in the *primary* lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells). It is responsible for creating the initial, vast repertoire of antigen receptors *before* any encounter with an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in a *mature* B cell population responding to a specific antigen in a *secondary* lymphoid organ, not the initial generation of diversity in the bone marrow.\n\nConclusion: The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating B cells within a Peyer's patch, following antigen exposure, is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
