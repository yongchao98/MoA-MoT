    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 3-methylpent-1-ene. Its structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The carbon at position 3 (C3) is a chiral center. The problem states the reactant is \"racemic,\" which means it is a 50:50 mixture of the (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene enantiomers. Let's call them R-alkene and S-alkene.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is carried out with Grubbs catalyst, which is a standard catalyst for olefin metathesis. Since there is only one type of alkene, it will undergo self-metathesis.\n\n2.  **Determine the Primary Metathesis Product:**\n    *   The general reaction for self-metathesis of a terminal alkene (R'-CH=CH₂) is:\n        `2 R'-CH=CH₂  -->  R'-CH=CH-R'  +  CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)`\n    *   In our case, the `R'` group is the chiral sec-butyl group, `CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   The reaction is:\n        `2 [CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃]-CH=CH₂  -->  [CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃]-CH=CH-[CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃]  +  ethene`\n    *   The question asks to exclude ethene. The main product is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The product molecule, 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, has two chiral centers at C3 and C6. These are the chiral centers from the original reactant molecules.\n    *   The newly formed double bond at C4 can be either E (trans) or Z (cis). Both are possible products.\n\n4.  **Consider the Reactions Between Enantiomers:**\n    Since the starting material is a racemic mixture of R-alkene and S-alkene, three types of pairings can occur during the dimerization reaction:\n    *   **Reaction 1: R-alkene + R-alkene**\n    *   **Reaction 2: S-alkene + S-alkene**\n    *   **Reaction 3: R-alkene + S-alkene**\n\n5.  **Analyze the Products from Each Pairing:**\n\n    *   **From R-alkene + R-alkene:**\n        This pairing will result in a product where both chiral centers have the (R) configuration: (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Since the double bond can be E or Z, two products are formed:\n        *   (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n        *   (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n        These products are chiral.\n\n    *   **From S-alkene + S-alkene:**\n        This pairing will result in a product where both chiral centers have the (S) configuration: (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Again, considering E/Z isomerism:\n        *   (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n        *   (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n        These products are also chiral. The (3S,6S) products are the enantiomers of the (3R,6R) products. Since the starting material is racemic and the catalyst is achiral, the (R,R) and (S,S) products will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in two racemic mixtures.\n\n    *   **From R-alkene + S-alkene:**\n        This cross-pairing results in a product with both (R) and (S) configurations: (3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Because the two chiral centers `(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃)` are identical, the (R,S) combination results in a meso compound (an achiral molecule with chiral centers due to internal symmetry). This also exists as E and Z isomers:\n        *   (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n        *   (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n        These two meso compounds are diastereomers of each other and of the chiral products.\n\n6.  **Count the Number of Possible Products:**\n    The question \"How many possible products\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n    a) The total number of distinct stereoisomeric molecules.\n    b) The number of diastereomerically distinct products (i.e., separable fractions by achiral methods, where a racemic pair is counted as one product).\n\n    *   **Interpretation (a):** Counting every single unique stereoisomer:\n        1.  (E)-(3R,6R)\n        2.  (E)-(3S,6S)\n        3.  (Z)-(3R,6R)\n        4.  (Z)-(3S,6S)\n        5.  (E)-(3R,6S) meso\n        6.  (Z)-(3R,6S) meso\n        This gives a total of **6** distinct molecular products.\n\n    *   **Interpretation (b):** Counting the products based on how they would behave as a mixture. The mixture formed contains:\n        1.  A racemic mixture of the E-isomers: `rac-[(E)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene]`, which is {(E,3R,6R) + (E,3S,6S)}.\n        2.  A racemic mixture of the Z-isomers: `rac-[(Z)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene]`, which is {(Z,3R,6R) + (Z,3S,6S)}.\n        3.  The E-meso compound: `(E,3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene`.\n        4.  The Z-meso compound: `(Z,3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene`.\n        These four are all diastereomers of one another and could, in principle, be separated by techniques like distillation or standard chromatography. In this common and practical view, the reaction produces **4** products.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Given the multiple-choice format, the question is likely testing the more nuanced understanding of how a racemic reactant leads to a mixture composed of diastereomeric racemates and meso compounds. This interpretation leads to 4 distinct products in a practical, chemical sense.\n\nFinal list of products (diastereomerically distinct):\n1.  racemic (E)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n2.  racemic (Z)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n3.  meso (E)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n4.  meso (Z)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n\nThus, there are 4 possible products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
