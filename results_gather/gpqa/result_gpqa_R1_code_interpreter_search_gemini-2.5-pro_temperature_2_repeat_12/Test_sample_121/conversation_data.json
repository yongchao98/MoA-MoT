    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Synthesis Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), Bromine (Br₂), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which causes the halogenation of the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Product 1:** Acetic acid's α-carbon is the methyl carbon. The product is α-bromoacetic acid.\n    *   **Structure 1:** Br-CH₂-COOH\n\n2.  **Step 2: 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).\n    *   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   **Structure 2:** Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃\n\n3.  **Step 3: 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the α-carbon.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   **Structure 3:** NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃\n\n4.  **Step 4: 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   **Reactant 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a multi-step process analogous to the malonic ester synthesis for forming rings.\n        a.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. The acidity is enhanced by the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt).\n        b.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        c.  **Second Deprotonation:** The intermediate product still has one acidic α-proton. The \"excess\" NaH deprotonates this α-carbon again.\n        d.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring. The ring is formed from the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n    *   **Structure 4:**\n        ```\n               COOCH₂CH₃\n               |\n           CN--C\n             /   \\\n          H₂C     CH₂\n          |       |\n          H₂C     CH₂\n            \\   /\n             CH₂\n        ```\n\n### ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogen signals. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the stereochemical relationship between its protons (stereotopicity).\n\nThe molecule is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This results in a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C1 (the carbon with CN and COOEt), C4, and the substituents on C1.\n\nLet's analyze the signals from each part of the molecule based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃ protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂- protons:** The carbon C1 of the ring is a prochiral center (it is bonded to four different groups in a stereochemical sense: -CN, -COOEt, -C2H2-, and -C6H2-, where the paths around the ring are equivalent). Methylene protons adjacent to a prochiral center are **diastereotopic**. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and give rise to distinct signals. Therefore, the two methylene protons will produce **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons equivalent (C2=C6 and C3=C5), but we must consider the protons on them separately.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The positions C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, the two geminal protons (one 'axial-like' and one 'equatorial-like' in the average conformation) are **diastereotopic**. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Therefore, these four protons give rise to **2 signals** (one for the two equivalent 'a-type' protons on C2/C6, and one for the two equivalent 'b-type' protons on C2/C6).\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The logic is the same as for C2/C6. The positions are equivalent by symmetry, but the geminal protons on each carbon are **diastereotopic**. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Reflection through this plane interchanges the two geminal protons. This makes them **enantiotopic**. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and thus give a single signal. This results in **1 signal** for these two protons.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSumming up the distinct signals:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH₃) + 2 (for -OCH₂-) = 3 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (for C2/C6) + 2 (for C3/C5) + 1 (for C4) = 5 signals\n\n**Total number of distinct hydrogen signals = 3 + 5 = 8.**\n\n<<<C>>>"
