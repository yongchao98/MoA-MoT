    "**1. Deconstruct the Provided Data**\n\nThe problem asks to identify the final product of a reaction. To do this, we must first identify the starting material, Compound X, using the given Infrared (IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra, and then determine how it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad peak):** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong peak):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are in the region for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze the signals one by one to piece together the structure.\n\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet integrating to one proton, located far downfield. This is the classic chemical shift for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Having two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicates a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The protons giving the signal at 8.0 ppm are *ortho* to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH group), which deshields them. The protons at 7.2 ppm are *ortho* to an electron-donating group (the alkyl substituent).\n*   **Analysis of the Alkyl Substituent (total C4H9):**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Fragment: **-CH₂-CH₃**.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). Fragment: **-CH-CH₃**.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from our first fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the -CH₃ group (3 protons) and the methine (-CH-) group (1 proton).\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is benzylic (attached directly to the aromatic ring). It is a multiplet because it's coupled to the -CH₃ group (3 protons) and the -CH₂- group (2 protons).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring with a -COOH group on one side.\n    *   The other substituent is an alkyl group assembled from the fragments: `Ar-CH-` + `-CH₂-CH₃` + `-CH₃`.\n    *   Connecting them logically based on the splitting patterns gives: `Ar-CH(-CH₃)(-CH₂CH₃)`.\n    *   This group is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   Therefore, the full structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**4. The Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Compound X) and Red Phosphorus + HI.\n*   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and hydriodic acid (HI) is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carbonyl functional groups, including those in carboxylic acids, to alkanes (CH₂ or CH₃).\n\n**5. Predicting the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The rest of the molecule, the aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group, will remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reduction of -COOH group:** -COOH → -CH₃\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene, which is also named **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**6. Matching with Options**\n\nLet's compare our predicted product with the given choices:\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl group (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, Compound X, not the final product.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
