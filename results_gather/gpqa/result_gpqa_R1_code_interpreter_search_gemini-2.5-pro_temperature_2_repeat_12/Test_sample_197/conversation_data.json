    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:** In a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ligands, several complexation equilibria occur. The cobalt-containing species are the free hydrated ion Co²⁺ and a series of complexes: [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n\n2.  **Use the overall stability constants (βn):** The formation of these complexes from the free metal ion and ligands is described by the overall stability constants:\n    *   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺      ; β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n    *   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]     ; β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n    *   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻    ; β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n    *   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻   ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n3.  **Define the total cobalt concentration (c(Co) or C_T):** The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species.\n    *   C_T = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n4.  **Express each species' concentration in terms of [Co²⁺]:** Using the stability constant expressions, we can write the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺] and the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻].\n    *   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n5.  **Substitute into the total concentration equation:**\n    *   C_T = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n    *   Factor out [Co²⁺]: C_T = [Co²⁺] (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n6.  **Calculate the fraction of the desired species:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]. The fraction of this species (let's call it α₂) is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration.\n    *   α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / C_T\n    *   α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\n7.  **Simplify the expression for α₂:** The [Co²⁺] term cancels out from the numerator and denominator. This means the fraction of each species depends only on the free ligand concentration, [SCN⁻], not on the total metal concentration.\n    *   α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n8.  **Plug in the given values:**\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    We will use a short Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Stability constants\nb1 = 9\nb2 = 40\nb3 = 63\nb4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration\nL = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = b1 * L\nterm2 = b2 * L**2\nterm3 = b3 * L**3\nterm4 = b4 * L**4\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms, representing the relative total concentration.\ndenominator_sum = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the species of interest, [Co(SCN)2].\nnumerator = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator_sum\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f'{percentage=}')\n```\n<execute_result>\npercentage=16.916180326482276\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the fraction of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is approximately 0.169, which corresponds to 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Identify the relevant chemical equilibria:**\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions react with thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ligands to form a series of complexes:\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (β):\n*   β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n*   β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n*   β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n*   β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n**2. Define the distribution coefficient (α):**\nThe fraction (or distribution coefficient, α) of any single cobalt species is its concentration divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species, c(Co). We are interested in α₂ for the [Co(SCN)₂] complex.\n\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**3. Express all concentrations in terms of [Co²⁺]:**\nUsing the stability constants, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the free ligand concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**4. Derive the formula for α₂:**\nSubstitute these expressions into the equations for c(Co) and α₂:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term appears in both the numerator and every term of the denominator, so it can be cancelled out:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThis shows that the fraction of each species depends only on the free ligand concentration, [SCN⁻], which is given as 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not needed for this part of the calculation.\n\n**5. Calculate the result:**\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nDenominator = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nDenominator = 2.3646\n\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**6. Convert to percentage:**\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = α₂ × 100% = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution.\n\n<<<D>>>"
