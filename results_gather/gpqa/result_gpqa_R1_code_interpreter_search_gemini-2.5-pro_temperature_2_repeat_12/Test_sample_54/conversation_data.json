    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, which means these three protons have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal strongly indicates the presence of an acetyl group (CH3COO-). All four possible options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical shift for an allylic or vinylic methyl group (a CH3 group attached to a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, meaning this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This indicates a CH3-CH= fragment.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinyl) region, typical for a proton on a C=C double bond.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The \"d\" (doublet) indicates it is coupled to one proton. The \"q\" (quartet) indicates it is coupled to three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confirms the CH3-CH=CH- fragment. This proton is the one in the middle (=CH-), coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton (creating the doublet) and the adjacent methyl group (creating the quartet).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal also represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a vinyl proton. This strong deshielding effect is caused by an adjacent electronegative atom, in this case, the oxygen of the acetate group. So, this proton is part of a C=CH-O fragment.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** It is coupled to one adjacent proton (the one at 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining stereochemistry. For protons across a double bond (vicinal coupling), a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) indicates a **trans** configuration. A smaller J value (6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* configuration.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options:**\n\n*   **Fragments Identified:** We have an acetate group (CH3COO-), and a propenyl group (CH3-CH=CH-). The linkage is confirmed by the proton at 7.0 ppm being attached to the oxygen. The full structure is **CH3-CH=CH-O-COCH3**. This is named **propenyl acetate** (specifically, prop-1-en-1-yl acetate).\n*   This rules out **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**, as those molecules would contain a four-carbon butenyl group and would produce a different NMR spectrum. For instance, a butenyl group would introduce additional protons (e.g., from an ethyl group or a methylene group) that are not seen in the provided data.\n*   **Determine Stereochemistry:** The decision is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The coupling constant between the two vinyl protons (the ones at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) is given as **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely in the range for a **trans** relationship.\n*   **Final Conclusion:** The compound has a propenyl acetate structure with a trans configuration at the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's visualize the final compound and its protons to confirm:\n\n```\n      H(c)   O\n       \\    /\n        C = C      (Trans configuration)\n       /    \\\n H(b)-C-H(d)  H(a)\n    |\n   H(b)\n```\n*   **H(a) (proton at 7.0 ppm):** Vinyl proton next to oxygen. Split into a doublet by H(d). J = 16.0 Hz (trans coupling).\n*   **H(d) (proton at 5.5 ppm):** Vinyl proton next to the methyl group. Split into a doublet by H(a) (J = 16.0 Hz) and a quartet by the three H(b) protons (J ~ 7 Hz). This makes it a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   **H(b) (protons at 1.6 ppm):** Methyl group protons. Split into a doublet by H(d) (J ~ 7 Hz).\n*   **H(c) (protons at 2.1 ppm):** Acetate methyl group protons. No adjacent protons, so it is a singlet.\n\nThe data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
