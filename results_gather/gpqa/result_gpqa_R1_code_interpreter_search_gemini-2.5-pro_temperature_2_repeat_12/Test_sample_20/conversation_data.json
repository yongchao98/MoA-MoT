    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical phenomenon where a compound exists in two or more interconvertible forms, called tautomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are part of the double bonds and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Since there are no α-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound is a cyclic tri-ketone. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons. Each of these α-carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These α-hydrogens are acidic and can move to the adjacent oxygen atom, converting the keto form into an enol form. In this specific case, the molecule can tautomerize to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and thus highly stable compound. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exhibits significant tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the carbon bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism (exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is a trans-alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar around the double bond. It does not have any chiral centers. Furthermore, it possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry are achiral and do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
