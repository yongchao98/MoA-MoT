    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism:**\n    A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The most common sources of chirality are:\n    1.  **Chiral center (asymmetric carbon):** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    2.  **Axial chirality (atropisomerism):** Chirality arising from hindered rotation around a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls.\n    3.  **Planar chirality:** Chirality arising from a plane that is part of a larger molecular structure.\n    4.  **Helicity:** Inherent chirality of a helix-shaped molecule.\n\n*   **Step-by-step analysis of the compounds:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are linked by a single bond. The ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are all substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n        *   **Chirality:** Due to the steric hindrance caused by these bulky ortho-substituents, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is prevented. This forces the rings to adopt a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation. In this conformation, the molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. This specific type of stereoisomerism is known as **atropisomerism**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n        *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the carbon attached to the -OH group). This carbon is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  a methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since this carbon atom is attached to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as R and S enantiomers).\n\n    3.  **benzophenone:**\n        *   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5 (diphenyl ketone).\n        *   **Chirality:** This molecule has no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid). The structure is trans-CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n        *   **Chirality:** This molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It possesses a **center of inversion** (also called a center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. It also has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Decision:**\n    *   Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 3 (benzophenone) does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    Therefore, the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
