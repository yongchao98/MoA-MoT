    "To determine the energy threshold at which high-energy gamma-rays ($\\gamma$) have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we need to analyze the pair production process: $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\nThis process is governed by the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum. Let the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray be $p_1 = (E_\\gamma/c, \\vec{p}_1)$ and the CMB photon be $p_2 = (E_{CMB}/c, \\vec{p}_2)$. The final state consists of an electron ($e^-$) and a positron ($e^+$), each with rest mass $m_e$.\n\nThe total four-momentum squared is a Lorentz invariant. We can equate this quantity in the laboratory frame (before the collision) and the center-of-mass frame (after the collision).\n\n**1. Before the collision (Lab Frame):**\nThe square of the total initial four-momentum is:\n$s = (p_1 + p_2)^2 = p_1^2 + p_2^2 + 2 p_1 \\cdot p_2$\n\nFor photons, the rest mass is zero, so their four-momentum squared is $p^2 = (E/c)^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 = 0$. Thus, $p_1^2 = 0$ and $p_2^2 = 0$.\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$s = 2 p_1 \\cdot p_2 = 2 \\left( \\frac{E_\\gamma E_{CMB}}{c^2} - \\vec{p}_1 \\cdot \\vec{p}_2 \\right)$\n\nSince photons have momentum $|\\vec{p}| = E/c$, the dot product of their three-momenta is $\\vec{p}_1 \\cdot \\vec{p}_2 = |\\vec{p}_1| |\\vec{p}_2| \\cos\\theta = \\frac{E_\\gamma E_{CMB}}{c^2} \\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two incoming photons.\n\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$s = \\frac{2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB}}{c^2} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**2. After the collision (Center-of-Mass Frame):**\nThe reaction threshold is the minimum energy required to create the electron-positron pair. At this threshold, the electron and positron are produced at rest in the center-of-mass frame.\nThe total energy in the center-of-mass frame is the sum of the rest energies of the electron and positron, which is $2m_e c^2$. The total momentum is zero.\nThe square of the total final four-momentum is:\n$s = \\left( \\frac{2m_e c^2}{c}, \\vec{0} \\right)^2 = (2m_e c)^2 = 4m_e^2 c^2$\n\n**3. Equating and Solving for Threshold Energy:**\nBy equating the two expressions for the invariant $s$, we have:\n$\\frac{2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB}}{c^2} (1 - \\cos\\theta) = 4m_e^2 c^2$\n$E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) = 2 (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nTo find the minimum energy $E_\\gamma$ required for the reaction, we need to consider the most energetically favorable collision, which is a head-on collision. In a head-on collision, the angle $\\theta = \\pi$ ($180^\\circ$), which maximizes the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ to $1 - (-1) = 2$. This configuration minimizes the required energy $E_\\gamma$ for a given $E_{CMB}$.\n\nAt the threshold:\n$E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (2) = 2 (m_e c^2)^2$\n$E_\\gamma E_{CMB} = (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nSolving for the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, $E_\\gamma$:\n$E_{\\gamma, \\text{threshold}} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3}$ eV.\n*   Rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 = 0.511$ MeV = $0.511 \\times 10^6$ eV.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n$E_{\\gamma, \\text{threshold}} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, \\text{threshold}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, \\text{threshold}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nTo express this result in Giga-electron Volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n$E_{\\gamma, \\text{threshold}} = 0.261121 \\times \\frac{10^{15}}{10^9} \\text{ GeV} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n$E_{\\gamma, \\text{threshold}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) $9.5 \\times 10^4$ GeV\nB) $1.8 \\times 10^5$ GeV\nC) $3.9 \\times 10^5$ GeV\nD) $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV\n\nOur calculated value of approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV matches option D. Gamma-rays with energies at or above this threshold will have their propagation distance significantly limited due to this pair-production interaction with the CMB, a phenomenon known as the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) limit for photons.\n\n<<<D>>>"
