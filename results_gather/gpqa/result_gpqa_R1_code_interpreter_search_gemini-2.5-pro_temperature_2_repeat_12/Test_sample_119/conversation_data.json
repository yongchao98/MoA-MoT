    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumptions:**\n    *   The stars are uniformly distributed in three-dimensional space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere.\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (assuming parallax is measured in arcseconds and distance in parsecs).\n\n2.  **Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars within a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from the observer.\n    *   Let the radius of this shell be `d` and its thickness be `Δd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`ΔV`) can be approximated as the surface area of the sphere times its thickness: `ΔV ≈ 4πd² * Δd`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`ΔN`) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell: `ΔN = ρ * ΔV = ρ * 4πd² * Δd`.\n    *   This equation tells us that the number of stars per unit distance range (`ΔN/Δd`) is proportional to `d²`: `ΔN/Δd ∝ d²`.\n\n3.  **Converting from Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   Our goal is to find the number of stars per unit *parallax* range (`ΔN/Δplx`), not the distance range. So, we need to express `d` and `Δd` in terms of `plx` and `Δplx`.\n    *   From `d = 1/plx`, we can relate the differential change in distance (`dd` or `Δd`) to the differential change in parallax (`d(plx)` or `Δplx`).\n    *   Using calculus, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`: `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`.\n    *   This means `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are concerned with the number of stars in a small positive range, we only care about the magnitude. So, `|Δd| ≈ (1/plx²) * |Δplx|`.\n\n4.  **Deriving the Final Relationship:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `Δd` in terms of `plx` back into our equation for `ΔN`:\n        `ΔN = ρ * 4πd² * Δd`\n        `ΔN ≈ ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * Δplx`\n    *   Simplifying this expression:\n        `ΔN ≈ ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * Δplx`\n    *   We want to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`ΔN/Δplx`) changes with `plx`. We can get this by dividing both sides by `Δplx`:\n        `ΔN/Δplx ≈ ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴)`\n    *   Since `ρ` (star density) and `4π` are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `ΔN/Δplx ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFor a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>"
