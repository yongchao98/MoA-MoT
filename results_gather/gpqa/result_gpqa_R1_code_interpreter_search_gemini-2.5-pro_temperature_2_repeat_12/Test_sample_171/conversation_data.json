    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct equation.\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) tells us that the distribution of atoms across these energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states (i and j) at a given temperature (T):\n    Nᵢ / Nⱼ = (gᵢ / gⱼ) * exp[-(Eᵢ - Eⱼ) / (k * T)]\n    Where:\n    *   Nᵢ, Nⱼ are the populations of the energy levels.\n    *   gᵢ, gⱼ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   Eᵢ - Eⱼ = ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.3806 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define \"Excitation\":** The term \"excited\" refers to the relative population of a higher energy level. We can express this as the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (let's call it Nₑ) to the number of atoms in the ground state (N₀).\n    For a given star:\n    Excitation = Nₑ / N₀ = (gₑ / g₀) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T)]\n    Here, ΔE represents the energy of the excited level relative to the ground state.\n\n4.  **Translate the problem statement into an equation:** The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the excitation ratio for star_1 is two times the excitation ratio for star_2.\n    (Nₑ / N₀)₁ = 2 * (Nₑ / N₀)₂\n\n5.  **Apply the Boltzmann equation to both stars:**\n    *   For star_1 (temperature T₁): (Nₑ / N₀)₁ = (gₑ / g₀) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]\n    *   For star_2 (temperature T₂): (Nₑ / N₀)₂ = (gₑ / g₀) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\n6.  **Substitute these expressions into the equation from step 4:**\n    (gₑ / g₀) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * (gₑ / g₀) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\n7.  **Simplify the equation:** The statistical weight factor (gₑ / g₀) is the same for both sides since it's the same energy level transition for the same atom (iron). Therefore, it cancels out.\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\n8.  **Isolate the factor of 2 by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:**\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)])\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(ab) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(eˣ) = x:\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + (-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\n9.  **Solve for ln(2):**\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n\n10. **Factor and simplify the expression:**\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\n11. **Evaluate the constant factor (ΔE / k):**\n    The problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    The Boltzmann constant k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n    The ratio is therefore:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K.\n    The units work out to Kelvin (J / (J/K) = K), but since the temperatures T are also in Kelvin, the factor effectively becomes 1 in the final expression.\n\n12. **Write the final equation:**\n    Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into the equation from step 10:\n    ln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n    ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
