    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I'll break down the provided information into key observations.\n    *   **Compound:** A small, chemically synthesized peptide. Peptides are polymers of amino acids, which (except for glycine) are chiral. This means stereochemistry is important.\n    *   **NMR Data:**\n        *   Observation: Two peaks for *one* specific alpha-proton.\n        *   Characteristic 1: Similar chemical shifts. This implies the two species are structurally very similar.\n        *   Characteristic 2: Roughly equal integrals, which sum to the expected 1H. This means the two species are present in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n        *   Ruled Out: Spin-spin coupling. This is a crucial piece of information. It means the splitting is not due to neighboring protons but because the proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   Condition: Analysis performed at an *elevated temperature*. This can sometimes cause interconverting species (like rotamers) to coalesce into a single peak, but not always, depending on the energy barrier and the timescale of the experiment.\n        *   Observation: Two clearly defined peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). This means there are two distinct chemical species that can be separated based on their physical properties (like polarity).\n        *   Characteristic 1: Equal intensities. This corroborates the NMR data, suggesting a ~1:1 mixture.\n        *   Characteristic 2: Both peaks have the *same mass spectrum*. This is a critical clue. It means the two species are isomers â€“ they have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight.\n        *   Characteristic 3: The mass spectrum is consistent with the *expected molecule*. This confirms we are looking at isomers of the target compound, not impurities with a different formula.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Evidence:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers.**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **NMR Properties:** In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They have identical NMR spectra and would produce only *one* set of peaks. You would need a chiral solvent or a chiral shift reagent to see separate signals, which is not mentioned. So, this contradicts the NMR data.\n        *   **LC Properties:** On a standard, achiral LC column (like a typical C18 reverse-phase column), enantiomers are indistinguishable and co-elute. They would produce a *single* peak. You need a chiral LC column to separate them. So, this contradicts the LC data.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction.**\n        *   **Definition:** This implies an extra amino acid or coupling reagent was added to the molecule.\n        *   **Mass Spec Property:** A \"double coupled\" product would have a different chemical formula and therefore a higher molecular weight than the expected product.\n        *   **Contradiction:** The MS data clearly shows that both peaks have the *same* mass, and this mass matches the *expected* molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This occurs in molecules with two or more stereocenters, where the configuration differs at some, but not all, of them.\n        *   **How this applies to peptides:** This can happen in two common ways:\n            1.  **Epimerization:** During the chemical coupling of an amino acid, the alpha-carbon can racemize. For example, coupling an L-amino acid onto a peptide chain that already contains other L-amino acids could result in some of the new residue adding as a D-amino acid. The resulting L-D-... peptide is a diastereomer of the intended L-L-... peptide.\n            2.  **Rotamers (Cis/Trans Isomerism):** The amide (peptide) bond has partial double-bond character, restricting rotation. This leads to *cis* and *trans* isomers. While the *trans* form is usually heavily favored, the barrier to rotation can be high enough that both forms are observed on the NMR timescale, especially for X-Proline bonds. These *cis* and *trans* isomers are a specific type of diastereomer.\n        *   **NMR Properties:** Diastereomers are chemically distinct molecules with different spatial arrangements. They are expected to have different NMR spectra in a standard solvent. It is very common for them to give two sets of signals, explaining the two peaks for the alpha-proton. A 1:1 ratio is also plausible.\n        *   **LC Properties:** Since they have different shapes and polarities, diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard, achiral LC, resulting in two distinct peaks.\n        *   **Mass Spec Property:** Since they are isomers, they have the identical chemical formula and molecular weight. This perfectly matches the observation that both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Option C is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor.**\n        *   **Definition:** A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate from an earlier step in the synthesis.\n        *   **Mass Spec Property:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different chemical formula and a different (usually lower) molecular weight than the final product.\n        *   **Contradiction:** The MS data shows both species have the same mass as the final, expected molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Final Synthesis:** The only explanation that fits all the facts is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereomers. They are isomers (same mass), but are distinct compounds with different physical properties, allowing them to be separated by LC and distinguished by NMR.\n\n<<<C>>>"
