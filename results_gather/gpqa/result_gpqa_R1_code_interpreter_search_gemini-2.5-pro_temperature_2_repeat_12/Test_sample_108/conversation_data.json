    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` for `1S0` tells us:\n        *   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies total spin `S_i = 0`.\n        *   The letter `S` implies orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n        *   The subscript `0` implies total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   **Parity of the initial state:** `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   **Isospin of the initial state:** The generalized Pauli principle for two identical nucleons requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. The condition is `L+S+T` must be odd. For the initial state, `L_i+S_i+T_i = 0+0+T_i` must be odd, which implies the isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\n*   **The Process:** The NN system emits a particle X. The reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN_f + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f) denotes the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X, `l_X`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Conditions for the Final State\n\nWe must check each potential transition against three main conditions:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem states a rule for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T_f=0` into the rule gives `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd number**.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the vector sum of the total angular momenta of the final products.\n    *   `vec(J_i) = vec(J_f) + vec(j_X)`\n    *   We know `J_i = 0`. The total angular momentum of particle X, `j_X`, is the sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its intrinsic spin `s_X`. Assuming X is a spin-0 particle (common in such problems unless specified otherwise), `j_X = l_X`.\n    *   The conservation law becomes `vec(0) = vec(J_f) + vec(l_X)`. This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_i = P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`\n    *   `P(NN_f)` is the parity of the final nucleon pair, which is `(-1)^L_f`.\n    *   `P(X)` is the intrinsic parity of particle X, given as `-1`.\n    *   `P_orbital` is the parity from the relative motion of `NN_f` and `X`, which is `(-1)^l_X`.\n    *   Putting it all together: `P_i = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   Since `P_i = +1`, we have `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n    *   This requires `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd number**.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's check each of the given transitions against our three conditions.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   **Final NN State:** `7D1`. This implies `2S_f+1 = 7`, which means `S_f = 3`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin `S=0` or `S=1`. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is not permitted because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   **Final NN State (`3P0`):** `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   **Particle X (`s`-wave):** `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  **Pauli:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. This is **even**. This violates the Pauli statistics condition for a `T_f=0` final state.\n    2.  **Ang. Mom.:** Is `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. (Condition satisfied).\n    3.  **Parity:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Condition satisfied).\n*   The transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle condition (`S_f + L_f` must be odd).\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   **Final NN State (`3S1`):** `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   **Particle X (`p`-wave):** `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  **Pauli:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK).\n    2.  **Ang. Mom.:** Is `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (OK).\n    3.  **Parity:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK).\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   **Final NN State (`3D3`):** `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   **Particle X (`f`-wave):** `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  **Pauli:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK).\n    2.  **Ang. Mom.:** Is `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. (OK).\n    3.  **Parity:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK).\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth transitions A and B are not permitted.\n*   Transition A is impossible because the final state `7D1` is not a valid state for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Transition B is impossible because the combination of the final state `3P0` (`S_f=1, L_f=1`) and the condition `T_f=0` violates the Pauli principle as stated in the problem (`S_f+L_f` must be odd).\n\nIn a multiple-choice context, there is likely a single intended answer. The question explicitly provides the Pauli statistics rule to be used. Option B fails this specific rule directly. The issue with option A is more of a fundamental state definition problem, and it's plausible the `7D1` term is a typo for a valid state like `3D1` (which would make transition A permitted). Therefore, the most likely intended answer is B, as its violation is directly tied to the rules provided in the question.\n\n<<<B>>>"
