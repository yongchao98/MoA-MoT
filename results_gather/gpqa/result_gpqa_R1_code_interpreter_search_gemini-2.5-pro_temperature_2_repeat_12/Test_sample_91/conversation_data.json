    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to find the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass**\nThe chemical formula provided is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms to determine the molecular formula.\n-   **(CH3)2C=**: 1 C in the main chain, 2 C in the methyl groups, and 6 H. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n-   **=CH-**: 1 C in the main chain, 1 H.\n-   **-CH2-**: 1 C in the main chain, 2 H.\n-   **-CH(CH3)-**: 1 C in the main chain, 1 C in the methyl group, and 4 H. Total: 2 C, 4 H.\n-   **-CH2-**: 1 C in the main chain, 2 H.\n-   **-CH=**: 1 C in the main chain, 1 H.\n-   **=C(CH3)2**: 1 C in the main chain, 2 C in the methyl groups, and 6 H. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n\nSumming these up:\n-   Total Carbons (C): 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n-   Total Hydrogens (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nTo perform conversions later, let's calculate the molar mass (using C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol for simplicity, which is common in such problems).\nMolar Mass (M) = 12 * 12 + 22 * 1 = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states into individual gaseous atoms.\n-   **For Carbon:** The enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol. For 12 moles of carbon atoms:\n    ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n-   **For Hydrogen:** We are given the bond energy of H-H (ΔH(H-H)) = 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to break 1 mole of H2 molecules into 2 moles of H atoms. So, the enthalpy of atomization for 1 mole of H atoms is:\n    ΔH_atom(H) = (100 kJ/mol) / 2 = 50 kJ/mol.\n    For 22 moles of hydrogen atoms:\n    ΔH_atom(H) = 22 mol * 50 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of elements (ΔHa_elements) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**3. Determine the number and type of bonds in the molecule**\nWe need to draw the structure to count the bonds:\n```\n    CH3\n      \\\n       C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C - CH3\n      /                   |              /\n    CH3                   CH3           CH3\n```\n-   **C-H bonds:** Each H atom is bonded to a C atom. There are 22 H atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n-   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure: (CH3)2**C=CH**- and -**CH=C**(CH3)2. So there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n-   **C-C single bonds:** We can find the number of C-C bonds by calculating the total bonds expected and subtracting the known ones, or by counting from the structure. Let's count:\n    -   Bonds connecting the carbons of the main chain: There are 6 single bonds in the 7-carbon backbone between the double bonds. Let's trace C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-C7, which gives C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. This is 4 C-C bonds.\n    -   Bonds connecting methyl groups: There are 2 on the first C, 1 on the fourth C, and 2 on the last C. 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 bonds.\n    -   Total C-C single bonds = 4 + 5 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Compound**\nThis is the energy released when forming one mole of the compound from its gaseous atoms.\n-   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * (Bond energy of C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ = 8800 kJ\n-   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * (Bond energy of C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ = 1800 kJ\n-   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * (Bond energy of C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ = 600 kJ\n\nTotal bond energy (BE_compound) = 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to form the atoms and the energy released when forming the molecule's bonds.\nΔHf° = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the compound)\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\nThe calculated molar enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.\n-   Option B (11200 kJ/mol) is the total bond energy, not the enthalpy of formation.\n-   Option D is 1900 kJ/g, which has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (likely a typo).\n-   Let's check the options given in kJ/g by converting our molar enthalpy of formation.\n    Specific Enthalpy of Formation = (Molar Enthalpy of Formation) / (Molar Mass)\n    Specific Enthalpy of Formation = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g.\n\nThis value is extremely close to Option A.\n\n-   **A) 11.44 kJ/g**\n-   B) 11200 kJ/mol\n-   C) 67.4 kJ/mol\n-   D) 1900 kJ/g\n\nGiven the choices, Option A is the most accurate answer, representing the specific enthalpy of formation in kJ/g.\n\n```python\n# Given values\ndHa_C = 1000  # Enthalpy of atomization of carbon in kJ/mol\nbe_HH = 100  # Bond energy of H-H in kJ/mol\nbe_CC = 200  # Bond energy of C-C in kJ/mol\nbe_CdoubleC = 300  # Bond energy of C=C in kJ/mol\nbe_CH = 400  # Bond energy of C-H in kJ/mol\n\n# Step 1: Determine molecular formula from (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\nnC = 12\nnH = 22\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the elements\ndHa_H = be_HH / 2  # Enthalpy of atomization of hydrogen\ndHa_elements = nC * dHa_C + nH * dHa_H\n\n# Step 3: Count the bonds in the molecule\n# (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\nn_CH = 22\nn_CdoubleC = 2\nn_CC = 9\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total bond energy of the compound\nBE_compound = n_CH * be_CH + n_CC * be_CC + n_CdoubleC * be_CdoubleC\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\ndHf_mol = dHa_elements - BE_compound\n\n# Step 6: Convert to kJ/g\natomic_mass_C = 12.0\natomic_mass_H = 1.0\nmolar_mass = nC * atomic_mass_C + nH * atomic_mass_H\ndHf_gram = dHf_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Molecular Formula: C{nC}H{nH}\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass: {molar_mass} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements: {dHa_elements} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Total Bond Energy of Compound: {BE_compound} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): {dHf_mol} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): {dHf_gram} kJ/g\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) of the given molecule using the provided bond energies and enthalpies of atomization. The overall process can be visualized through a Hess's Law cycle:\n\n1.  **Decomposition of reactants in their standard states into gaseous atoms:** This is the enthalpy of atomization of the elements.\n    -   Reactants: 12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H₂(g)\n    -   Gaseous atoms: 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n\n2.  **Formation of the molecule from gaseous atoms:** This is the negative of the sum of the bond energies of the molecule.\n    -   Gaseous atoms: 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n    -   Product: C₁₂H₂₂(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the sum of the enthalpy changes of these two steps.\n**ΔHf° = [Enthalpy of atomization of elements] - [Sum of bond energies of the compound]**\n\nLet's break down the calculation.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the molecular formula and count the bonds.**\nThe molecule is **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**.\n\n*   **Count Carbon atoms (C):** 2(in methyls) + 1(on C=) + 1(on =CH) + 1(on -CH₂-) + 1(on -CH) + 1(in methyl) + 1(on -CH₂-) + 1(on =CH-) + 1(on =C) + 2(in methyls) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Count Hydrogen atoms (H):** 2*3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2*3 = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n*   The molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n\nNow, let's count the types of bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 Hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by `C=C`. So there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can count them from the structure:\n    *   (CH₃)₂-C: 2 C-C bonds\n    *   C-C in the main chain: `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`. The single bonds are between C₂-C₃, C₃-C₄, C₄-C₅, C₅-C₆. That's 4 C-C bonds.\n    *   C-CH₃ (on the chain): 1 C-C bond.\n    *   C-(CH₃)₂: 2 C-C bonds.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization for the elements.**\nThis is the energy needed to convert 12 moles of C(s) and 11 moles of H₂(g) into gaseous atoms.\n*   **For Carbon:** We need 12 moles of gaseous Carbon atoms.\n    ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   **For Hydrogen:** We need 22 moles of gaseous Hydrogen atoms. The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol, which means breaking 1 mole of H₂ into 2 moles of H requires 100 kJ. The enthalpy of atomization for H is half the bond energy of H-H.\n    ΔH_atom(H) = 22 mol × (Bond energy of H-H / 2) = 22 mol × (100 kJ/mol / 2) = 22 mol × 50 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization:** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total bond energy of the compound.**\nThis is the energy released when forming 1 mole of C₁₂H₂₂ from its gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × (Bond energy of C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × (Bond energy of C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × (Bond energy of C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.\n*   **Total Bond Energy:** 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = **11200 kJ**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°).**\nΔHf° = (Total Enthalpy of Atomization) - (Total Bond Energy)\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ - 11200 kJ = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Convert the result to the units given in the options.**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.
