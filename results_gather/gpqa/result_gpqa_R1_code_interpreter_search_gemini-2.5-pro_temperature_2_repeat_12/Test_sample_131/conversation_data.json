    "This problem requires us to deduce the composition of a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic compounds by analyzing its 1H NMR spectrum. We will analyze the predicted spectrum for each possible compound and then see which combination matches the experimental data.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nSince it is a 1:1 molar mixture, the integration ratios reflect the combined protons from both compounds. The 1:1 ratio in the aromatic region means the number of protons giving rise to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second singlet.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nAll four proposed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14. Let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are all equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms and their attached methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent by this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H total).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two adjacent protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry (6H total).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H total).\n        *   This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups would show a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3). This contradicts the data that all alkyl signals are singlets. This compound can be ruled out.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining three compounds would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out due to 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio (assuming different chemical shifts). This matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four signals unless there is accidental overlap. If there's one overlap to produce three signals, the ratio would be (12+6):3:3 = 18:3:3 = 6:1:1, which does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture would show **two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). Assuming no overlap, the mixture would show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both give a 2H singlet, so a 1:1 mixture gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This matches.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). Without overlap, this would be five signals. To get three signals, there would need to be significant, specific overlaps. It is far less likely to produce a clean 2:1:1 ratio compared to option C.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only combination that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR data. The two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) come from the two non-equivalent aromatic environments in the two molecules. The three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio) come from the 12H singlet of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and the two distinct 6H singlets from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
