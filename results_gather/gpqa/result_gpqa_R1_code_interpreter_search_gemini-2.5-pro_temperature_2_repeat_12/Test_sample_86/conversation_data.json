    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound and its 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula Core:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring, C6H4) and a total of 8 carbon atoms. This means the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n        *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The compound is a halobenzene with a second substituent that contains two carbons and a carbonyl group. The halogen atom (-X, e.g., -Cl, -Br) is one substituent. The other substituent must have the formula C2HnO.\n\n2.  **Identify Possible Structures for the Second Substituent:**\n    The second substituent has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical groups that fit this description are:\n    *   **Acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH3. This fits the criteria perfectly.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group:** -CH2CHO. This also fits the criteria.\n    *   **Methoxycarbonyl (ester):** -COOCH3. This also fits.\n    *   **Carboxymethyl group:** -CH2COOH. This fits, but the acidic proton has a very characteristic broad signal, usually >10 ppm.\n\n3.  **Combine the Substituents and Ring to Form Possible Isomers:**\n    Let's focus on the most likely candidate from a chemical stability and commonality standpoint, the acetyl group.\n    *   **Structure based on Acetyl Group:** The compound would be a **haloacetophenone**. With one halogen and one acetyl group, the total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This matches the description. The general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3.\n    *   The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options in the Context of a Haloacetophenone Structure:**\n    A haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3) has:\n    *   4 aromatic protons on the benzene ring.\n    *   3 protons from the methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   Total protons = 7.\n\n    Now, let's examine the patterns expected from the isomers and compare them with the given options.\n    *   **Para-substitution (1,4-isomer):** This typically gives a very distinct pattern in the aromatic region: two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl, so it has no adjacent protons and will appear as a singlet integrating to 3H.\n    *   **Ortho/Meta-substitution:** These would give more complex patterns for the 4 aromatic protons, not two clean doublets.\n\n    Let's look at the options provided:\n    *   A) `6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)`: The proton count and splitting patterns are inconsistent with any simple haloacetophenone isomer. Incorrect.\n    *   B) `4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)`: This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This is impossible for a compound with an aromatic ring. Incorrect.\n    *   C) `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`:\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)` is the classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring with two different substituents. It integrates to 4H.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** `2.3 (3H, s)` is a singlet integrating to 3 protons, which perfectly matches the methyl group of an acetyl (-COCH3) substituent.\n        *   **Overall:** This spectrum is an excellent match for a **p-haloacetophenone**. The acetyl group (-COCH3) and the halogen (-X) are both electron-withdrawing groups, which deshield the aromatic protons, pushing their chemical shifts downfield to the observed 7.6-7.8 ppm range. This option is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   D) `9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`:\n        *   This spectrum suggests a different structure. The `9.9 (1H, s)` peak is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The `3.7 (2H, s)` peak suggests a methylene (-CH2-) group next to an electron-withdrawing group but with no adjacent protons. This matches the formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO). The aromatic pattern is again for para-substitution. So this would be **p-halo-(phenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n        *   **Consistency Check:** The problem with this option is the chemical shift of the aromatic protons. A -CH2CHO group is only weakly electron-withdrawing because the C=O group is not directly conjugated with the ring. Therefore, the aromatic protons would be expected at a much higher field (further upfield, lower ppm), typically around 7.2-7.4 ppm. The value of 7.6-7.8 ppm is too far downfield and inconsistent with this structure.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data in option C is the only one that is fully consistent with a structure that meets all the criteria given in the problem. The compound is a p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **Structure:** p-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4'-Bromoacetophenone).\n    *   **Carbons:** 8 carbons (6 ring + 2 acetyl). Correct.\n    *   **FTIR:** Contains C=O and Ar-X. Correct.\n    *   **1H NMR:** A para-substituted aromatic pattern (two doublets, 4H total) and a methyl singlet (3H). The chemical shifts in the aromatic region (7.6-7.8 ppm) are consistent with the strong deshielding effect of a conjugated carbonyl group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
