    "This problem asks for the number of possible organic products from the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia.\n\n### **1. Identify the Reaction Type**\n\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (NaNH2). These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n### **2. Step 1: Elimination to Form Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) is a strong base that will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (bromine).\n\nThe starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Let's draw it and number the carbons:\n\n```\n      D(2)\n     /\nBr(1)-C===C\n    |   |\n  H(6)-C---C-H(3)\n     \\  /\n      C==C\n      |  |\n      H(5) H(4)\n```\n\nThe positions ortho to the bromine at C-1 are C-2 and C-6.\n*   C-2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n*   C-6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe amide base can abstract a cation from either of these positions, leading to two different elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H⁺ from C-6**\n    The base removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6, and subsequently, the bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C-1. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond. Therefore, this is the **major pathway**.\n    The elimination of H from C-6 and Br from C-1 results in a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium at C-2 is unaffected. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D⁺ from C-2**\n    The base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2, and Br⁻ is eliminated from C-1. This pathway is slower than Pathway A due to the stronger C-D bond but still occurs. This is the **minor pathway**.\n    When the deuteron is abstracted from C-2, it is removed from the molecule. The resulting triple bond forms between C-1 and C-2. The intermediate is the normal, undeuterated **benzyne**.\n\n     \n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne (major) and benzyne (minor).\n\n### **3. Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile in this reaction is the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which will add to the triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (liquid ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium is at C-2. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-1. The resulting carbanion at C-6 is protonated by NH₃. The product has the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-6. The resulting carbanion at C-1 is protonated. This places the -NH₂ group at C-6 relative to the deuterium at C-2. After renumbering to give the substituent the lowest number, this is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    Thus, the major intermediate (3-deuterobenzyne) yields two distinct products.\n\n*   **Products from Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The intermediate is the symmetrical, undeuterated benzyne.\n    1.  **Attack at the triple bond:** The nucleophile NH₂⁻ adds to one of the carbons of the triple bond, and the other carbon is protonated. Due to symmetry, the attack at either carbon leads to the same single product: **aniline** (undeuterated).\n\n### **4. Summary of Products**\n\nCombining all the possible products from both pathways:\n1.  **2-Deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-Deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are three possible, chemically distinct organic products formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
