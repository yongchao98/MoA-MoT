    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the laboratory frame be the stationary frame, denoted as **S**. The observer is in this frame.\n    *   Let the frame of the moving glass be the moving frame, denoted as **S'**. This frame is moving with a velocity **v** relative to the lab frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S) is **v**.\n    *   The speed of light *within the glass* is defined by the index of refraction, `n`. The speed of light in the glass, as measured by an observer in the glass's rest frame (S'), is `u' = c/n`.\n    *   The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum, `c`, as 1. Therefore, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   We need to find the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory (frame S). Let's call this velocity **u**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    Since we are dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, we must use Einstein's relativistic velocity addition formula, not the classical Galilean addition (`u = u' + v`). The formula for velocities in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' * v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these values gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / ( n * (1 + v/n) )`\n    `u = (n*(1/n) + n*v) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated speed `u` is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
