    "*   **1. Identify the chemical equilibrium:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex, denoted as $[CaY]^{2-}$ (where Y represents the EDTA ligand), is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n*   **2. Write the dissociation reaction:**\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n*   **3. Determine the equilibrium constant for dissociation ($K_d$):**\n    The problem gives the formation constant, $K_f$ (also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which is for the reaction $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$.\n    $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    The dissociation constant ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n    The equilibrium expression for dissociation is:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]}$\n\n*   **4. Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:**\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates. The stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1:1.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    The phrase \"ideal pH\" implies we can use the given formation constant without worrying about the protonation of the EDTA ligand, so we can assume $[EDTA]_{total, free} \\approx [Y^{4-}]$.\n\n*   **5. Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the $K_d$ expression:**\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\n*   **6. Make a simplifying assumption:**\n    Since $K_f$ is very large, the dissociation is minimal. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can assume that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n*   **7. Solve for 'x':**\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n*   **8. Final Answer:**\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x'.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option A.\n\nWe can use python to compute the value more accurately.\n```python\nimport math\n\nC_initial = 0.02  # Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA\nKf = 5e10         # Formation constant\n\n# Kd is the dissociation constant\nKd = 1 / Kf\n\n# We need to solve the quadratic equation x^2 + Kd*x - Kd*C_initial = 0\n# However, we can use the approximation Kd = x^2 / C_initial\n# x^2 = Kd * C_initial\nx = math.sqrt(Kd * C_initial)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.1e}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
