    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum amount of a strong acid needed to dissolve a specific amount of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, and the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Chemical Reaction:** The dissolution of solid Fe(OH)3 in an acidic solution is a neutralization reaction. Fe(OH)3 is a base, and the strong acid provides H+ ions. The balanced chemical equation is:\n    Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This stoichiometry shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions just to react and be converted into Fe³⁺ ions.\n\n2.  **Solubility Equilibrium:** Even after the neutralization reaction, for the iron(III) hydroxide to *remain* dissolved, the ion product (Q) must be less than or equal to the solubility product constant (Ksp). To find the *minimum* amount of acid, we consider the boundary condition where the solution is saturated.\n    The equilibrium is: Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The Ksp expression is: Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n    We need a value for Ksp for Fe(OH)3 at 25°C. Literature values vary, often cited in the range of 10⁻³⁶ to 10⁻³⁹. The problem is a multiple-choice question, so we can work backward from the given options to find a consistent scenario.\n\n3.  **Moles and Concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    *   First, we calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved.\n        *   Mass of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g\n        *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = (atomic mass of Fe) + 3 * (atomic mass of O + atomic mass of H) = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n    *   When this amount is dissolved in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L), the concentration of Fe³⁺ will be:\n        *   [Fe³⁺] = (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M.\n\n4.  **Determining the Final pH:**\n    *   Using the Ksp expression, we can calculate the maximum concentration of hydroxide ions, [OH⁻], that can exist in equilibrium with the [Fe³⁺]. This [OH⁻] will determine the final pH of the solution.\n    *   [OH⁻] = (Ksp / [Fe³⁺])^(1/3)\n    *   From [OH⁻], we find pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]), and then pH = 14.00 - pOH.\n    *   Since Ksp is not given, let's test the pH from one of the options. Let's test option C.\n\n5.  **Testing Option C (pH = 2.69):**\n    *   If pH = 2.69, then pOH = 14.00 - 2.69 = 11.31.\n    *   The corresponding hydroxide concentration is [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.³¹ M.\n    *   We can calculate the implied Ksp value:\n        *   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.357 x 10⁻³ M) * (10⁻¹¹.³¹ M)³ ≈ 1.1 x 10⁻³⁶.\n    *   This Ksp value is within the range of plausible values reported in the literature, making this pH a likely candidate.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Required Volume of Acid:**\n    *   The total amount of H+ added from the strong acid (n_H⁺_added) serves two purposes:\n        a.  **Neutralize Fe(OH)3:** This amount, n_H⁺_react, is determined by the stoichiometry: n_H⁺_react = 3 * (moles of Fe(OH)3).\n        b.  **Establish the final pH:** The remaining H+ ions, n_H⁺_final, determine the final acidity of the 100 cm³ solution. n_H⁺_final = [H⁺]_final * (Total Volume).\n    *   The total moles of acid required is the sum: n_H⁺_added = n_H⁺_react + n_H⁺_final.\n    *   Let's calculate this for the pH = 2.69 scenario:\n        *   n_H⁺_react = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n        *   [H⁺]_final = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M ≈ 2.042 x 10⁻³ M.\n        *   n_H⁺_final = (2.042 x 10⁻³ M) * (0.1 L) = 2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n        *   n_H⁺_added = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) + (2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 3.011 x 10⁻³ mol.\n    *   Finally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M acid needed to provide this many moles:\n        *   Volume = n_H⁺_added / Concentration = (3.011 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.03011 L.\n        *   Converting to cm³: Volume = 0.03011 L * 1000 cm³/L = 30.11 cm³.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ is in excellent agreement with the volume of 30.09 cm³ provided in option C. The combination of pH 2.69 and volume 30.09 cm³ forms a self-consistent solution based on established chemical principles and a plausible Ksp value.\n\nWe can verify the calculation with a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants and Given Values ---\nmass_fe_oh3 = 0.1  # grams\ntotal_volume = 0.1  # Liters (100 cm3)\nacid_concentration = 0.1  # M\n\n# --- Molar Masses (g/mol) ---\nMM_Fe = 55.845\nMM_O = 15.999\nMM_H = 1.008\nMM_FeOH3 = MM_Fe + 3 * (MM_O + MM_H)\n\n# --- Calculations for Option C ---\ntarget_pH = 2.69\nexpected_volume_cm3 = 30.09\n\n# 1.

    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe main goal is to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid (like HCl) needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in a final volume of 100 cm³, and also to find the pH of this final solution.\n\n### **2. Stoichiometry of Dissolution**\nFirst, let's write the chemical reaction for the dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, a base, in a strong acid (source of H⁺ ions):\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\nThis equation tells us that for every 1 mole of solid Fe(OH)₃ that dissolves, we need to consume 3 moles of H⁺ ions. This is the amount of acid required for the neutralization reaction itself.\n\n### **3. Equilibrium Condition for Dissolution**\nFor the Fe(OH)₃ to remain dissolved and not re-precipitate, the solution must be sufficiently acidic. This is governed by the solubility product (Ksp) equilibrium:\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\nThe term \"minimum volume of acid\" implies we are looking for the highest possible pH (least acidic condition) at which the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ can be fully dissolved. This corresponds to a saturated solution, where the ion product equals the Ksp.\n\n### **4. Calculate Moles and Concentration of Iron**\nWe first need to know how many moles of Fe(OH)₃ we are dissolving.\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n    *   O: 15.999 g/mol\n    *   H: 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n*   **Concentration of Fe³⁺ ([Fe³⁺]):**\n    *   This amount is dissolved in a final volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\n### **5. Calculate Total Acid Needed**\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid (let's call it `n_H⁺_total`) is used for two things:\n1.  **Reaction (`n_H⁺_react`):** To neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ as per the stoichiometry.\n2.  **Final Acidity (`n_H⁺_final`):** To maintain the final H⁺ concentration in the 100 cm³ solution, which dictates the final pH.\n\nSo, `n_H⁺_total` = `n_H⁺_react` + `n_H⁺_final`\n\n### **6. Working Backwards from the Options**\nSince we don't know the Ksp value for Fe(OH)₃, we cannot directly calculate the required pH. The most efficient strategy for a multiple-choice question is to test the provided options to see which one is self-consistent. Let's test Option C.\n\n**Test Case: Option C (pH = 2.69; Volume = 30.09 cm³)**\n\n*   **Step 6a: Calculate the moles of H⁺ required to achieve this state.**\n    *   **Moles for reaction (`n_H⁺_react`):**\n        `n_H⁺_react` = 3 * (moles of Fe(OH)₃) = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n    *   **Moles for final acidity (`n_H⁺_final`):**\n        A pH of 2.69 means the final H⁺ concentration is [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M ≈ 2.042 x 10⁻³ M.\n        In the final volume of 100 mL (0.1 L), the moles of free H⁺ are:\n        `n_H⁺_final` = [H⁺] * Volume = (2.042 x 10⁻³ mol/L) * 0.1 L = 2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n    *   **Total moles of H⁺ needed (`n_H⁺_total`):**\n        `n_H⁺_total` = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (2.042 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.011 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Step 6b: Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid that provides this many moles.**\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration\n    *   Volume = (3.011 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.03011 L\n    *   Convert to cm³: Volume = 0.03011 L * 1000 cm³/L = 30.11 cm³\n\n*   **Step 6c: Compare with the option.**\n    *   Our calculated volume is 30.11 cm³.\n    *   The volume given in Option C is 30.09 cm³.\n    *   This is an extremely close match. The small difference can be attributed to rounding during intermediate steps or the use of slightly different molar masses.\n\nThe python code executed previously confirmed this calculation, yielding a required volume of 30.11 cm³ for a target pH of 2.69. This strongly supports that Option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
