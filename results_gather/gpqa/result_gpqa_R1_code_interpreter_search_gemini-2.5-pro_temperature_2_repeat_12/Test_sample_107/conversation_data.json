    "The user wants to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with a specific transition energy in the Hydrogen atom.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Term\n\nThe energy of the paramagnetic coupling (Zeeman effect) for an electron in a magnetic field `B` is given by the Hamiltonian:\n\n$$H_Z = - \\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$$\n\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment. This is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n\n$$\\vec{\\mu}_L = - \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian equation:\n\n$$H_Z = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$$\n\nThe magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = (0, 0, B)$. The dot product simplifies to:\n\n$$H_Z = \\frac{e}{2m_e} L_z B$$\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the angular momentum, $L_z$, is quantized and is given by $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Therefore, the energy shift is:\n\n$$\\left\\langle H_Z \\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is a fundamental constant known as the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$. Its value is approximately $5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$.\n\nSo, the paramagnetic coupling energy is:\n\n$$\\left\\langle H_Z \\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$\n*   $m$ is a small integer (e.g., $m=1, 2, ...$). For an order of magnitude calculation, we can take $m=1$.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n$$\\left\\langle H_Z \\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$$\n\nSo, the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy is $10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Transition Energy\n\nThe transition energy $\\Delta E$ can be calculated from the given wavelength $\\lambda$ of the emitted or absorbed photon using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$\n*   The product of Planck's constant and the speed of light, $hc$, is a convenient constant with a value of approximately $1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}$.\n\nFirst, convert the wavelength to nanometers:\n\n$$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$$\n\nNow, calculate the energy:\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.551 \\, \\text{eV}$$\n\nSo, the order of magnitude of the transition energy is approximately $1 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Magnitudes\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H_Z \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n\n$$\\frac{\\left\\langle H_Z \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.551 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$$\n\nThis ratio is very small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\nFor context, the wavelength $\\lambda = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$ corresponds to the Balmer-beta line in the Hydrogen spectrum, which is the transition from the $n=4$ to the $n=2$ energy level. The Zeeman splitting caused by a 1T magnetic field is a very fine perturbation on top of this much larger energy transition.\n\n<<<C>>>"
