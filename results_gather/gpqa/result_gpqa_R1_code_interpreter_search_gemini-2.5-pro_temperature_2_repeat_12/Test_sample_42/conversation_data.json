    "This problem requires the systematic application of IUPAC nomenclature rules for substituted aromatic compounds.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Principal Functional Group\n\nThe molecule contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, also known as formyl as a substituent)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned locant **C1**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Positions of Substituents and Number the Ring\n\nWe are given the following positional information:\n1.  The carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano groups are all **meta** to one another. Since the carboxylic acid is at C1, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups must be at positions C3 and C5.\n2.  The hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are **ortho** to the carboxylic acid. This places them at positions C2 and C6.\n3.  The methoxy group is **para** to the carboxylic acid. This places it at position C4.\n4.  A crucial piece of information: The methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group (at C2 or C6) are both **ortho** to the cyano group.\n    *   For the methoxy group at C4 to be ortho to the cyano group, the cyano group must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our first point.\n    *   For the hydroxyl group to be ortho to the cyano group, we must test the two possibilities:\n        *   **Case A:** If the cyano group is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since the methoxy is already at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C2.\n        *   **Case B:** If the cyano group is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since the methoxy is at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n\nThis gives us two possible structures for the substituents on the benzoic acid ring:\n\n*   **Structure 1 (from Case A):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n    *   The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n*   **Structure 2 (from Case B):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n    *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C6: -OH (hydroxyl)\n    *   The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Lowest Locant Rule\n\nBoth potential numbering schemes give the exact same set of locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the locant sets are identical, IUPAC rules state that we must use the numbering scheme that assigns the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n### Step 4: Alphabetize Substituents and Select the Correct Numbering\n\nLet's list the substituents and alphabetize them:\n1.  **c**yano\n2.  **d**imethylamino (prefixes like 'di', 'tri' are not used for alphabetization unless they are part of a complex substituent name, but 'dimethylamino' is treated as a whole, starting with 'd')\n3.  **f**ormyl\n4.  **h**ydroxy\n5.  **m**ethoxy\n\nNow we compare our two structures based on the locant given to the first group in the alphabetical list, \"cyano\":\n*   In Structure 1, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n*   In Structure 2, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, **Structure 1** represents the correct numbering scheme.\n\n### Step 5: Construct the Final IUPAC Name\n\nUsing Structure 1, we list the substituents alphabetically, each preceded by its locant number, and append the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nCombining them in alphabetical order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering, corresponds to Structure 2)\nB) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct)\nC) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\nD) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
