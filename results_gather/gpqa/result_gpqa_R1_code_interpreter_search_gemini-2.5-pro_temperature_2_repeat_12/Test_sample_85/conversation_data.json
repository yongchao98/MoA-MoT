    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** Both reactions produce 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). This molecule has a single stereocenter at the C4 position, where the ethyl group is attached. The two reactions yield the two possible enantiomers: (R) and (S).\n*   **Lactone Formation:** Lactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization of hydroxy acids (or hydroxy esters). A six-membered ring lactone (delta-lactone) like this one is formed from a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid derivative. Specifically, the precursor to 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid (or an ester thereof). The stereocenter in this precursor is at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group), which becomes C4 in the lactone. The cyclization step itself does not alter the configuration of the stereocenter. Therefore:\n    *   (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid (or its derivatives).\n    *   (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid (or its derivatives).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\n*   The options for starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Let's draw this structure. The name indicates a pentanoic acid backbone with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at C1, and an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`) at C5. There is an ethyl group at the C3 stereocenter.\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)\n*   This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid), where one carboxylic acid is free and the other is an isobutyl ester. It has two different carbonyl functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters and aldehydes/ketones. It reduces carboxylic acids much more slowly. In our starting material, LiBH₄ will preferentially reduce the **ester group** at C5 to a primary alcohol.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is left untouched.\n    3.  The reduction doesn't break any bonds at the C3 stereocenter, so its absolute 3D arrangement is preserved.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n    5.  Acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry Analysis:** This is the crucial part. We need to see if the stereochemical descriptor (R or S) changes during the transformation from starting material A to the intermediate hydroxy acid.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material A (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid):** The four groups attached to the C3 stereocenter are H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. Using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (P2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (P3)\n        4.  `H` (P4)\n        (The ester group has higher priority than the acid group because the ester's oxygen is bonded to a carbon, while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen. C > H).\n    *   **Priorities in the Intermediate (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid):** The reduction converts the `-CH₂COOiBu` group to a `-CH₂CH₂OH` group. The groups at C3 are now H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂CH₂OH. Let's re-evaluate the priorities:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (P'1)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (P'2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (P'3)\n        4.  `H` (P'4)\n    *   **Change in Descriptor:** The group that was priority 1 (P1) in the starting material becomes priority 2 (P'2) in the intermediate. The group that was priority 2 (P2) becomes priority 1 (P'1) in the intermediate. The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. This **inverts** the R/S descriptor. For example, if we start with the (S)-enantiomer of A, the intermediate formed will be the (R)-enantiomer of the hydroxy acid.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the reaction produces the (R)-lactone, it must have come from the (R)-hydroxy acid intermediate. To get the (R)-hydroxy acid intermediate, we must start with the **(S)-starting material A**.\n    *   (S)-A ---> (R)-hydroxy acid ---> (R)-lactone.\n    *   **Therefore, A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n### **5. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) is left untouched.\n    3.  The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  Acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone and isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry Analysis:**\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material B:** Same as for A: `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (P3).\n    *   **Priorities in the Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The reduction converts the `-CH₂COOH` group to a `-CH₂CH₂OH` group. The groups are H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOiBu, and -CH₂CH₂OH. Let's re-evaluate the priorities:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (P''1)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (P''2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (P''3)\n        4.  `H` (P''4)\n    *   **Change in Descriptor:** Let's compare the priority order of the groups before and after the reaction. The starting material P1 group is still the highest priority group (P''1). The starting material P2 group is reduced, and the resulting group has priority P''2. The P3 group remains P''3. The priority order of the groups does not change (i.e., the group derived from P1 is still higher than the group from P2, which is still higher than the group from P3). Therefore, the R/S descriptor is **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the reaction produces the (S)-lactone, it must have come from the (S)-hydroxy ester intermediate. Since the configuration is retained in this reaction, we must start with the **(S)-starting material B**.\n    *   (S)-B ---> (S)-hydroxy ester ---> (S)-lactone.\n    *   **Therefore, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, both starting materials A and B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
