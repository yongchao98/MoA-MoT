    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, $S_y$.\n\n**1. Define the State and the Operator**\n\n*   The unnormalized spin state of the electron is given by the column vector (ket):\n    $|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   The spin operator in the y-direction is given by:\n    $S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $\\sigma_y$ is the Pauli Y-matrix.\n\n*   The Pauli Y-matrix is:\n    $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   So, the spin operator is:\n    $S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2. The Formula for Expectation Value**\n\nThe expectation value of an operator $A$ for a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the formula:\n$\\langle A \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle}{\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle}$\n\nIn our case, $A = S_y$ and $|\\psi\\rangle = |\\chi\\rangle$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Components**\n\nWe need to calculate the numerator $\\langle \\chi | S_y | \\chi \\rangle$ and the denominator $\\langle \\chi | \\chi \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Denominator $\\langle \\chi | \\chi \\rangle$ (Normalization):**\n    First, find the bra vector $\\langle \\chi |$, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\chi\\rangle$:\n    $|\\chi\\rangle^\\dagger = \\langle \\chi | = \\begin{pmatrix} (3i)^* & 4^* \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, calculate the inner product $\\langle \\chi | \\chi \\rangle$:\n    $\\langle \\chi | \\chi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i^2 + 16$\n    Since $i^2 = -1$:\n    $\\langle \\chi | \\chi \\rangle = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25$\n\n*   **Numerator $\\langle \\chi | S_y | \\chi \\rangle$:**\n    First, let's apply the operator $S_y$ to the ket $|\\chi\\rangle$:\n    $S_y |\\chi\\rangle = \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\\\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ 3i^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, pre-multiply this result by the bra $\\langle \\chi |$:\n    $\\langle \\chi | S_y | \\chi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) \\right]$\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [12i^2 - 12]$\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [-12 - 12]$\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [-24] = -12\\hbar$\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Expectation Value**\n\nNow, divide the numerator by the denominator:\n$\\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{-12\\hbar}{25}$\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) -25*hbar/2\nB) 12*hbar/25\nC) -12*hbar/25\nD) 25*hbar/2\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
