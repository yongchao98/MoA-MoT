    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of pH at two different points in a titration process. First, we need to account for the dilution of the acetic acid, and then apply the principles of acid-base equilibria for a weak acid-strong base titration.\n\n**Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm3\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Final volume of the solution (V2) = 20.00 cm3 (acid) + 20.00 cm3 (water) = 40.00 cm3\n*   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2, we find the new concentration (M2).\n    M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm3) / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm3 of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Titration and Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation**\nThe titration reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH -> CH3COONa + H2O\n\nWe are given:\n*   Concentration of the diluted acetic acid ([HA]) = 0.025 M\n*   Volume of the acetic acid solution = 40.00 cm3 = 0.040 L\n*   Concentration of the titrant, NaOH = 0.1 M\n*   Acid dissociation constant (Ka) for CH3COOH = 1.85 x 10^-5\n\nFirst, let's find the pKa of acetic acid:\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.73\n\n**Step 3: Calculating pH at 25% Titration**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains. This mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base forms a buffer solution.\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\nwhere [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n\nAt 25% titration, the ratio of [A-] to [HA] is 25/75, or 1/3.\npH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\npH = 4.73 - 0.477\npH ≈ 4.253\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating pH at the Equivalence Point**\nFirst, we determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point, where moles of acid = moles of base.\n*   Moles of CH3COOH = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n*   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm3\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the CH3COOH has reacted to form CH3COO-.\n*   Moles of CH3COO- formed = 0.001 mol\n*   Total volume of solution = Volume of acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm3 + 10.00 cm3 = 50.00 cm3 = 0.050 L\n*   Concentration of CH3COO- = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\nThe acetate ion (CH3COO-) is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH- ions:\nCH3COO- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH-\n\nWe need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid and the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10^-14 at 25 °C).\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 5.41 x 10^-10\n\nNow we can set up an equilibrium calculation to find the [OH-]. Let x = [OH-].\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-]\n5.41 x 10^-10 = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\nAssuming x is small compared to 0.02, we can simplify:\nx^2 ≈ (5.41 x 10^-10) * 0.02\nx^2 ≈ 1.082 x 10^-11\nx = [OH-] ≈ 3.29 x 10^-6 M\n\nNow, calculate pOH and then pH:\npOH = -log([OH-]) = -log(3.29 x 10^-6) ≈ 5.48\npH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Dilution Step ---\nC_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nV_acid_initial = 20.00 # cm3\nV_water = 20.00      # cm3\nV_acid_final = V_acid_initial + V_water\nC_acid_final = (C_acid_initial * V_acid_initial) / V_acid_final\n\n# --- Titration Parameters ---\nC_base = 0.1  # M (NaOH)\ninitial_moles_acid = C_acid_final * (V_acid_final / 1000) # in Liters for moles calculation\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% titration ---\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at the equivalence point ---\n# Moles of acid = moles of base at equivalence point\n# C_acid_final * V_acid_final = C_base * V_base_eq\nV_base_eq_cm3 = (C_acid_final * V_acid_final) / C_base\n# Total volume at equivalence point in L\nV_total_eq_L = (V_acid_final + V_base_eq_cm3) / 1000\n# At equivalence point, all acid is converted to its conjugate base\nmoles_conjugate_base = initial_moles_acid\nC_conjugate_base = moles_conjugate_base / V_total_eq_L\n# Hydrolysis of conjugate base: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-] => [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\n# We assume x = [OH-] is much smaller than C_conjugate_base\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * C_conjugate_base)\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are 4.26 for the 25% titration point and 8.52 for the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nThe initial volume of 0.05 M acetic acid is 20.00 cm³. It is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   Initial concentration (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2, we find the final concentration (M2):\n    M2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\nSo, we are titrating a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nThe reaction is CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O.\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acid remains. This forms a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base concentration ([A⁻]) to the acid concentration ([HA]) is 25/75, or 1/3.\n*   Now, plug the values into the equation:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form acetate (CH₃COO⁻). We need to find the concentration of this acetate solution and then calculate the pH resulting from its hydrolysis.\n\n*   **Find moles of acid:**\n    Moles of CH₃COOH = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol\n*   **Find volume of NaOH added:**\n    At the equivalence point, moles of acid = moles of base.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Find the concentration of acetate:**\n    Total volume = Volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Calculate pH from acetate hydrolysis:**\n    Acetate is a weak base and reacts with water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    Now, we set up an equilibrium expression to find [OH⁻]:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we can simplify:\n    x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This matches the values in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
