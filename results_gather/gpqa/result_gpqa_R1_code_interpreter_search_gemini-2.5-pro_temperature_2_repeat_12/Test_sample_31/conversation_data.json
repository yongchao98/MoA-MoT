    "E_total = E_kinetic + E_rest_mass\nThe rest mass of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) is:\nThe number of protons in Li is 3, and the number of neutrons is given as 3. Therefore, the total number of nucleons A = 3 + 3 = 6. The nucleus is Lithium-6.\n\nWe can approximate the mass of the nucleus by summing the masses of its constituents:\nMass of proton: 1.007276 u\nMass of neutron: 1.008665 u\nMass of 3 protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u\nMass of 3 neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u\nTotal mass: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u\n\nWe must account for the binding energy, which reduces the total mass. The actual mass of a Lithium-6 nucleus is approximately 6.015122 u.\n\nNow, we convert this mass to energy in GeV:\n1 u = 931.494 MeV/c² = 0.931494 GeV/c²\nRest mass E₀ = 6.015122 u * 0.931494 GeV/u = 5.60303 GeV\n\nThe total relativistic energy E is given by the formula:\nE = γ * E₀\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).\n\nGiven v = 0.96c, we can calculate γ:\nv/c = 0.96\nv²/c² = 0.96² = 0.9216\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.5714\n\nNow, we calculate the total energy E:\nE = 3.5714 * 5.60303 GeV = 20.0108 GeV\n\nLet's refine the calculation with more precise values:\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857\nE₀ = 6.01512279 u * 931.494102 MeV/u = 5603.048 MeV = 5.603048 GeV\nE = 3.57142857 * 5.603048 GeV ≈ 20.01088 GeV\n\nThis energy is for a single Lithium-6 nucleus. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) accelerates two beams of ions in opposite directions. The energy of the collider is typically quoted as the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair, or the total energy of one beam. Given the options, the question is likely asking for the total energy of a single nucleus.\n\nNone of the provided options (A, B, C, D) are close to 20.011 GeV. There might be a misunderstanding of the question or an error in the provided options. However, let's re-examine the question's premise. The energy of a collider can be stated in different ways, but the \"energy of the collider...so that the speed is 0.96c\" points to the total energy of the projectile.\n\nLet's re-calculate using the provided options to see if one of them corresponds to a plausible interpretation.\nIf we consider the kinetic energy per nucleon, we have:\nKinetic Energy (KE) = (γ - 1) * E₀ = (3.5714 - 1) * 5.603 GeV = 2.5714 * 5.603 GeV = 14.408 GeV.\nKE per nucleon = 14.408 GeV / 6 = 2.401 GeV/nucleon.\n\nLet's check the options again. It seems there's a significant discrepancy. Let's recalculate with a different approach. The energy given in GeV might refer to GeV per nucleon.\nTotal energy per nucleon = E / A = 20.011 GeV / 6 = 3.335 GeV/nucleon.\n\nIf we assume one of the answers is correct, let's work backward.\nAssume A) 23.069 GeV is the total energy.\nγ = E / E₀ = 23.069 / 5.603 = 4.117\nv/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - 1/4.117²) = sqrt(1 - 0.0589) = 0.970c. This is not 0.96c.\n\nAssume B) 20.132 GeV is the total energy.\nγ = E / E₀ = 20.132 / 5.603 = 3.593\nv/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - 1/3.593²) = sqrt(1 - 0.0772) = 0.9606c. This is very close to 0.96c.\n\nAssume C) 18.475 GeV is the total energy.\nγ = E / E₀ = 18.475 / 5.603 = 3.297\nv/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - 1/3.297²) = sqrt(1 - 0.0921) = 0.953c. This is not 0.96c.\n\nAssume D) 21.419 GeV is the total energy.\nγ = E / E₀ = 21.419 / 5.603 = 3.823\nv/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - 1/3.823²) = sqrt(1 - 0.0683) = 0.965c. This is also close, but B is closer.\n\nThe discrepancy between the calculated value (20.011 GeV) and the closest option (20.132 GeV) might stem from a slightly different value used for the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The values for fundamental constants can have slight variations in different sources. However, the calculation strongly supports that B is the intended answer. The slight difference (0.6%) is likely due to the precise mass values used by the source of the problem.\n\nLet's use the provided answer to verify the speed:\nE = 20.132 GeV\nγ = 20.132 / 5.603048 = 3.59303\nv/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - 1/(3.59303)²) = sqrt(1 - 0.07722) = 0.9606. This rounds to 0.96.\n\nFinal check of calculation:\nγ for v=0.96c is exactly 1/0.28.\nE = (1/0.28) * 5.603048 GeV = 20.01088 GeV.\nOption B is 20.132 GeV. The difference is 0.121 GeV. It's the closest answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
