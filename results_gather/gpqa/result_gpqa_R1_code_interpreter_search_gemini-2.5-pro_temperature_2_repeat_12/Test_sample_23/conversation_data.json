    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen (w(H)) of 14.28%.\n    *   Z does not react further with hydrogen, indicating it is a saturated hydrocarbon. The general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon is CnH(2n+2) (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n    *   Let's test the cycloalkane formula, CnH2n.\n        *   Atomic mass of C ≈ 12 g/mol\n        *   Atomic mass of H ≈ 1 g/mol\n        *   w(H) = (Mass of H) / (Total Mass) = (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   Let's calculate the value of 1/7.\n    ```python\n    print(1/7)\n    ```\n    *   The result is approximately 0.142857, which matches the given 14.28%.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   We are also told Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* Z. This implies that all compounds in these mixtures have the same number of carbon atoms. We can infer that n=6 is the most likely case, given the reactions described (especially disproportionation leading to aromatic rings). So, let's hypothesize that **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from X.\n    *   Y does *not* decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated (or aromatic, which also doesn't react with bromine water).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call it Y1.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y1 (cyclohexane) gives cyclohexane (no reaction).\n        *   Hydrogenation of the other component, Y2, must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   This reaction (Y -> Z) is a result of a disproportionation reaction (X -> Y). A classic disproportionation of cyclic C6 hydrocarbons on a Pt catalyst involves hydrogen transfer to form a saturated cycloalkane and a stable aromatic compound.\n    *   Let's propose that the products are cyclohexane and benzene.\n        *   Y1 = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   Y2 = Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   Let's check if this fits the conditions for Y:\n        *   Mixture of two liquids: Yes, at standard conditions, both are liquids.\n        *   Does not decolorize bromine water: Yes, saturated alkanes and aromatic rings do not react with Br2 water.\n        *   Hydrogenation gives only Z:\n            *   Cyclohexane + H2 -> Cyclohexane.\n            *   Benzene + 3H2 -> Cyclohexane.\n            *   This is correct. The hydrogenation of this mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n    *   The problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture. This means the disproportionation reaction that forms Y must produce cyclohexane and benzene in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   X *does* decolorize bromine water, so its components are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both components of X must be C6 compounds whose carbon skeleton can be hydrogenated to a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The reaction X -> Y is an equimolar disproportionation. Based on our proposed Y, the reaction is:\n        (Mixture X) -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6) [in a 1:1 ratio]\n    *   Since X is an equimolar mixture of two components, X1 and X2, the reaction is likely:\n        **X1 + X2 -> C6H12 + C6H6**\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is hydrogenated, the other is dehydrogenated. Let's check the atom balance.\n        *   Right side: C = 6+6 = 12; H = 12+6 = 18.\n        *   Left side must also have 12 carbons and 18 hydrogens in total from one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2.\n    *   Let's find plausible structures for X1 and X2:\n        *   They must be C6 cyclic compounds that hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n        *   They must be unsaturated.\n        *   They must not have conjugated bonds.\n        *   Their total H-atom count must be 18.\n    *   Let's consider unsaturated derivatives of cyclohexane:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One C=C bond. No conjugation. Hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n        *   **1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two C=C bonds. They are conjugated. This is ruled out by the problem statement.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two C=C bonds. They are isolated (not conjugated). This is a valid candidate. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's propose X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   Are they liquids? Yes.\n        *   Are they equimolar in mixture X? Yes.\n        *   Do they decolorize bromine water? Yes.\n        *   No conjugated bonds? Correct.\n    *   Let's check the H-atom count for the reaction:\n        *   H atoms in X1 (C6H10) = 10.\n        *   H atoms in X2 (C6H8) = 8.\n        *   Total H atoms on the left = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   Total H atoms on the right = 12 (from C6H12) + 6 (from C6H6) = 18.\n    *   The proposed reaction, Cyclohexene + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene -> Cyclohexane + Benzene, is balanced and chemically plausible as a disproportionation on a platinum catalyst. This model fits all the conditions given in the problem.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2.\n    *   Liquid 1 (X1) is cyclohexene, C6**H10**. It has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (X2) is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6**H8**. It has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
