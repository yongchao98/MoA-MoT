    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement**\n    *   The first piece of information is how the number of stars (N) depends on parallax (plx). The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\" describes a distribution. In physics and mathematics, this typically refers to the number density or the differential count. So, we can express this as the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, dN/d(plx).\n    *   Given:  `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵` or `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n\n    *   The question asks for \"how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\". This is unambiguously asking for the number of stars per unit interval of distance, which is dN/dr.\n\n    *   The problem, therefore, is to convert the density function from being a function of parallax to being a function of distance.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Relationships**\n    *   **The Chain Rule:** To convert a derivative from one variable to another (from `plx` to `r`), we use the chain rule of calculus:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n    *   **Parallax-Distance Relation:** The definition of parallax (plx) is its inverse relationship with distance (r). For simplicity, we can write:\n        `plx = 1/r`\n\n3.  **Execute the Calculation**\n    We need to find the two terms on the right side of the chain rule equation and then multiply them.\n\n    *   **First term: `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`**\n        We are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n        Substitute `plx = 1/r` into this expression:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    *   **Second term: `d(plx)/dr`**\n        We need to differentiate the parallax-distance relation with respect to `r`:\n        `plx = r⁻¹`\n        `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n    *   **Combine using the Chain Rule**\n        Now substitute these two results back into the chain rule formula:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²) `\n\n        For proportionality, we can ignore the negative sign (it just indicates that dN and dr have opposite signs in this formulation, which isn't relevant for the scaling relationship).\n        `dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * r⁻²`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to the cube of the distance (`r³`).\n\n5.  **Match with Options**\n    Comparing our result with the given choices:\n    A) ~ r³\n    B) ~ r²\n    C) ~ r⁵\n    D) ~ r⁴\n\n    Our result `~ r³` matches option A.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\nLet's think about a standard case. For a uniform distribution of stars in 3D space, the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r is `dN ∝ r² dr`, so `dN/dr ∝ r²`. Let's see what parallax dependence this implies. `dN/d(plx) = dN/dr * dr/d(plx)`. Since `r=1/plx`, `dr/d(plx) = -1/plx²`. So, `dN/d(plx) ∝ (r²) * (-1/plx²) = (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) ∝ plx⁻⁴`. So, `dN/dr ∝ r²` corresponds to `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁴`.\nIn our problem, `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`, which is a faster drop-off. This implies a non-uniform density. Following the same logic as the main derivation: `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-r⁻²) ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (-r⁻²) ∝ r⁵ * r⁻² ∝ r³`. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n<<<A>>>"
