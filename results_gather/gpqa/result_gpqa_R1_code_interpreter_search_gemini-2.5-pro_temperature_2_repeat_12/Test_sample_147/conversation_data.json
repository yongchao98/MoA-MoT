    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (let's call it YF_n_), and its mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is 31.96%. The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    where M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M_Y is the molar mass of element Y.\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for M_Y:\n    0.3196 = (19n) / (M_Y + 19n)\n    0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = 19n - 6.0724n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = 12.9276n\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can test integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find plausible molar masses for Y.\n    *   n = 1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (matches Sc, K, Ca, Ar - not ideal candidates for the described chemistry).\n    *   n = 2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (matches Br, Se - bromine forms BrF3, BrF5, but %F don't match).\n    *   n = 3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n = 4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (matches Dy).\n    *   n = 6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol (matches Pu).\n\n    Let's check the fluorine percentage for SbF3:\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    %F = (3 * 19.00 / 178.76) * 100 = 31.88%. This is an excellent match for the given 31.96%.\n    So, it is highly likely that **Y = Sb (Antimony)** and **A2 = SbF3 (Antimony trifluoride)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A3.**\n    A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) and it can interact with xenon. Antimony reacts with excess fluorine to form antimony pentafluoride (SbF5). SbF5 is a powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent known to react with xenon (e.g., `Xe + 2SbF5 → [XeF]+[Sb2F11]-`).\n    Therefore, **A3 = SbF5**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5.**\n    We are told that adding Y (Sb) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio produces A5. A4 must be one of the binary fluorides of antimony. The two common ones are SbF3 and SbF5. Both form colorless solutions. Let's analyze both possibilities for A4.\n\n    *   **Case 1: A4 = SbF5**. The reaction would be `Sb + SbF5 → A5`. This is a well-known comproportionation reaction to produce SbF3. The balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF5 → 5SbF3`. Here, A5 would be SbF3. The problem states that A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. SbF3 hydrolyzes in water to form antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF) (`SbF3 + H2O → SbOF + 2HF`), which perfectly fits the \"two substances\" description.\n        *   **Problem:** The stoichiometry of the reaction is 2:3, not 1:1 as stated in the problem. Also, let's calculate the molecular weight of A4=SbF5: M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fit into any of the provided answer ranges.\n\n    *   **Case 2: A4 = SbF3**.\n        Let's calculate the molecular weight of A4=SbF3: M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n        This value, 178.76 g/mol, falls squarely into the range **B) 160-180**. This provides a direct link to one of the answers.\n        *   **Problem:** The reaction `Sb + SbF3 → A5` is chemically unusual, as Sb(0) cannot readily react with Sb(III) in this manner. Furthermore, the likely product (a subfluoride like Sb2F3) would disproportionate in water to give at least three products (e.g., Sb, SbOF, HF), which contradicts the \"two substances\" clue.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    We face a contradiction.\n    *   The path where A4 = SbF5 has more consistent chemistry (reaction mechanism, decomposition of product) but is contradicted by both the stoichiometry and the molecular weight ranges in the answers.\n    *   The path where A4 = SbF3 is chemically problematic but leads to a molecular weight that perfectly matches one of the answer ranges.\n\n    In chemistry puzzles of this nature, it is common for some of the descriptive text (like stoichiometry or qualitative descriptions of reactions) to be simplified or even slightly inaccurate, while the numerical data (mass percentages, molecular weight ranges) are intended to be precise guides to the solution. The fact that M(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol fits perfectly in the 160-180 g/mol range is a very strong indication that this is the intended answer. Therefore, we conclude that **A4 is SbF3**.\n\n    The molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is ~178.76 g/mol. This value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>"
