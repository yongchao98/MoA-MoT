    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state and the uncertainty in its energy is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle states:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which corresponds to the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n2.  **Interpret the principle:** For an unstable state with a finite lifetime τ, its energy is not perfectly defined. There is an intrinsic \"smear\" or \"width\" to the energy level, given by ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. This is often called the natural linewidth.\n\n3.  **Establish the condition for resolution:** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly distinguished\" or \"resolved,\" the difference in their energies (|E1 - E2|) must be significantly larger than their combined energy widths. A standard criterion is that the separation must be greater than the sum of their individual widths:\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy width for each state:** We will use the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) for convenience: ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n    *   **For the first state (E1):**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For the second state (E2):**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Calculate the minimum required energy difference:** Now, apply the resolvability condition by summing the individual widths.\n    *   Required Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   Required Separation > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Required Separation > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   Required Separation > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    The energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The only energy difference large enough to allow the two energy levels to be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\nTo verify the calculations, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\nhbar_eV_s = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two quantum states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) for each state\n# based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (Delta_E approx hbar / tau)\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eV_s / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eV_s / tau2\n\n# For two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the difference between them\n# must be greater than the sum of their individual linewidths.\nminimum_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Linewidth of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Linewidth of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Sum of linewidths (ΔE1 + ΔE2): {minimum_energy_difference:.3e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nThe required energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the sum of the linewidths.\")\n\n# The options provided in the question\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-9,\n    'B': 1e-4,\n    'C': 1e-8,\n    'D': 1e-11\n}\n\n# Check which option satisfies the condition\nfor option_label, energy_value in options.items():\n    if energy_value > minimum_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {option_label}: {energy_value:.1e} eV is a possible energy difference as it is > {minimum_energy_difference:.3e} eV.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option_label}: {energy_value:.1e} eV is NOT a possible energy difference as it is <= {minimum_energy_difference:.3e} eV.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem is solved based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a quantum state (Δt) to the uncertainty or width of its energy level (ΔE).\n\n1.  **Uncertainty Principle:** The relationship is given by ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. For practical calculations, we can approximate this as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime of the state and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Calculate Energy Width (ΔE) for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolution:** To clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, the energy difference between them (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths. This ensures that the energy distributions (which are shaped like Lorentzian peaks) do not overlap too much.\n    *   Resolution Condition: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Difference:**\n    *   ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Compare with Given Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nThe only option that satisfies the condition for resolving the two energy levels is B.
