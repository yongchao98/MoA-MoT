    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Nature of Radioactive Decay:** Radioactive decay is a stochastic process governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. A key characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of a nucleus decaying in a given time interval is constant and does not depend on how long the nucleus has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability. The clock effectively \"resets\" at the 50-minute mark.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Decay Probability:** The probability of an atom surviving for a time `t`, P_survival(t), is given by an exponential function:\n    P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)\n    where `λ` is the decay constant for the specific atom.\n\n    Consequently, the probability of the atom decaying within a time `t`, P_decay(t), is:\n    P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom:** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    P_decay(100) = 0.32\n    This also tells us the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n    P_survival(100) = 1 - P_decay(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n    From the survival formula, we have:\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n4.  **Determine the Probability for the Required Interval:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because the process is memoryless, this is equivalent to asking for the probability that a brand-new atom of the same type will decay in 150 minutes.\n    We need to calculate P_decay(150).\n    P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability using the Known Value:** We can calculate `e^(-λ * 150)` without explicitly solving for `λ`. We can use the property of exponents: a^(x*y) = (a^x)^y.\n    e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\n    We already know that e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68. Substituting this value in:\n    e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n    Now, we can find the decay probability:\n    P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n    P_decay(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\n    Converting this probability to a percentage:\n    0.4393 * 100% = 43.93%\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated probability is 43.93%. The available options are:\n    A) 44%\n    B) 40%\n    C) 48%\n    D) 52%\n\n    The value 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\nBased on the reasoning and calculation from the Python script's output (`43.93%`), the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
