    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare two phenomena that cause a dip in a star's observed brightness:\n*   **Rotational Modulation:** A star with a large, cool spot region rotates. When the spotty face is visible, the star appears dimmer than when the unspotted face is visible. The amplitude of this brightness change is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** An exoplanet passes in front of its star, blocking a fraction of its light. The amount of light blocked is the transit depth.\n\nWe need to find the size of a hypothetical planet (relative to its star) that would cause a transit depth equal to the amplitude of the rotational modulation from the starspots.\n\n**2. Model the Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n\nWe'll use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux (energy emitted per unit area) from a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (Flux ∝ T⁴). We will model the visible face of the star as a flat disk.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the bright, unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature T_eff.\n    *   F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff⁴\n    where A_disk is the projected area of the stellar disk.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the hemisphere covered in spots is facing the observer. This disk is a mix of two temperatures: the normal photosphere (T_eff) and the cooler spots (T_spot).\n    *   The filling factor `f_spot` is 0.20 (or 20%), meaning 20% of this hemisphere's area is covered by spots.\n    *   The remaining 80% (1 - f_spot) is normal photosphere.\n    *   The total flux is a weighted average: F_min ∝ A_disk * [ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴ ]\n\n**3. Calculate the Amplitude of the Rotational Modulation**\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is the fractional change in flux between the maximum and minimum brightness. It's standard to normalize by the maximum flux.\n\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 2:\nAmplitude = 1 - ( A_disk * [ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴ ] ) / ( A_disk * T_eff⁴ )\n\nCancel `A_disk` and simplify:\nAmplitude = 1 - [ (1 - f_spot) + f_spot * (T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴) ]\nAmplitude = 1 - 1 + f_spot - f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\nAmplitude = f_spot * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n*   Star effective temperature, T_eff = 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature, T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Spot filling factor, f_spot = 20% = 0.20\n\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]\nAmplitude = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\n\n**4. Model the Exoplanet Transit Depth**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits a star, it blocks an amount of light proportional to its area relative to the star's area. The transit depth (the fractional dip in brightness) is given by:\n\nTransit Depth = (Area of planet disk) / (Area of star disk)\nTransit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\nTransit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**5. Equate the Signals and Solve**\n\nThe problem requires the transit depth to be equal to the amplitude of the rotational modulation.\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\n\nNow, let's perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nT_eff = 6000.0  # K\ndelta_T = 1000.0 # K\nf_spot = 0.20   # 20% filling factor\n\n# Calculate spot temperature\nT_spot = T_eff - delta_T\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of rotational modulation\n# Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\namplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The transit depth is (R_pl / R_star)**2\n# We set the transit depth equal to the modulation amplitude\n# (R_pl / R_star)**2 = amplitude\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude)\nrelative_radius = np.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) is: {relative_radius:.4f}\")\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nThe calculated relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) is: 0.3218\n```\n\nThe calculated value for the relative radius, R_pl / R_star, is approximately 0.3218.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To produce the same amplitude signal as the rotational modulation, a hypothetical exoplanet would need to have a radius of approximately 0.32 times the radius of its host star.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the relative flux change due to starspots:**\n    The brightness of a star is proportional to its flux (F), which follows the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴, where T is the effective temperature).\n\n    *   When the unspotted hemisphere faces us (maximum brightness, F_max), the flux is proportional to `T_eff⁴`.\n    *   When the spotted hemisphere faces us (minimum brightness, F_min), 20% of the surface is at `T_spot` (5000 K) and 80% is at `T_eff` (6000 K). The total flux is a weighted average: `F_min ∝ 0.80 * T_eff⁴ + 0.20 * T_spot⁴`.\n\n    The fractional change in flux (amplitude) is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    This simplifies to `1 - F_min / F_max`, which gives:\n    Amplitude = `1 - (0.80 * 6000⁴ + 0.20 * 5000⁴) / 6000⁴`\n    Amplitude = `1 - 0.80 - 0.20 * (5000/6000)⁴`\n    Amplitude = `0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n    Amplitude ≈ `0.20 * (1 - 0.4822)`\n    Amplitude ≈ `0.1035`\n\n2.  **Calculate the required exoplanet size for an equivalent signal:**\n    When a planet transits a star, the depth of the light curve dip is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = `(π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`.\n\n3.  **Equate the two effects:**\n    We set the transit depth equal to the amplitude of the rotational modulation:\n    `(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.1035`\n\n    Now, we solve for the relative radius (`R_pl / R_star`):\n    `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.1035)`\n    `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
