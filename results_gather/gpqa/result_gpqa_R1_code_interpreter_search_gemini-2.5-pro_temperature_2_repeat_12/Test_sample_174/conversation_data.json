    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The nature of this radiation can be characterized by a multipole expansion. The lowest and typically dominant orders of radiation are electric dipole, magnetic dipole, and electric quadrupole.\n\n1.  **Determining the Radiation Pattern and the Power Fraction**\n\n    The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroid shape, symmetric around the z-axis. An oscillation of charge along this axis (e.g., charge separating towards the poles of the spheroid and then reversing) will create a time-varying electric dipole moment **p** along the z-axis. This is the most fundamental mode of radiation for such a system.\n\n    For an oscillating electric dipole along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle with respect to the z-axis, and C is a constant that depends on the dipole moment amplitude, frequency, and fundamental constants.\n\n    The radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. This occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis), where `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n    The problem states that this maximum radiated power is A.\n    So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n\n    We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n    `(dP/dΩ) at 30° = C * sin²(30°)`\n\n    Since `A = C`, we have:\n    `(dP/dΩ) at 30° = A * sin²(30°)`\n\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n    So, the power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `A * (1/4) = A/4`.\n    The fraction of the maximum power A is **1/4**.\n\n    This narrows down the possible options to A and B.\n\n2.  **Determining the Wavelength Dependence**\n\n    The function `f` representing the radiated power per unit solid angle depends on the wavelength `λ`. Let's look at the full expression for electric dipole radiation:\n    `dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)` (in SI units, where p₀ is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment)\n\n    The key dependence here is on the angular frequency `ω`. The power is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n    Therefore, the power dependence on wavelength is:\n    `P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\n    So, a possible functional form for `f` includes a factor of `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n    *Note on other multipoles*: If the source were an electric quadrupole, the power dependence would be `P ∝ ω⁶ ∝ λ⁻⁶`, and the angular distribution would be `∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`. This would lead to a fraction of 3/4 at 30°, corresponding to option C. However, an electric dipole is the most common and lowest-order radiation from a compact source, and it's the most natural interpretation of \"an oscillating charge distribution\" in a spheroid without further symmetries specified.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**\n\n    Combining our findings:\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n    *   The radiated power is proportional to **λ⁻⁴**.\n\n    These two results match option B.\n\n    Let's confirm the fraction calculation with a simple script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# In the case of dipole radiation, the power is proportional to sin(theta)^2.\n# The maximum power is at theta = 90 degrees.\n# We want to find the fraction of the maximum power at theta = 30 degrees.\n\n# Convert angles to radians\ntheta_30 = np.deg2rad(30)\ntheta_90 = np.deg2rad(90)\n\n# Calculate the sine squared values\npower_at_30 = np.sin(theta_30)**2\nmax_power = np.sin(theta_90)**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction\nfraction = power_at_30 / max_power\n\nprint(f\"The fraction of the maximum power at 30 degrees is: {fraction}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe fraction of the maximum power at 30 degrees is: 0.25\n<<<\nThe code confirms that the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4. Based on the analysis of the dipole radiation model, which is the most appropriate for the described physical system, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An oscillating spheroid-shaped charge distribution along its symmetry axis (the z-axis) creates a time-varying electric dipole moment. This system acts as an electric dipole antenna.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nFor an oscillating electric dipole aligned with the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation.\n\nThe radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the axis of oscillation).\n\nThe problem states that this maximum radiated power is A.\nSo, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * (1)² = C`.\n\nWe are asked to find the fraction of the maximum power that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We calculate the power at this angle:\n\n`(dP/dΩ)_at_30° = C * sin²(30°)`\n\nSince `A = C`, we have:\n\n`(dP/dΩ)_at_30° = A * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`. Therefore:\n\n`sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nSo, the power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `A * (1/4) = A/4`.\nThe fraction of the maximum power A is **1/4**.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe radiated power `P` from an oscillating dipole is described by the Larmor formula, which shows that the power is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the charge. For an oscillation with angular frequency `ω`, the position is `z(t) ~ cos(ωt)`, velocity is `v(t) ~ -ωsin(ωt)`, and acceleration is `a(t) ~ -ω²cos(ωt)`.\n\nTherefore, the radiated power is proportional to the square of the amplitude of acceleration:\n\n`P ∝ (a_max)² ∝ (ω²)² = ω⁴`\n\nThe power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ)`, will also have this frequency dependence. The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the equation `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for power:\n\n`P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, a possible form for the function `f` is one that is proportional to **λ⁻⁴**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two results:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The radiated power has a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
