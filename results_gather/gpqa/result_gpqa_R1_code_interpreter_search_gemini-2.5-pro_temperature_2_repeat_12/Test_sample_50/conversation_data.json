    "This problem can be solved using the method of images, a fundamental technique in electrostatics for problems involving charges and conductors.\n\n**1. The Method of Images**\n\nThe electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere are the same as if the sphere were replaced by a specific \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (since it is grounded).\n\n*   **System:** A point charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is grounded (V=0).\n*   **Equivalent System:** The real charge `q` and an image charge `q'` located at a distance `d'` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (d')**\n\nFor a grounded sphere of radius `R` and a point charge `q` at distance `d` from its center, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is located inside the sphere (`d' < R` since `d > R`), and it has the opposite sign to the real charge `q`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy (U)**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. As the charge `q` is brought closer, it induces charges on the sphere. The potential energy is the interaction energy between the charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere.\n\nA key result from electrostatic theory is that the interaction energy `U` between a point charge and a conductor is half the product of the charge and the potential at its location due to the induced charges. The potential from the induced charges is identical to the potential from the image charge.\n\n*   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nWhere `V_induced` is the potential at the position of the real charge `q` created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nLet's calculate `V_induced`:\n\n*   The image charge `q'` is at a distance `d'` from the center.\n*   The real charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n*   The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `(d - d')`.\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` is:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n\n`V_induced = k * [ - (R/d) * q ] / [ d - (R^2/d) ]`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n`d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * [ - (R/d) * q ] / [ (d^2 - R^2) / d ]`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n`V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, we can calculate the potential energy `U` using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result is negative, which makes physical sense. The charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere (due to the opposite-signed induced charges), so the potential energy of the system decreases as the charge is brought in from infinity.\n\n**4. Comparing with the Options**\n\n*   A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n*   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur calculated result `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option C perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
