    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. This means it has a large number of free-moving electrons, but the total positive charge from the atomic nuclei is balanced by the total negative charge of the electrons.\n\n2.  **Placing a charge inside the cavity:** A positive charge, `+q`, is introduced into the cavity. This charge will exert an attractive force on the free electrons within the conductor.\n\n3.  **Induction on the inner surface:** In response to the `+q` charge, free electrons from the conductor will be drawn towards the cavity and will accumulate on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This creates a net negative charge on the inner surface. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface entirely within the material of the conductor that encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero (as it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the field to be zero, the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the total charge induced on the inner surface must be exactly `-q` to cancel out the `+q` charge placed inside. The distribution of this `-q` charge on the inner surface will not be uniform; it will be arranged to precisely cancel the electric field produced by `+q` in the region of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Induction on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` (from the free electrons) has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding deficit of electrons is created elsewhere in the conductor. This results in a net positive charge appearing on the conductor. Since these positive charges are free to move on the conductor's surface and they repel each other, they will move as far apart as possible, which means they will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor. The total charge on this outer surface must be `+q` to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor (`-q` on the inner surface + `+q` on the outer surface = 0 net induced charge).\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage):** A key principle of electrostatics is that a closed conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges inside it. In our case, the conductor acts as a shield. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced *only* by the charges on the outer surface. The fields from the original charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface perfectly cancel each other out for all points outside the cavity.\n\n6.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:** The charge `+q` is on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. Because this surface is a sphere and is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of charges within the cavity, and there are no other external electric fields, the `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n7.  **Calculating the external electric field:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at a point outside the shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude placed at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer sphere is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is `L`.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The other parameters given in the problem, such as the radius of the cavity `r`, the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta`, are irrelevant for determining the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are extra information designed to test the understanding of the shielding principle. The correct expression for the electric field at point P depends only on the net charge that appears on the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
