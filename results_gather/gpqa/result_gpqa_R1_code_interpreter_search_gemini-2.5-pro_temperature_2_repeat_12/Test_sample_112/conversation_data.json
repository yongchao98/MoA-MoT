    "*   **Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H bond stretch, specifically within a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O) stretch. This value is typical for the C=O in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an alkene (C=C) double bond stretch.\n    *   Putting this together, the FTIR data suggests the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for vinyl hydrogens directly confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C). Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and strong indicator for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n*   **Synthesis of Information and Evaluation of Molecular Formulas:**\n    1.  The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen.\n    2.  We are left with C) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2. To distinguish between them, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), also known as double bond equivalents. The formula for DBE is: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    3.  From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the carbonyl (C=O) in the carboxylic acid and one for the alkene (C=C). So, we are looking for a formula with a DBE of 2.\n    4.  Let's calculate the DBE for the remaining options:\n        *   For C) C6H12O2: DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula only accounts for one double bond (or a ring), which would fit a saturated carboxylic acid, but not one that also contains an alkene.\n        *   For D) C6H10O2: DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This DBE of 2 perfectly matches our findings: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The combined spectroscopic evidence (carboxylic acid + alkene) requires a molecular formula with two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2. Only C6H10O2 fits all the criteria. An example of such a compound would be hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
