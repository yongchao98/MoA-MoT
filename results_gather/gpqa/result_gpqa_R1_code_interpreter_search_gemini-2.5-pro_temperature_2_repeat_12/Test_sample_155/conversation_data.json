    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the HPLC analyses:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        H       Pr\n         \\     /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n        Pr      H      (Pr = propyl, -CH2CH2CH3)\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation on the alkene. The reaction is a *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom. Since the starting material is a *trans*-alkene, the product is a *trans*-epoxide. As the starting alkene is achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** The epoxide ring is opened by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. This is an Sₙ2-like reaction where water acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the protonated epoxide's carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond. This results in an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** The overall process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. There is a general rule in stereochemistry: the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Starting with (E)-oct-4-ene, the anti-addition of two -OH groups produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n          Pr      Pr\n           \\     /\n            C = C\n           /     \\\n          H       H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺), resulting in *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** The stereochemical rule for *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is that it produces a *meso* compound (if the alkene is symmetrical, which it is).\n    *   A meso compound contains chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Note that (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) describe the same meso molecule because of its symmetry.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** The single, achiral, meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n3.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and meso-diol are **diastereomers**.\n*   (4S,5S)-diol and meso-diol are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore *cannot* be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture:\n        *   The enantiomeric pair, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will co-elute as **Peak 1**.\n        *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, appearing as **Peak 2**.\n    *   **Observation:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times and their separation.\n    *   Diastereomers are also readily separated by this technique.\n    *   In our mixture, all three unique stereoisomers will be separated:\n        *   **(4R,5R)-diol** will elute as **Peak 1**.\n        *   **(4S,5S)-diol** will elute as **Peak 2**.\n        *   **meso-diol** will elute as **Peak 3**.\n    *   **Observation:** The chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
