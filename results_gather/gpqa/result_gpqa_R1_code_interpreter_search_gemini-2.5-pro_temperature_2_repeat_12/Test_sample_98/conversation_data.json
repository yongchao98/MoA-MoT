    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n1.  **Very broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadening is a hallmark of this functional group.\n2.  **Strong absorption at ~1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position (1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but doesn't distinguish between the options yet.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe key to identifying the specific structure lies in the complex splitting patterns observed in the 1H NMR spectrum. The multiplicity of a proton signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) following the n+1 rule. For a proton coupled to multiple, different sets of neighboring protons (n₁, n₂, n₃...), the signal is split into a \"multiplet of multiplets,\" with a total of (n₁+1)(n₂+1)(n₃+1)... lines.\n\n1.  **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to one neighboring proton (1H).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to a set of two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Indicates coupling to a set of three neighboring protons (a CH₃ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be a single proton (a CH group) that is adjacent to three different groups: another CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n\n2.  **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to one neighboring proton (1H).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to a set of two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Another triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to a second, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (another CH₂ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be a single proton (a CH group) that is adjacent to three different groups: another CH group, one CH₂ group, and a second, chemically different CH₂ group.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's interpret the condensed formulas as linear chains and analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons on the main chain.\n\n*   **A) 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid:** `CH₃-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-COOH`\n    *   Let's label the main chain carbons starting from the COOH group: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Is coupled to H-2 (1H, gives doublet), CH₂-4 (2H, gives triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). This proton's signal would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **H-2:** Is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives doublet) and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). Its signal would be a `dt`.\n    *   This structure gives a `dtt` signal but **lacks a proton that would give a `dtq` signal**. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid:** `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   Let's label the main chain: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Is coupled to H-4 (1H, gives doublet), CH₂-2 (2H, gives triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). This proton's signal would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **H-4:** Is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives doublet), CH₃-5 (3H, gives quartet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). This proton's signal would be a **dqt** (doublet of quartets of triplets), which has the same components as a `dtq`. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **This structure provides protons that account for BOTH the `dtt` and the `dtq` signals.** Therefore, B is a very strong candidate.\n\n*   **C) 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid:** `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   Let's label the main chain: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Is coupled to H-4 (1H, gives doublet), CH₂-2 (2H, gives triplet), and the C3-methyl group (3H, gives quartet). This proton's signal would be a **dqt**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **H-4:** Is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives doublet) and two methyl groups (CH₃-5 and the C4-methyl). These 6 protons would likely split H-4 into a septet. The overall signal would be a `d-sept` or a more complex multiplet if the methyls are non-equivalent (`dqq`), but not a `dtt`.\n    *   This structure gives a `dtq` signal but **lacks a proton that would give a `dtt` signal**. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid:** `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n    *   Let's label the main chain: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Is coupled to H-2 (1H, gives doublet), CH₂-4 (2H, gives triplet), and the C3-methyl group (3H, gives quartet). This proton's signal would be a **dqt**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **H-2:** Is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives doublet) and the C2-methyl group (3H, gives quartet). Its signal would be a `dq`.\n    *   This structure gives a `dtq` signal but **lacks a proton that would give a `dtt` signal**. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid (**Option B**) has protons in the correct chemical environments to produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (H-3) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (H-4).\n\n<<<B>>>"
