    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with one equivalent of bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone. The bromine atom substitutes one of the alpha-hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   Starting material: Cyclohexanone\n*   Reaction: α-bromination\n*   **Product 1: 2-bromocyclohexanone**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis is a classic example of the Favorskii rearrangement. An α-halo ketone with an α'-proton (a proton on the other side of the carbonyl group) reacts with a strong base to form a carboxylic acid derivative. For cyclic α-halo ketones, this rearrangement proceeds with ring contraction.\n\n1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) acts as a base and removes an α'-proton from C6 of the 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n2.  An enolate is formed, which then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction. The carbanion at C6 attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a strained bicyclic intermediate: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one.\n3.  The hydroxide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of the bicyclic intermediate.\n4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the strained cyclopropane ring opens. This process involves the cleavage of a C-C bond to form a more stable carbanion, resulting in a five-membered ring.\n5.  After an acidic workup (which is implicit in this type of problem), the resulting carboxylate and carbanion are protonated.\n\nThe net result of the Favorskii rearrangement on 2-bromocyclohexanone is the contraction of the six-membered ring to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   Starting material: 2-bromocyclohexanone\n*   Reaction: Favorskii rearrangement (with ring contraction)\n*   **Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   Starting material: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   Reaction: Carboxylic acid to acid chloride conversion\n*   **Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n\n*   Starting material: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   Reaction: Selective reduction of an acid chloride to an aldehyde\n*   **Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. We need to determine the number of unique proton environments in this molecule, which corresponds to the number of signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a five-membered ring with a -CHO group attached.\n```\n      H(a)\n      |\n    O=C\n      |\n   H(b)-C1\n      /   \\\n(c,d)H2C2---C5H2(c,d)\n     |     |\n(e,f)H2C3---C4H2(e,f)\n```\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogens, we look at the molecule's symmetry. Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the C1 carbon and its attached hydrogen, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\n1.  **H(a): Aldehyde Proton**: The single proton attached to the carbonyl carbon is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **H(b): C1 Proton**: The single proton on the carbon where the aldehyde group is attached (C1) is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **C2 and C5 Protons**: Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are chemically equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by symmetry or rotation because of the prochiral center at C1). Similarly for C5. The 'cis' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'cis' proton on C5, and the 'trans' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'trans' proton on C5. Thus, the four protons on these two carbons give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n4.  **C3 and C4 Protons**: Due to the plane of symmetry, C3 and C4 are chemically equivalent. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. By the same logic as for C2/C5, the four protons on C3 and C4 give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n\nTotaling the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
