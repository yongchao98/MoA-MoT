    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe primary goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Write Down the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a black body heated only by its parent star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_eff_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nwhere:\n*   T_eff_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to calculate the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 = T_eff_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))\nT_eq2 = T_eff_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n\nBy dividing the first equation by the second, we get:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_eff_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so T_eff_star and R_star are the same) and that they have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a_1)) * ((2 * a_2) / R_star))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a_2 / a_1.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observable Quantities**\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's light caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. For a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K_star) is given by:\n\nK_star = (M_p / M_star) * v_p * sin(i)\n\nwhere:\n*   M_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   v_p is the planet's orbital velocity, given by v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a) (assuming M_p << M_star).\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\nSubstituting v_p into the equation for K_star:\n\nK_star = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) * sin(i)\nK_star = (M_p * sin(i) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\nThe problem states the planets were detected by the transit method as well. Transits are only observable when the orbit is nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination `i` is very close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1. We can therefore assume sin(i) = 1 for both planets. The equation simplifies to:\n\nK_star ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nNow, we solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\nK_star^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\na = G * M_p^2 / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\n\na_2 / a_1 = [G * M_p2^2 / (M_star * K_star2^2)] / [G * M_p1^2 / (M_star * K_star1^2)]\n\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / M_p1^2)\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\n**6. Calculate the Necessary Ratios from the Given Data**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n    M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K_star1 / K_star2):**\n    The radial velocity `v_r` is related to the Doppler shift `Δλ` by: v_r / c = Δλ / λ₀.\n    The maximum RV, K_star, is proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ_max`.\n    K_star = c * (Δλ_max / λ₀)\n    So, K_star1 / K_star2 = (c * Δλ_1 / λ₀) / (c * Δλ_2 / λ₀) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.\n\n    Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n    K_star1 / K_star2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**7. Compute the Final Ratios**\n\n*   **Ratio a_2 / a_1:**\n    a_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n*   **Ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the final numerical answer, we perform the division.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is given by T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes is given by a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\n# Planetary mass ratio M_p2 / M_p1\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = 5 / 7\n\n# RV semi-amplitude ratio K_star1 / K_star2, which is equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\nrv_ratio_1_over_2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Calculate a_2 / a_1\nsemi_major_axis_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio_2_over_1)**2 * (rv_ratio_1_over_2)**2\n\n# Calculate the equilibrium temperature ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2\nequilibrium_temp_ratio = math.sqrt(semi_major_axis_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(equilibrium_temp_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 0.5357. This value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet ($T_{eq}$) is determined by its distance from the star, the star's properties, and the planet's albedo. The formula is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_s}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_s$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2, which is $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$.\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_s}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_s}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{eff}$ and $R_s$ are the same and cancel out. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$, and the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ terms cancel out.\n\nThe simplified ratio becomes:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. We can find this from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude (K) induced by a planet is given by:\n\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_s^{2/3}}$\n\nUsing Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$), this can be rewritten in terms of the semi-major axis, 'a'. A more direct formula relating K, a, and mass is:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_s} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_s}{a}}$ (for $M_p << M_s$)\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_s}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$ (assuming $sin i \\approx 1$)\n\nThe problem states that the planets were also detected by the transit method, which implies that their orbits are seen nearly edge-on. Therefore, we can assume the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, and thus $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n\nLet's solve the equation for 'a':\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_s} \\frac{G}{a}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_s K^2}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_s K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_s K_1^2)} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2 K_2^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) through the formula $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$. Therefore, the ratio of the K values is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nGiven values from the problem:\n*   $M_{p1}$ = 7 Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2}$ = 5 Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1$ = 0.03 Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2$ = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, let's compute the ratios:\n*   $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, plug these into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
