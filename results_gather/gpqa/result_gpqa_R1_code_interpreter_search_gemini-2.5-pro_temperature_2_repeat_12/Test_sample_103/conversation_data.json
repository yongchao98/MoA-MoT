    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to find the ratio of the orbital periods ($T_2 / T_1$) of two exoplanets. I am given information about their host stars, their own masses, and the spectroscopic data used to detect them (Radial Velocity method).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Provided Data:**\n    *   Star masses are equal: $M_{star,1} = M_{star,2}$.\n    *   Planet masses are equal: $M_{planet,1} = M_{planet,2}$.\n    *   Orbits are circular.\n    *   The detection is via the Radial Velocity (RV) method, which measures wavelength shifts ($\\Delta \\lambda$).\n    *   Maximum wavelength shift for planet 1: $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms.\n    *   Maximum wavelength shift for planet 2: $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n\n3.  **Relate Observations to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The RV method relies on the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_{rad}$). The formula is $\\Delta \\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_{rad} / c$.\n    *   The *maximum* wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the *maximum* radial velocity, which is the amplitude of the RV curve, denoted as $K$.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the maximum wavelength shifts is equal to the ratio of the RV amplitudes:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ mÅ}}{5 \\text{ mÅ}} = 1.4$\n\n4.  **Connect RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T):**\n    *   I need a formula that links $K$ and $T$. Let's derive it from first principles.\n    *   For a planet in a circular orbit, the velocity of the star ($v_{star}$) around the common center of mass is given by the conservation of momentum: $M_{star} v_{star} = M_{planet} v_{planet}$.\n    *   The planet's orbital velocity is $v_{planet} = \\frac{2\\pi a}{T}$, where 'a' is the orbital radius and 'T' is the orbital period.\n    *   So, $v_{star} = \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} v_{planet} = \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} \\frac{2\\pi a}{T}$.\n    *   The observed RV amplitude is $K = v_{star} \\sin(i)$, where 'i' is the inclination of the orbit. A standard assumption in such problems, unless stated otherwise, is that the system is viewed edge-on ($i=90^\\circ, \\sin(i)=1$), which gives the maximum possible signal. I will proceed with this assumption.\n        $K = \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} \\frac{2\\pi a}{T}$.\n    *   Now, I need to relate the orbital radius 'a' to the period 'T'.

    "The user wants me to solve an astrophysics problem. I will break down the problem and use the relevant physics equations to find the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe goal is to find the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets ($T_2 / T_1$).\n\n**2. List the Given Information:**\n*   **Host Stars:** The masses are equal ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$).\n*   **Exoplanets:** The masses are equal ($M_{p1} = M_{p2}$).\n*   **Orbits:** Both are circular.\n*   **Detection Method:** Radial Velocity (RV), which measures the Doppler shift of spectral lines.\n*   **Measurement for Planet 1:** Maximum wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms.\n*   **Measurement for Planet 2:** Maximum wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n\n**3. Relate Observations to Physical Quantities:**\nThe radial velocity method relies on the Doppler effect. The observed shift in a spectral line's wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$). The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted by $K$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum wavelength shifts:\n$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $\n\n**4. Find the Relationship Between RV Amplitude ($K$) and Orbital Period ($T$):**\nWe need a formula that connects $K$ and $T$. Let's derive it.\nFor a circular orbit (and assuming we are viewing it edge-on, i.e., inclination $i=90°$, for maximum signal), the RV amplitude $K$ is the orbital velocity of the star ($v_s$). From the conservation of momentum for the two-body system:\n$ M_p v_p = M_s v_s $\nwhere $M_p$ and $v_p$ are the planet's mass and velocity, and $M_s$ and $v_s$ are the star's mass and velocity.\n\nSo, $K = v_s = \\frac{M_p}{M_s} v_p$.\n\nThe planet's orbital velocity is $v_p = \\frac{2\\pi a}{T}$, where 'a' is the orbital radius and 'T' is the orbital period.\n$K = \\frac{M_p}{M_s} \\frac{2\\pi a}{T}$.\n\nNow, we use Kepler's Third Law to relate 'a' and 'T'. For a planet whose mass is much smaller than its star ($M_p \\ll M_s$), the law simplifies to:\n$ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_s} a^3 $\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nLet's solve for 'a':\n$ a = \\left( \\frac{G M_s T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} $\n\nNow, substitute this expression for 'a' back into our equation for $K$:\n$ K = \\frac{M_p}{M_s} \\frac{2\\pi}{T} \\left( \\frac{G M_s T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} $\n\nTo see the relationship, let's group the terms:\n$ K = \\frac{M_p (2\\pi) (G M_s)^{1/3} T^{2/3}}{M_s T (4\\pi^2)^{1/3}} = \\frac{M_p (2\\pi) (G M_s)^{1/3}}{M_s (2\\pi)^{2/3}} \\frac{T^{2/3}}{T} $\n$ K \\propto \\frac{M_p M_s^{1/3}}{M_s} T^{-1/3} = M_p M_s^{-2/3} T^{-1/3} $\n\nSo, the key proportionality is: $ K \\propto T^{-1/3} $ (since $M_p$ and $M_s$ are constants for both systems).\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Periods:**\nWe can now write the relationship between the two systems:\n$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $\n\nWe want to find $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$.

    "The user has asked the same question again. I will re-evaluate my reasoning to ensure it is sound and provide a clear, step-by-step solution.\n\n**1. Deconstruction and Analysis of the Problem**\nThe core task is to determine the ratio of the orbital periods ($T_2/T_1$) for two exoplanets.\n\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   Star Masses: Equal ($M_{s,1} = M_{s,2}$)\n    *   Planet Masses: Equal ($M_{p,1} = M_{p,2}$, described as \"similar to Neptune\")\n    *   Orbits: Circular\n    *   Detection Method: Radial Velocity (RV)\n    *   Wavelength Shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$): 5 miliangstroms\n    *   Wavelength Shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$): 7 miliangstroms\n\n**2. Connecting Observations to Physics**\nThe RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's light caused by its \"wobble\" as a planet orbits it. The maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity, which is the semi-amplitude of the velocity curve, denoted as $K$.\n\nSo, we can establish the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} $$\n\n**3. Deriving the Relationship between RV Semi-Amplitude (K) and Period (T)**\nWe need to find a formula linking $K$ and $T$.\nThe RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n$$ K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_s} v_p $$\nwhere $M_p$ and $M_s$ are the planet and star masses, $i$ is the orbital inclination (assumed to be the same and non-zero for both systems), and $v_p$ is the planet's orbital velocity. This equation comes from the conservation of momentum ($M_s v_s = M_p v_p$, and $K = v_s \\sin i$).\n\nThe planet's orbital velocity for a circular orbit is $v_p = \\frac{2\\pi a}{T}$, where $a$ is the orbital semi-major axis (radius for a circle) and $T$ is the orbital period.\n\nKepler's Third Law states $T^2 \\propto a^3$. More specifically, $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_s + M_p)}a^3$. Since the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's ($M_p \\ll M_s$), we can approximate this to $T^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_s}$.\n\nLet's express everything in terms of $T$ to find the relationship we need.\nFrom Kepler's Law, $a \\propto (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$.\nNow, substitute this into the equation for the planet's velocity:\n$$ v_p = \\frac{2\\pi a}{T} \\propto \\frac{a}{T} \\propto \\frac{(M_s T^2)^{1/3}}{T} \\propto M_s^{1/3} T^{-1/3} $$\nNow substitute this relationship for $v_p$ back into the formula for $K$:\n$$ K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{M_s} v_p \\propto \\frac{M_p}{M_s} M_s^{1/3} T^{-1/3} \\propto M_p M_s^{-2/3} T^{-1/3} $$\nSince we are told that the masses of the stars ($M_s$) are the same and the masses of the planets ($M_p$) are the same for both systems, this simplifies the proportionality to:\n$$ K \\propto T^{-1/3} $$\n\n**4. Solving for the Ratio of Periods**\nNow we can set up the ratio for our two systems:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nWe want to find $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$.

    "The problem asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 ($T_2/T_1$). Let's break down the physics involved.\n\n1.  **Relating Observation to Star Velocity:** The detection is done using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The measured wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) due to the Doppler effect. The maximum shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is the RV semi-amplitude, $K$. Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the maximum wavelength shifts.\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relating RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T):** The RV semi-amplitude $K$ for a star with a planet in a circular orbit can be expressed as:\n    $$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_s^{2/3}} $$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_s$ is the star mass, $T$ is the orbital period, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Establishing Proportionality:** In this problem, we are told that the star masses are the same ($M_{s,1}=M_{s,2}$) and the planet masses are the same ($M_{p,1}=M_{p,2}$). We assume the viewing inclination $i$ is the same for a valid comparison. Therefore, most terms in the equation are constant for both systems, and we can establish a simple proportionality:\n    $$ K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad K \\propto T^{-1/3} $$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now use this proportionality to relate the two systems:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{T_1^{-1/3}}{T_2^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n    We want to find the ratio $T_2/T_1$.

    "The reasoning and calculation leading to the answer are robust. Let's walk through it one more time with a focus on the core physical concepts.\n\n1.  **Interpreting the Data:** The measured wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is a direct measure of the star's maximum speed (its \"wobble\") along our line of sight. This speed is called the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n    *   Star 1 has a shift of 5 units, so let's say $K_1 = 5$.\n    *   Star 2 has a shift of 7 units, so let's say $K_2 = 7$.\n    *   This tells us that **Star 2 is moving faster than Star 1**.\n\n2.  **Connecting Star Speed to the Planet's Orbit:** What makes a star wobble faster? For a given star mass and planet mass, the star's speed is dictated by the planet's orbit. The force of gravity is stronger at smaller distances, causing the planet to orbit much faster when it's closer to the star. Due to the conservation of momentum, a faster-orbiting planet forces the star to also move faster in its smaller corresponding orbit.\n    *   **Key Concept:** A faster star wobble implies the planet has a shorter orbital period.\n    *   Since Star 2 is moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$), Planet 2 must have a **shorter orbital period** ($T_2 < T_1$).\n    *   This means the ratio we are looking for, $T_2/T_1$, must be less than 1. This eliminates options A (~1.96) and C (~1.40).\n\n3.  **The Precise Relationship:** The precise physical relationship, derived from Kepler's Laws and the conservation of momentum, is that the star's speed ($K$) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's period ($T$).\n    $$ K \\propto T^{-1/3} $$\n\n4.  **Calculation:** We can write this proportionality as a ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    We want to find $T_2/T_1$, so we must rearrange the formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n    Now, we plug in the values from the problem ($K_1/K_2 = 5/7$):\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n    The calculation gives:\n    $$ \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.36443 $$\n    This value matches your provided code output. It is approximately 0.36.\n\nOf the choices given, this value is represented by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
