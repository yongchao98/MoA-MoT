    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product.\n\n### **Part 1: Identify the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the structure of the initial compound using its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring (e.g., C=O, C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (9-10 ppm) is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. The splitting is a triplet (t), which means it's adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a signal for 2 protons. The splitting is a doublet (d), meaning it's adjacent to a carbon with 1 proton (a CH group). This confirms the presence of a **-CH2-CHO** fragment, as the CH2 protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (less than 7 ppm), which indicates the ring is attached to an electron-donating group (EDG).\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to 2 exchangeable protons. Given the nitrogen in the molecular formula, this is very likely a primary **amine group (-NH2)**. An amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    *   A -CH2-CHO group\n    *   An -NH2 group\n    *   A benzene ring to which these two groups are attached in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\n    The structure of the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) -> C = 6+2 = 8; H = 4+2+2+1 = 9; N=1; O=1. Formula C8H9NO is correct.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, we subject 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde to the given series of reactions.\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n    *   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   **Step 1 (NaNO2 + HCl at 0-5°C): Diazotization.** The primary amine group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   **Step 2 (H2O, heat): Hydrolysis.** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water to replace the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting the intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with alpha-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). Such aldehydes undergo an **aldol condensation** reaction in the presence of base and heat.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a. **Enolate Formation:** The base (OH⁻) removes an alpha-hydrogen from one molecule to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        b. **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        c. **Aldol Addition:** Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n        d. **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. An alpha-hydrogen and the beta-hydroxyl group are removed to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n    *   **Final Product Formation:**\n        The aldol addition product dehydrates to form a double bond between the alpha (C2) and beta (C3) carbons.\n\n         \n\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Part 3: Match with Options**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; it's not a dimerization product.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This structure matches the final product of the aldol condensation reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
