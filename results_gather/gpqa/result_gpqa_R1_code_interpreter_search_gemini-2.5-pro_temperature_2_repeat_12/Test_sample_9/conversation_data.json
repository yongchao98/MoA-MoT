    "*   **Analysis of each option:**\n\n    1.  **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is, by definition, a planet with the same density as Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. This will be our reference point.\n\n    2.  **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated to be about 5.5 g/cm³, which is almost identical to Earth's density.\n\n    3.  **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** The key concept here is gravitational compression. When you have a more massive planet with the same basic building blocks (composition), its stronger gravity compresses the material more tightly. This effect is most pronounced in the planet's core. As a result, the overall average density of the planet increases. Therefore, this planet will be denser than Earth. Its density will be significantly greater than 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    4.  **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as in option c, a planet with less mass will have weaker gravity. This results in less gravitational compression compared to Earth. Therefore, its average density will be lower than Earth's density of 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n\n    *   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to higher mass and compression)\n    *   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower mass and less compression)\n\n    By comparing these, it is clear that planet (c) will have the highest density.\n\nLet's quickly verify the approximate density of planet (c) using the mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, which is roughly R ∝ M^0.27.\n\n*   If Mass (M) increases by a factor of 5, the Radius (R) increases by a factor of 5^0.27 ≈ 1.5.\n*   The Volume (V ∝ R³) increases by a factor of (1.5)³ ≈ 3.375.\n*   The Density (ρ = M/V) changes by a factor of 5 / 3.375 ≈ 1.48.\n*   So, the new density would be approximately 1.48 * 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ 8.15 g/cm³.\n\nThis calculation confirms that the planet in option (c) is substantially denser than the others.\n\n<<<D>>>"
