    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The question asks for the decay route and probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the |3,0,0> (3s) state to the |1,0,0> (1s) state via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state, and two photons are emitted sequentially. This process is a cascade decay.\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:** For a transition from a state |n,l,m> to |n',l',m'>, the selection rules are:\n    *   Δl = l' - l = ±1\n    *   Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1\n\n3.  **Determine the intermediate state:**\n    *   **First transition:** The atom starts in |3,0,0> (l=0, m=0).\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: Δl = l' - 0 = ±1. Since l must be non-negative, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: Δm = m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   So the intermediate state is of the form |n', 1, m'> where m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}.\n    *   **Second transition:** The atom must end up in the |1,0,0> state. The transition is from |n', 1, m'> to |1,0,0>.\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: Δm = 0 - m'. This must be 0, ±1. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate m' values (-1, 0, 1).\n    *   **The principal quantum number n' of the intermediate state:** The problem describes a two-photon decay. The rate of such a process is calculated using second-order perturbation theory, and the amplitude involves a sum over all possible intermediate states |n',l',m'>. The amplitude is proportional to 1/(E_initial - E_intermediate). To maximize the transition rate, the energy difference in the denominator should be minimized. The energy of a state is given by E_n = -R_H/n^2.\n        *   E_initial = E_3s = -R_H/9.\n        *   The possible intermediate states are |n'p> states (l=1).\n        *   For n'=2, E_intermediate = E_2p = -R_H/4. Denominator term: |E_3s - E_2p| = |-R_H/9 + R_H/4| = 5R_H/36.\n        *   For n'=4, E_intermediate = E_4p = -R_H/16. Denominator term: |E_3s - E_4p| = |-R_H/9 + R_H/16| = 7R_H/144.\n        The denominator is smallest for n'=2. Therefore, the cascade overwhelmingly proceeds through the |2,1,m'> intermediate states. The problem options all use |2,1,m'>, confirming this.\n\n4.  **Determine the possible decay routes:** Based on the above, there are three possible cascade routes, all passing through the n=2, l=1 (2p) shell:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability of each route:**\n    *   The probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, because the second step (2p -> 1s) is the only allowed decay channel for the 2p state, so its probability is 1.\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) of the first transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$ is given by:\n        $P(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1,0,1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\n        where Γ is the transition rate.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. For a spontaneous decay from a spherically symmetric state in the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transition rates to each of the magnetic sublevels m' = -1, 0, +1 of the p-state (l=1) must be equal.\n    *   This can be formally shown by calculating the matrix elements, which confirms that $|\\langle 2,1,0 | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,1 | (x+iy)/\\sqrt{2} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,-1 | (x-iy)/\\sqrt{2} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. In fact, the total rate to $|2,1,1\\rangle$, summing over polarizations, is proportional to $|\\langle 2,1,1|x|3,0,0\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,1|y|3,0,0\\rangle|^2$, which can be shown to be equal to $|\\langle 2,1,0|z|3,0,0\\rangle|^2$.\n    *   So, $\\Gamma(m'=-1) = \\Gamma(m'=0) = \\Gamma(m'=1)$.\n    *   The total transition rate is $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma(m'=-1) + \\Gamma(m'=0) + \\Gamma(m'=1) = 3\\Gamma(m'=0)$.\n    *   The probability for the decay to proceed through any specific sublevel m' is:\n        $P(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(m')}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma(m')}{3\\Gamma(m')} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   Each of the three possible routes has a probability of 1/3.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid physical statement is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
