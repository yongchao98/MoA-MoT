    "*   **1. Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n    The core principle to solve this problem is the conservation of energy. In this annihilation process, the total initial energy of the system (proton and antiproton) must be equal to the total final energy of the system (the four A particles).\n\n*   **2. Initial Energy Calculation**\n    The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest before the annihilation. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n    The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV. An antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times (938.27 \\text{ MeV}) = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **3. Final Energy Calculation**\n    The final state consists of four particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). All these 'A' particles have the same mass, given by $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the final particles must be moving. By symmetry, we can assume that the total energy is distributed equally among the four resulting particles. Therefore, they will all have the same speed, *v*.\n    The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n*   **4. Equating Energies and Solving for Velocity**\n    Now, we apply the conservation of energy, $E_i = E_f$:\n    $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    $1876.54 = 1200 \\gamma$\n    We can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n    Next, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to solve for the velocity *v*. Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}$\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1-\\beta^2} \\implies 1-\\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} \\implies \\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    Now, we plug in our value for $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n    This means the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light (c).\n\nLet's use a Python script for a more precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.27\n\n# Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300\n\n# Total initial energy (proton and antiproton at rest)\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# The total final energy is E_final = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# By conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n\n# Solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Now, solve for beta (v/c) using the relation: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - (1 / (gamma**2)))\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Principle**: The fundamental principle at play here is the conservation of energy. In this particle-antiparticle annihilation, the total energy before the event must equal the total energy after the event.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$)**:\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We assume both the proton and antiproton are essentially at rest.\n    *   Therefore, the initial energy is purely their combined rest mass energy.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton is the same as an antiproton. The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Final Energy ($E_{final}$)**:\n    *   The final system consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. They all have the same rest mass, given by $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Since the initial system was at rest (zero momentum), the final four particles must be moving to conserve momentum. By symmetry, the energy will be distributed equally among them, meaning they will all have the same speed, $v$.\n    *   The total energy of a single moving particle is given by the relativistic formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n        $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2) = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy and Solve for Velocity**:\n    *   Set $E_{initial} = E_{final}$:\n        $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   First, solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.563$\n    *   Now, use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1-\\beta^2} \\implies 1-\\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} \\implies \\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.443}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} = \\sqrt{0.591}$\n        $\\beta \\approx 0.769$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    The calculated value $\\beta \\approx 0.77$. Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = 0.77c$. This corresponds to option B.\n\nThe Python code confirmed this calculation precisely.\n\n<<<B>>>"
