    "An explanation of the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem is provided below.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** We have a two-electron system.\n    *   **Individual States:** Each electron is in a p-orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   **Coupled State:** The combined state of the system is given in the coupled basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Here, $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m=-1$ is the total magnetic quantum number (the z-component of the total angular momentum).\n    *   **Measurement:** We are performing a measurement on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, corresponding to the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Relate Measurement Outcome to Quantum States:**\n    *   The operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ have eigenvalues $m_1\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar$ respectively. The states corresponding to these measurements are the uncoupled basis states $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$.\n    *   For an electron in a p-orbital ($l=1$), the possible values for the magnetic quantum number $m$ are $\\{-1, 0, +1\\}$. So, $m_1, m_2 \\in \\{-1, 0, +1\\}$.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the state where $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the state where $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **The Role of Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n    *   The given state $|l, m\\rangle$ (coupled basis) can be written as a linear combination of the uncoupled basis states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$. The coefficients of this expansion are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, denoted as $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$.\n    *   $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$\n    *   The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle$, to be in the state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of this coefficient:\n        $P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l_1, l_2, l, m \\rangle|^2$\n\n4.  **Applying the Selection Rule (The Key Insight):**\n    *   The total angular momentum z-component operator is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   When we act with $L_z$ on a state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$, we get:\n        $L_z |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = (m_1\\hbar + m_2\\hbar) |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$\n    *   The coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar$.\n    *   This leads to a fundamental selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients: they are non-zero only if the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number. That is:\n        $m_1 + m_2 = m$\n    *   If $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$, the coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is zero.\n\n5.  **Solving the Specific Problem:**\n    *   The system is in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. So, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the selection rule: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We compare this sum to the system's total magnetic quantum number: $-2 \\neq -1$.\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this specific combination must be zero:\n        $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n    *   The probability is the square of this coefficient:\n        $P(-1, -1) = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n6.  **Code Verification (Optional but Recommended):**\n    We can use a computational library like `sympy` in Python to calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and verify our reasoning.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\nfrom sympy import S\n\n# Define the quantum numbers from the problem.\n# j1 corresponds to l1, j2 to l2, j to l.\nj1 = S(1)\nm1 = S(-1)\nj2 = S(1)\nm2 = S(-1)\nj = S(2)\nm = S(-1)\n\n# Calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <j1,m1; j2,m2 | j,m>\ncg_coefficient = CG(j1, m1, j2, m2, j, m).doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the magnitude of the coefficient.\nprobability = abs(cg_coefficient)**2\n\n# Print the final probability value\nprint(probability)\n```\nExecuting this code would yield `0`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe state of the system has a total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to $m=-1$. A measurement of the individual z-components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ must yield results ($m_1\\hbar, m_2\\hbar$) such that their sum is equal to the total, i.e., $m_1+m_2 = m$. The question asks for the probability of a measurement where $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$. The sum is $m_1+m_2 = -2$. Since this sum $(-2)$ is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the system $(-1)$, such a measurement outcome is impossible. Therefore, the probability is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem asks for the probability of a specific outcome when measuring the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum for a two-electron system in a given coupled state.\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The initial state of the system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle$. Here, $l_1=1$ (electron 1 is in a p-orbital), $l_2=1$ (electron 2 is in a p-orbital), the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the total magnetic quantum number is $m=-1$. So, the state is $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The measurement is of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The states corresponding to definite values of these observables are the uncoupled basis states, written as $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$ or simply $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ in this context.\n    *   We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the system in the state where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. So, the final state is $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Relate the Bases using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n    The probability of finding the system, initially in the state $|l, m\\rangle$, in a specific uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state. This projection is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the Selection Rule for Angular Momentum:**\n    A fundamental property of angular momentum addition is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component of angular momentum ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$) is the sum of the individual z-components. The eigenvalues must also add up. This means that a coupled state $|l,m\\rangle$ can only be composed of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ for which the magnetic quantum numbers satisfy the following selection rule:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n    If $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is zero, and the probability of that measurement outcome is also zero.\n\n4.  **Check the Condition for the Given Problem:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We compare the sum to the total magnetic quantum number: $-2 \\neq -1$.\n\nSince $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$, the condition is not met. It is physically impossible to start in a state with a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$ and measure the individual components to sum to $-2\\hbar$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of this event is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>"
