    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **System:** A spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment vector **μ** related to its spin vector **S** by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   **Initial Condition:** The particle is in a magnetic field **B_i** = B **ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction). The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate.\n*   **Initial Hamiltonian:** The energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by the Hamiltonian H = -**μ** · **B**.\n    So, the initial Hamiltonian is H_i = - (γ**S**) · (B **ẑ**) = -γB S_z.\n*   **Eigenstates and Energies:** The operator S_z has two eigenstates for a spin-1/2 particle: spin-up |+>_z and spin-down |->_z.\n    *   S_z |+>_z = +(ħ/2) |+>_z, giving energy E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)\n    *   S_z |->_z = -(ħ/2) |->_z, giving energy E_- = +γB(ħ/2)\n*   **Initial State Vector:** \"Aligned with the field\" means the magnetic moment points in the same direction as the field (+Z), which corresponds to the spin-up state |+>_z. This is also the state of minimum energy (assuming γ > 0).\n    So, at t=0, the state of the particle is |ψ(0)> = |+>_z. In the standard S_z basis, this is represented by the column vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Time Evolution (t > 0)\n\n*   **New Condition:** At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B_f** = B **ŷ** (pointing in the +Y direction).\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** The Hamiltonian governing the system for t > 0 is H = -**μ** · **B_f** = -γB S_y.\n*   **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle at any time t > 0 is given by the Schrödinger equation's solution:\n    |ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>\n    Substituting H = -γB S_y, we get:\n    |ψ(t)> = e^(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+>_z = e^(iγBS_yt/ħ) |+>_z\n\n### 3. Calculating the State Vector at Time t\n\nTo compute the evolution, we use the matrix representations in the S_z basis:\n*   The spin-y operator is S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli Y-matrix: σ_y = `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   The time evolution operator becomes: U(t) = e^(iγB(ħ/2)σ_y t/ħ) = e^(i(γBt/2)σ_y).\n*   We use the property of Pauli matrices: e^(iθσ_n) = I cos(θ) + iσ_n sin(θ), where I is the identity matrix.\n    Here, the angle θ = γBt/2 and the operator is σ_y.\n    U(t) = I cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y sin(γBt/2)\n    U(t) = `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` cos(γBt/2) + i `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]` sin(γBt/2)\n    U(t) = `[[cos(γBt/2), 0], [0, cos(γBt/2)]]` + `[[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]`\n    U(t) = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n*   Now, we find the state vector |ψ(t)>:\n    |ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]` `[[1], [0]]`\n    |ψ(t)> = `[[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n\nThis means |ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2) |+>_z - sin(γBt/2) |->_z.\n\n### 4. Finding the Expectation Value of μ_z\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency of the *average* of the z-component of the particle's moment. The average is the quantum mechanical expectation value, `<μ_z(t)>`.\n*   <μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ <S_z(t)>\n*   We calculate <S_z(t)>:\n    <S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>\n    The S_z operator is S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)`[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    <S_z(t)> = `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * (ħ/2)`[[1, 0], [0, -1]]` * `[[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    <S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * `[[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    <S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]\n*   Using the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    <S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)\n*   Therefore, the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is:\n    <μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)\n\n### 5. Identifying the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expression for <μ_z(t)> is of the form A*cos(ωt), where A is the amplitude and ω is the angular frequency of oscillation.\nFrom <μ_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt), we can see that the angular frequency is:\nω = γB\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin's expectation value precesses around the new magnetic field direction (**ŷ**) at the Larmor frequency, ω_L = γB. The projection of this precessing vector onto the z-axis oscillates with this frequency.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>"
