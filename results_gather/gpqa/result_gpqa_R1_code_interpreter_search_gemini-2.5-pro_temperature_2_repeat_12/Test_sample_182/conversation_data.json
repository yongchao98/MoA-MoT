    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.**\n    The reactant is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\". Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n    *   **\"cyclohex-3-ene\"**: This is the parent ring, a six-membered ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n    *   **\"carboxylic acid\"**: This is the principal functional group (-COOH), so it is located at position C1.\n    *   **\"2-formyl\"**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position C2.\n    *   **\"5-vinyl\"**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is at position C5.\n\n    Let's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):**\n        *   6 carbons in the cyclohexene ring.\n        *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n        *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10. So, C10.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):**\n        *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group.\n        *   1 oxygen in the formyl group.\n        *   Total Oxygens = 2 + 1 = 3. So, O3.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):**\n        *   Let's count the hydrogens on the ring carbons by ensuring each carbon has 4 bonds:\n            *   C1 (bonded to COOH, C2, C6): 1 H.\n            *   C2 (bonded to CHO, C1, C3): 1 H.\n            *   C3 (double bonded to C4, single bonded to C2): 1 H.\n            *   C4 (double bonded to C3, single bonded to C5): 1 H.\n            *   C5 (bonded to vinyl group, C4, C6): 1 H.\n            *   C6 (bonded to C1, C5): 2 H's.\n            *   Ring Hydrogens = 1+1+1+1+1+2 = 7.\n        *   Now, let's count the hydrogens in the substituent groups:\n            *   -COOH: 1 H.\n            *   -CHO: 1 H.\n            *   -CH=CH2: 3 H's.\n            *   Substituent Hydrogens = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5.\n        *   Total Hydrogens = 7 (ring) + 5 (substituents) = 12. So, H12.\n\n    The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the reaction and determine the product's structure.**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid). This is a very powerful reducing agent combination, known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) at C2 will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring (C3=C4) will be reduced to a single bond (C3-C4), saturating the ring.\n    *   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at C5 will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    Therefore, the final product is a saturated cyclohexane ring with a methyl group at C1, another methyl group at C2, and an ethyl group at C5 (numbering relative to the reactant). The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the product.**\n    The product is a substituted cyclohexane. Let's find its formula:\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms remains the same: 10. So, C10.\n    *   The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n    *   Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or pi (Ï€) bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n    IHD = C - (H/2) + 1  (for hydrocarbons)\n\n    For the product with the formula C10H20:\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   IHD = 1\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the IHD from the product's structure. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains one ring and no double or triple (pi) bonds.\n    *   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n    *   IHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
