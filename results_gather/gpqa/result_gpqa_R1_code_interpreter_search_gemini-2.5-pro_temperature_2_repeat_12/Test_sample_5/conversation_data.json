    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The goal is to find the energy spectrum (the set of possible energy eigenvalues) for a particle of mass 'm' moving in a two-dimensional potential V(r, θ).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Potential:** The given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr²cos²(θ)\n\n3.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:** The Schrödinger equation is often easier to solve if the potential can be separated into functions of independent coordinates. Let's try converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the standard transformations:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r² = x² + y²\n\n    From these, we can identify two parts of the potential:\n    *   The term `(1/2)kr²` becomes `(1/2)k(x² + y²)`.\n    *   The term `(3/2)kr²cos²(θ)` can be rewritten as `(3/2)k(r cos(θ))²`. Since `x = r cos(θ)`, this term becomes `(3/2)kx²`.\n\n4.  **Combine the terms in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    V(x, y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)kx²\n    V(x, y) = (1/2)kx² + (1/2)ky² + (3/2)kx²\n    Combine the coefficients of the x² terms:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx² + (1/2)ky²\n    V(x, y) = (4/2)kx² + (1/2)ky²\n    V(x, y) = 2kx² + (1/2)ky²\n\n5.  **Recognize the Form of the Potential:** The potential V(x, y) is now expressed as a sum of two independent terms, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\n    V(x, y) = Vₓ(x) + Vᵧ(y)\n    where:\n    *   Vₓ(x) = 2kx²\n    *   Vᵧ(y) = (1/2)ky²\n\n    This is the potential of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n6.  **Set up the Schrödinger Equation:** The time-independent Schrödinger equation is Hψ = Eψ, where H is the Hamiltonian operator.\n    H = T + V = (-ħ²/2m)(∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y²) + V(x, y)\n    H = [(-ħ²/2m)(∂²/∂x²) + Vₓ(x)] + [(-ħ²/2m)(∂²/∂y²) + Vᵧ(y)]\n    H = Hₓ + Hᵧ\n\n    Since the Hamiltonian is separable, the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the x and y dimensions:\n    E = Eₓ + Eᵧ\n\n7.  **Solve for the Energy in Each Dimension:** We need to find the energy eigenvalues for each one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The standard energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator with potential V(q) = (1/2)k_eff q² is:\n    Eₙ = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency ω = sqrt(k_eff / m).\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        Vₓ(x) = 2kx². We can write this in the standard form (1/2)k_eff q² as Vₓ(x) = (1/2)(4k)x².\n        So, the effective spring constant is kₓ = 4k.\n        The angular frequency is ωₓ = sqrt(kₓ / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m).\n        The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n        E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħωₓ = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        Vᵧ(y) = (1/2)ky².\n        The effective spring constant is kᵧ = k.\n        The angular frequency is ωᵧ = sqrt(kᵧ / m) = sqrt(k/m).\n        The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n        E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħωᵧ = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Total Energy:** The total energy spectrum is the sum of the energies from both dimensions, where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = [(n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)] + [(n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)]\n    Factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
