    "An isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is described by the potential $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. In spherical coordinates, this becomes $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$, where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.\n\nThis system can be solved by separating the Schrödinger equation in Cartesian coordinates. The total energy is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n$E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n_i$ is a non-negative integer quantum number.\n\nFor the three-dimensional isotropic case, the total energy eigenvalue is:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n$E_n = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nLet $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. Then the energy levels are given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n1.  **Identify the energy levels:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible value of $n$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z$ must be non-negative integers, the minimum value for $n$ is $0$ (when $n_x = n_y = n_z = 0$).\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the degeneracy of the Third Excited State ($n=3$):**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n$. We need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\n    The possible combinations for $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ are:\n    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). This gives 3 states.\n    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). This gives 6 states.\n    *   Permutations of (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1). This gives 1 state.\n\n    The total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for the third excited state is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th energy level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3 - Incorrect degeneracy.\nB) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10 - Incorrect energy expression (this is for a particle in a spherical box).\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3 - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\nD) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 10 - Correct energy and degeneracy.\n\n<<<D>>>"
