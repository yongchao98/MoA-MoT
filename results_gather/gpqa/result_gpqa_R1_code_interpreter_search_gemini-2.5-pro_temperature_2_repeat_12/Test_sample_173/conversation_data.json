    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, let's call their rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The total energy before (rest energy of M) equals the total energy after (sum of rest energies and kinetic energies of m1 and m2).\n    *   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial momentum is zero, so the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the rest-mass energies (`m*c^2`):\n1.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n2.  `(m1 + m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`\n\nFrom the initial condition, `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. So, the sum of the final rest-mass energies is:\n`m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nNow substitute equation (1) into this result:\n` (2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n` 3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n` m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nThe rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment is 99 GeV. The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`) is:\n`m1*c^2 = 2 * (99 GeV) = 198 GeV`\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is called the Q-value.\n`Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T1 + T2`\n`Q = (Initial Rest Energy) - (Final Rest Energy)`\n`Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`. From momentum conservation, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nDividing these two equations gives the ratio of kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (m2*c^2) / (m1*c^2) = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`\nThis means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between kinetic energy `T`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is given by `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\nSince `p1 = p2`, we must have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe also know that `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Let's substitute this and the mass-energy values into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is `T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical value.\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert this difference to MeV (Mega-electron Volts). Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n```python\n# Constants and initial values from the problem statement\nM_c2 = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\nfinal_mass_fraction = 0.99\nm1_to_m2_ratio = 2.0\n\n# 1. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments (m1 and m2)\n# The sum of the final rest-mass energies\nm_sum_c2 = final_mass_fraction * M_c2\n\n# We have two equations:\n# eq1: m1_c2 + m2_c2 = m_sum_c2\n# eq2: m1_c2 = m1_to_m2_ratio * m2_c2\n# Substitute eq2 into eq1:\n# (m1_to_m2_ratio * m2_c2) + m2_c2 = m_sum_c2\n# m2_c2 * (m1_to_m2_ratio + 1) = m_sum_c2\nm2_c2 = m_sum_c2 / (m1_to_m2_ratio + 1)\nm1_c2 = m1_to_m2_ratio * m2_c2\n\n# 2. Calculate the total kinetic energy (Q-value)\nQ_value = M_c2 - m_sum_c2\n\n# 3. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n# In the classical limit, T1/T2 = m2/m1. Since T1 + T2 = Q_value,\n# T1 = Q_value * (m2 / (m1 + m2)) = Q_value * (m2_c2 / m_sum_c2)\nT1_classical = Q_value * (m2_c2 / m_sum_c2)\n\n# 4. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n# From momentum conservation, p1=p2, which means (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2.\n# Using (p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2), we get:\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1_c2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2_c2)\n# Since T2 = Q_value - T1, we can solve for T1. The solution is:\n# T1 = (Q_value^2 + 2*Q_value*m2_c2) / (2*Q_value + 2*(m1_c2+m2_c2))\nnumerator = Q_value**2 + 2 * Q_value * m2_c2\ndenominator = 2 * Q_value + 2 * (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\nT1_relativistic = numerator / denominator\n\n# 5.

    "An atomic nucleus of mass M has a rest-mass energy `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`. It fissions into two fragments, with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`, where `m1 = 2*m2`.\nThe total rest-mass energy of the fragments is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy:\n`m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nWe can now solve for the individual rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n`m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 3*m2*c^2`\n`3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\nAnd `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2 = 198 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n`T_total = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p1 = p2`).\n\n**Classical Calculation for T1:**\nIn non-relativistic mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`. Since `p1 = p2`, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses:\n`T1 / T2 = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`, so `T2 = 2*T1`.\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T1 + T2 = T1 + 2*T1 = 3*T1 = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**Relativistic Calculation for T1:**\nIn relativistic mechanics, the energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The total energy E is `E = T + m*c^2`.\nTherefore, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\nSince `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\nSubstitute `T2 = 3 - T1` and the rest-mass energy values:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Difference:**\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\nTo express this in MeV, we multiply by 1000 (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>"
