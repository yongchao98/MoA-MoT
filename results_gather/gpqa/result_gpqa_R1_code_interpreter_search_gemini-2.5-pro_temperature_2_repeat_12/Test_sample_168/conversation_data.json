    "This question asks us to compare the total energy spectrum of particle E in two different nuclear decays. Let's break down the problem by analyzing the spectrum's shape (continuous vs. discrete) and its endpoint.\n\n### 1. Shape of the Energy Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete)\n\n*   **Original Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n    The initial state has two heavy nucleons `2A`. After the decay, the final state consists of multiple particles: the `2B` nucleons, two `E` particles, and two `V` particles. For simplicity, we can think of this as the initial energy and momentum being distributed among three groups of products: the `(2B)` system, the `(2E)` system, and the `(2V)` system.\n\n    When a decay results in three or more final particles (a \"multi-body final state\"), the available energy is shared among them in a continuous fashion, constrained only by the conservation of energy and momentum. No single particle (or group of particles like `2E`) will have a fixed energy. Instead, they will exhibit a continuous spectrum of possible energies. The problem statement confirms this by stating the original spectrum is continuous.\n\n*   **Variant Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`\n    In this case, the two `V` particles are replaced by a single `M` particle. The final state now consists of the `2B` nucleons, the two `E` particles, and the particle `M`. Again, this is a multi-body final state. The available decay energy will be shared continuously between the `(2B)` system, the `(2E)` system, and the `M` particle.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Shape:** Since the final state in the variant decay still contains more than two \"bodies\" sharing the energy, the total energy spectrum of the `E` particles will remain **continuous**. The shape might be different because the phase space distribution changes (replacing two particles with one), but it will not become a discrete line. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n### 2. Endpoint of the Energy Spectrum\n\nThe endpoint of the energy spectrum (let's call it `Q_endpoint`) represents the maximum possible kinetic energy that the `E` particles can carry away. This maximum energy corresponds to the total energy released by the decay, which is often called the Q-value. This Q-value is the difference between the total rest mass energy of the initial particles and the total rest mass energy of the final particles.\n\n`Q-value = (Mass_initial - Mass_final) * c²`\n\nThis released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of all the final particles. The endpoint for the `E` particles occurs when the other particles (`2B` and `2V` or `M`) carry away the minimum possible kinetic energy.\n\n*   **Endpoint of the Original Decay (Q_orig):**\n    `Mass_initial = m(2A)`\n    `Mass_final_orig = m(2B) + m(2E) + m(2V)`\n    `Q_orig = [m(2A) - (m(2B) + m(2E) + m(2V))] * c²`\n\n*   **Endpoint of the Variant Decay (Q_variant):**\n    `Mass_initial = m(2A)`\n    `Mass_final_variant = m(2B) + m(2E) + m(M)`\n    `Q_variant = [m(2A) - (m(2B) + m(2E) + m(M))] * c²`\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    Let's compare the two endpoints by subtracting `Q_orig` from `Q_variant`:\n    `Q_variant - Q_orig = [m(2A) - m(2B) - m(2E) - m(M)]c² - [m(2A) - m(2B) - m(2E) - m(2V)]c²`\n    `Q_variant - Q_orig = [m(2V) - m(M)]c²`\n\n    The problem states that `M` is a **massless** particle, so `m(M) = 0`.\n    The particle `V` is described as a \"lighter particle\", a standard term for particles like neutrinos which, we now know, have a small but non-zero mass. Thus, `m(V) > 0`. Consequently, the mass of two `V` particles, `m(2V)`, is also greater than zero.\n\n    Therefore:\n    `Q_variant - Q_orig = (m(2V) - 0) * c² = m(2V)c² > 0`\n    This means `Q_variant > Q_orig`.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Endpoint:** The total energy released in the variant decay is greater than in the original decay because less energy is \"used up\" creating the rest mass of the final particles (since M is massless). This means the endpoint of the energy spectrum **increases**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining our findings:\n1.  The spectrum remains **continuous**.\n2.  The endpoint **increases**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
