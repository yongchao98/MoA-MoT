    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a substituted cyclohexanone, which can act as a nucleophile after deprotonation.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which is a classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Michael Addition. The base will form an enolate from the ketone, which will then attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) from the ketone.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   **C-2:** This carbon is bonded to the carbonyl group, an ethyl group, and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   **C-6:** This carbon is bonded to the carbonyl group, a methyl group, a hydrogen atom, and C-5 of the ring. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since there is only one possible position to deprotonate (C-6), the t-BuOK base will selectively remove the proton from C-6 to form a single regiochemical enolate. The double bond of the enolate will be between C-1 and C-6.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The enolate anion is nucleophilic at C-6. This nucleophile attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The intermediate formed is an ester enolate, which is then protonated during the work-up (likely by tert-butanol, formed from the reaction of t-BuOK with the ketone) to yield the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   A new substituent, a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` (ethyl propanoate) group, is added to the C-6 position.\n    *   The final structure has a cyclohexanone ring with the C=O at C-1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C-2, and a methyl group plus the new `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group at C-6.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate. This is a valid IUPAC naming convention where the more complex ring is treated as a substituent on the principal chain (the propanoate chain).\n    *   The chain is `ethyl 3-(...-cyclohexyl)propanoate`, meaning the cyclohexyl ring is attached to carbon-3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's number the cyclohexyl ring substituent according to IUPAC rules, aiming for the lowest locants for principal groups and substituents. If the ring is a substituent, the point of attachment is C-1'.\n    *   In our product, the propanoate chain is attached at the original C-6 position. Let's call this C-1' of the substituent ring. The original C-1 (with C=O) is adjacent, so it becomes C-2'. The original C-2 (with ethyl and methyl) is C-3'.\n    *   Let's list the substituents on the ring using this new numbering:\n        *   Point of attachment: C-1'. There is also a methyl group on this carbon. So, `1-methyl`.\n        *   Carbonyl group: At C-2'. So, `2-oxo`.\n        *   Ethyl and methyl groups: At C-3'. So, `3-ethyl, 3-methyl`.\n    *   Combining these gives the name of the ring substituent: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name given in options A and C.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has acidic α-protons on the carbon attached to the nitro group.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (trans-crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, another classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is another Michael Addition. The base deprotonates the nitroalkane to form a nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Nitronate Anion Formation:**\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon (C-1) of 1-nitropropane to form the resonance-stabilized nitronate anion (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻–NO₂`). This anion is nucleophilic at the carbon atom.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   In but-2-enenitrile (CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN), the β-carbon is the CH group adjacent to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C-1 of the nitropropane and C-3 of the butanenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water (H₂O) during work-up.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The 1-nitropropane fragment is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)`.\n    *   The but-2-enenitrile fragment becomes `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   Combining these fragments at the point of reaction gives the final structure: **CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN**.\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent name ends in `-nitrile`.\n    *   We identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C-1.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group on C-3 (`3-methyl`) and a nitro group on C-4 (`4-nitro`).\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given in options C and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) Product B is incorrect.\n*   B) Both products A and B are incorrect.\n*   C) Both products A and B match our derived structures.\n*   D) Product A is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
