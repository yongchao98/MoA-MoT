    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone, which is a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   The substituents on the benzene ring are:\n    *   -COCH3 (acetyl group) at position 1.\n    *   -Br (bromo group) at position 3.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro group) at position 5.\n*   This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent affects further electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho-, para*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho-, para*-director. (This group appears in intermediate steps).\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director. (Forms when -NH2 is in strong acid).\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Synthesis Strategies**\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Direct Substitution**\n    If we sequentially add the three groups, the directors on the ring must guide the incoming groups to the correct positions. Since all groups are meta to each other, a good strategy would be to have meta-directing groups on the ring.\n    1.  **Benzene --(Acylation)--> Acetophenone** (-COCH3 is a *meta*-director).\n    2.  **Acetophenone --(Nitration)--> 3-Nitroacetophenone** (The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the meta position).\n    3.  **3-Nitroacetophenone --(Bromination)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. In this step, both the -COCH3 group (at C1) and the -NO2 group (at C3) are *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to C5. This is a very straightforward and chemically sound synthesis. However, this simple 3-step synthesis is not among the 7-step options provided. This suggests a more complex route is intended.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Use of a Removable Directing Group**\n    The long sequences involving `Fe/HCl` (reduction of nitro to amino), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), and `H3PO2` (deamination) are a strong indicator that an amino group (-NH2) is used as a temporary directing group and is later removed. This is a common strategy for achieving substitution patterns that are not accessible by direct substitution.\n\n**4. Analyze the Provided Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    ii) Bromobenzene is an o,p-director, so nitration yields o- and p-bromonitrobenzene.\n    iii) The next step is Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on p-bromonitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2 ...**\n    i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n    iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene (Deamination with H3PO2).\n    The first four steps convert benzene back into benzene, which makes no sense. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ...**\n    i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    iii) The reaction of aniline with CH3COCl/AlCl3 is problematic for Friedel-Crafts acylation. If we assume it protects the amine to form acetanilide (-NHCOCH3), then:\n    iv) Bromination of acetanilide gives p-bromoacetanilide.\n    v) Nitration of p-bromoacetanilide gives 4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide.\n    vi & vii) Hydrolysis (a missing step), followed by diazotization and deamination of 4-bromo-2-nitroaniline would yield 3-bromonitrobenzene.\n    This sequence does not produce the target molecule. Thus, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence uses the removable directing group strategy. Let's trace the steps:\n    i) **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.**\n    ii) **Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n    iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone.** Here, the -Br is an o,p-director and directs nitration primarily to its ortho (C4, C6) and para positions. C4 is a likely position. The product is NOT the final target. This nitro group will serve as a precursor to our temporary directing group.\n    iv) **3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone --(Fe/HCl)--> 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    v) **3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Bromo-4-amino-5-nitroacetophenone.** This is the crucial step. We need to install the final nitro group. In the strong acid medium, the amino group is protonated to anilinium (-NH3+), a meta-director. Let's analyze the directing effects for nitration:\n        *   -COCH3 at C1 (meta-director) directs to C5.\n        *   -Br at C3 (o,p-director) directs to C2 and C6.\n        *   -NH3+ at C4 (meta-director) directs to C2 and C6.\n        While there is conflicting direction, substitution at C5 is plausible. Given that this is the only logical pathway among the options, we assume this step proceeds to give the required product for a \"high-yield\" synthesis context.\n    vi) **3-Bromo-4-amino-5-nitroacetophenone --(NaNO2/HCl)--> ...diazonium salt.** The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    vii) **...diazonium salt --(H3PO2)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\n    This sequence logically constructs the target molecule by installing and then removing a directing group. Although the regioselectivity of step (v) is complex, this option presents the only coherent synthetic plan among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
