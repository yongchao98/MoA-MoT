    "*   **Analyze the Question:** The question asks which symmetries are fundamental requirements for *all* operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT).\n\n*   **1. Lorentz Symmetry & 2. Poincare Symmetry:**\n    *   SMEFT is constructed as a local, relativistic quantum field theory. A fundamental requirement of any such theory is that its laws are independent of the inertial frame of reference. This invariance is described by Poincare symmetry.\n    *   The Poincare group consists of spacetime translations, rotations, and boosts. The rotations and boosts together form the Lorentz group. Therefore, respecting Poincare symmetry implies respecting Lorentz symmetry.\n    *   SMEFT operators are constructed by combining Standard Model fields and their derivatives in a way that forms Lorentz scalars (i.e., they are invariant under Lorentz transformations). This ensures the action is Lorentz invariant, which in turn leads to invariance under the full Poincare group.\n    *   Therefore, both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected.\n\n*   **3. CP Symmetry (Charge-Parity):**\n    *   The Standard Model (SM) itself violates CP symmetry, most famously observed in the weak interactions involving quarks (described by the CKM matrix).\n    *   SMEFT is an extension of the SM that includes higher-dimensional operators. These new operators can provide additional sources of CP violation beyond the SM. In fact, searching for new sources of CP violation is a major goal of precision measurements that are interpreted in the SMEFT framework.\n    *   Since the SM part of SMEFT already violates CP, and the higher-dimensional operators are allowed to violate it as well, CP is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n*   **4. CPT Symmetry (Charge-Parity-Time):**\n    *   The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined CPT transformation.\n    *   SMEFT is constructed to be precisely such a theory (local, Lorentz-invariant). Therefore, it must respect CPT symmetry. Any violation of CPT would imply a breakdown of the fundamental principles of local quantum field theory, such as Lorentz invariance.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n    *   Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected.\n    *   CP symmetry (3) is NOT necessarily respected.\n    *   CPT symmetry (4) must be respected due to the CPT theorem.\n\n    The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
