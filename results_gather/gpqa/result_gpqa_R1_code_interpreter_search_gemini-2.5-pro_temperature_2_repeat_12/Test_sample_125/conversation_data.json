    "**Detailed Analysis and Reasoning**\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5. The configuration is specified as (S).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂(C=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a powerful reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH is achiral and can attack the carbonyl group from either face (*re* face or *si* face).\n*   **Products:** This attack creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting molecule already has a chiral center at C5, the two possible products will be diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct compounds (diastereomers) are formed. Let's call them **D1** and **D2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a symmetrical beta-diketone (CH₃-(C=O)-CH₂-(C=O)-CH₃) and is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** \"Excess\" NaBH₄ indicates that both ketone groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced to secondary alcohols, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and reagents are all achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The product is pentane-2,4-diol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃).\n    *   Let's analyze the stereoisomers. With two chiral centers, there are a maximum of 2² = 4 stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   The molecule is symmetrical around C3.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers of each other. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, resulting in a racemic mixture. Let's call these **E1** and **E2**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C3-CH₂ group. Therefore, it is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same meso compound. Let's call this **M**.\n    *   The meso compound (M) is a diastereomer of the enantiomers (E1 and E2).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the products and analyze with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Total Mixture:** The final mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    *   **D1** and **D2** (diastereomers from Reaction I)\n    *   **E1**, **E2** (enantiomers from Reaction II), and **M** (meso compound from Reaction II)\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC Separation Principle:** This technique uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like D1 and D2) have different physical properties and thus **are separated**.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like E1 and E2) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **are not separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The **meso compound (M)** is a diastereomer of E1 and E2, so it has different physical properties and **will be separated** from the E1/E2 peak.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (pentane-2,4-diols) – they have different molecular weights, chain lengths, and functional groups. Therefore, the set of compounds from Reaction I will be separated from the set of compounds from Reaction II.\n*   **Counting the Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n    1.  **Peak 1:** D1\n    2.  **Peak 2:** D2\n    3.  **Peak 3:** E1 and E2 (co-eluting enantiomeric pair)\n    4.  **Peak 4:** M (meso compound)\n*   **Total:** **4 peaks** will be observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC Separation Principle:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It also separates diastereomers.\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:** The chiral column can distinguish between all five unique stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n*   **Counting the Peaks in Chiral HPLC:**\n    1.  **Peak 1:** D1 ((3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol)\n    2.  **Peak 2:** D2 ((3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol)\n    3.  **Peak 3:** E1 ((2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n    4.  **Peak 4:** E2 ((2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n    5.  **Peak 5:** M (meso-pentane-2,4-diol)\n*   **Total:** **5 peaks** will be observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nC) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
