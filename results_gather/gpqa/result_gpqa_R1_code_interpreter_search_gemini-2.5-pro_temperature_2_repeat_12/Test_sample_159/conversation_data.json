    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Aperture's Geometry**\n    *   The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side.\n    *   The question states that N becomes infinitely large (N -> ∞).\n    *   When the number of sides of a regular polygon with a constant apothem approaches infinity, the polygon itself approaches a circle. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle.\n    *   Therefore, the problem simplifies to calculating the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Diffraction by a Circular Aperture**\n    *   The diffraction pattern produced by a monochromatic plane wave passing through a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n    *   The angular positions of the intensity minima (the dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J_1(x)`.\n\n3.  **Formula for Minima Positions**\n    *   The condition for an intensity minimum in the Fraunhofer (far-field) diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by:\n        `sin(θ) = z_m * λ / (π * D)`\n        where:\n        *   `θ` is the angular position of the minimum.\n        *   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n        *   `D` is the diameter of the aperture.\n        *   `z_m` is the m-th zero of the Bessel function `J_1(x)`.\n\n4.  **Adapting the Formula to the Problem**\n    *   In our case, the radius of the circular aperture is 'a'. Therefore, the diameter `D = 2a`.\n    *   Substituting `D = 2a` into the formula:\n        `sin(θ_m) = z_m * λ / (π * 2a)`\n    *   The problem states we can use the small angle approximation, where `sin(θ) ≈ θ` (for θ in radians).\n    *   So, the angular position of the m-th minimum is:\n        `θ_m = (z_m / (2 * π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n5.  **Calculating the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima**\n    *   We need the first two positive zeros of the `J_1(x)` function. These are well-known values:\n        *   First zero, `z_1 ≈ 3.8317`\n        *   Second zero, `z_2 ≈ 7.0156`\n    *   **Angular position of the first minimum (`θ_1`):**\n        `θ_1 = (z_1 / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`\n        (Note: The famous `1.22` factor comes from `z_1 / π ≈ 1.22`, used in the formula `sin(θ) = 1.22 λ / D`).\n    *   **Angular position of the second minimum (`θ_2`):**\n        `θ_2 = (z_2 / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.116 * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Finding the Angular Distance**\n    *   The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`.\n    *   `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 = ( (z_2 / (2 * π)) - (z_1 / (2 * π)) ) * (λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ = (z_2 - z_1) / (2 * π) * (λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * π) * (λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ = 3.1839 / (2 * π) * (λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Comparing with Options**\n    *   The calculated coefficient is approximately 0.507.\n    *   The given options are:\n        A) 1.220 λ /a\n        B) 0.500 λ / a\n        C) 0.506 λ / a\n        D) 0.610 λ / a\n    *   The calculated value `0.5068` is best matched by option C, `0.506`.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a python script to compute the value more precisely.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.special as sp\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Find the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order 1 (J1)\n# The function sp.jn_zeros(order, number_of_zeros) returns the first 'number_of_zeros'\n# positive zeros of the Bessel function of the given 'order'.\nz1, z2 = sp.jn_zeros(1, 2)\n\n# The angular position of the m-th minimum under the small angle approximation is:\n# theta_m = (z_m / (2 * np.pi)) * (lambda / a)\n# where 'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n\n# The angular distance between the first two minima is delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1.\n# delta_theta = ( (z2 / (2 * np.pi)) - (z1 / (2 * np.pi)) ) * (lambda / a)\n# delta_theta = ( (z2 - z1) / (2 * np.pi) ) * (lambda / a)\n\n# Let's calculate the coefficient for (lambda / a).\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"The coefficient for the angular distance is: {coefficient}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` will approach a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides `N` approaches infinity. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The angular positions of the intensity minima (dark rings) are given by the formula:\n\n`sin(θ_m) = z_m * λ / (π * D)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `D` is the diameter of the aperture. In our case, the radius is `a`, so `D = 2a`.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th positive zero of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J_1(x)`.\n\nSubstituting `D = 2a` into the formula:\n`sin(θ_m) = z_m * λ / (π * 2a)`\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. Thus, the angular position of the m-th minimum is:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the positions of the first (`m=1`) and second (`m=2`) minima. This requires the first two zeros of `J_1(x)`:\n*   First zero, `z_1 ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z_2 ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum is:\n`θ_1 = (z_1 / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum is:\n`θ_2 = (z_2 / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n\nThe angular distance between them is `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`:\n`Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 = (z_2 / (2π)) * (λ/a) - (z_1 / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n`Δθ = ((z_2 - z_1) / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n\nWe can now substitute the values of the zeros. The python code execution precisely calculates the coefficient `(z_2 - z_1) / (2π)`:\n\nThe output from the code is `0.5067303515575121`.\n\nSo, the angular distance is:\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ/a)`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1.220 λ/a\nB) 0.500 λ/a\nC) 0.506 λ/a\nD) 0.610 λ/a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067` is best matched by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
