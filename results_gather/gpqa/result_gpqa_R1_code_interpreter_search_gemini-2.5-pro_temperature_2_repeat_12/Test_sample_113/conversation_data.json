    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   The reaction is: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.\n    *   This is a classic example of cyanohydrin formation. Butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN provides the nucleophile, the cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    *   The mechanism involves two steps:\n        1.  Nucleophilic attack: The cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n            CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃ + CN⁻  →  CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃\n        2.  Protonation: The alkoxide ion is then protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin.\n            CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    *   Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺). The general representation for a proton source in an aqueous solution is the hydronium ion, H₃O⁺. While the reaction must be carefully controlled to avoid excessive protonation of the cyanide nucleophile (which would form HCN and reduce the nucleophile concentration), an acidic source is required for the final protonation step.\n    *   Looking at the options for A, NaHSO₃ is incorrect. It forms bisulfite addition products. H₃O⁺ is the correct choice. This narrows our options down to B and C.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   The reaction is: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n    *   This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction, as indicated by the presence of water (H₂O).\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base. The reaction proceeds via an amide intermediate.\n    *   Since the product is a carboxylic acid (and not a carboxylate salt), acid catalysis is directly implied by the options.\n    *   Reagent B must be the catalyst for this hydrolysis. Let's evaluate the remaining options for B (from choices B and C):\n        *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid. Strong mineral acids like HCl or H₂SO₄ are standard and effective catalysts for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, often requiring heat.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions. The reaction would be very slow or incomplete.\n    *   Therefore, HCl is the more suitable and effective reagent for this transformation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For Reaction 1, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For Reaction 2, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these findings, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
