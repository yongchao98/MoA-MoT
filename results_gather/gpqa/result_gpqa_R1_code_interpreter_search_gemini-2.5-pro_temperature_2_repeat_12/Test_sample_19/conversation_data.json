    "*   **Analyze the Question:** The question asks for the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core concept of this approximation is treating a nucleon bound within a nucleus as if it were a free nucleon during a high-energy interaction.\n\n*   **Evaluate Assumption 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    This is a fundamental part of the approximation. A nucleus is a complex many-body system where interactions can, in principle, involve multiple nucleons at once (e.g., through meson-exchange currents). The impulse approximation simplifies this by assuming the interaction happens with only one nucleon at a time. The total nuclear response is then the incoherent sum of the responses of individual nucleons. This is a crucial step to move from a complex many-body problem to a more tractable single-body problem. This assumption is necessary.\n\n*   **Evaluate Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    This assumption deals with what happens before and after the primary interaction. If the incoming probe (e.g., an electron or a neutrino) or the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons, the final state will be altered. These are called initial-state and final-state interactions (FSI). Assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" means we ignore these effects. The probe enters, hits the target nucleon, and the products leave without any further scattering. This is essential for the observed process to reflect the properties of the interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon. This assumption is necessary.\n\n*   **Evaluate Assumption 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    This assumption describes the internal structure of the nucleon itself, not its behavior within the nucleus. The impulse approximation is a framework for relating a nuclear process to a nucleonic process. The details of that nucleonic process (e.g., whether it's best described by non-relativistic or relativistic quarks) are a separate issue. In fact, in deep inelastic scattering where the impulse approximation is often invoked, the quarks are treated as highly relativistic point-like particles (partons). Therefore, this assumption is not a general requirement for the impulse approximation.\n\n*   **Evaluate Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    This is the heart of the \"impulse\" concept. A nucleon in a nucleus is bound by the strong force, meaning it sits in a potential well. This binding affects its energy and momentum. The impulse approximation posits that the interaction happens over a very short timescaleâ€”so short that the nucleon can be considered \"frozen\" in its state, and the binding potential doesn't have time to act *during* the interaction. The nucleon is hit so hard and fast that it is ejected from the nucleus before it feels the pull of the other nucleons. In essence, at the instant of interaction, its binding energy is negligible compared to the energy transferred. This is the very definition of treating it as a \"free\" particle. This assumption is necessary.\n\n*   **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    The assumptions that collectively define the impulse approximation are:\n    1.  The interaction involves only a single nucleon.\n    2.  There are no initial or final state interactions with the rest of the nucleus (transparency).\n    4.  The nucleon's binding energy is ignored during the short duration of the interaction.\n\n    Assumptions 1, 2, and 4 are the correct set. Assumption 3 is related to the modeling of the nucleon's internal structure, which is a separate consideration from the impulse approximation itself.\n\n*   **Match to Options:** The combination of assumptions 1, 2, and 4 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
