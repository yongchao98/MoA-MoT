    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical situation:** We are asked to find the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) produced by a moving point charge. This is a classic problem in electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key aspect is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. This means the field at an observation point `r` at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, called the retarded time, `tr`.\n\n2.  **Define the key variables based on the problem statement:**\n    *   `q`: the point charge.\n    *   `$\\vec{s}(t')$`: the position vector of the charge at any time `t'`.\n    *   `$\\vec{r}$`: the position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   `t`: the time at which the field is observed at `$\\vec{r}$`.\n    *   `tr`: the retarded time, which is the instant when the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach `$\\vec{r}$` at time `t`.\n    *   `$\\vec{s}(tr)$`: the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   `$\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$`: the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point. Its magnitude is `d = |$\\vec{d}$|`.\n    *   `$\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}(tr)$`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time taken for light to travel the distance `d` is `t - tr`. Thus, `t - tr = d/c`.\n\n3.  **Start with the general formulas for retarded potentials:** The scalar and vector potentials for a general time-varying charge density `ρ` and current density `$\\vec{J}$` are given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where `$\\vec{r}'$` is the source position and `$t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|/c$`.\n\n4.  **Represent the point charge with charge and current densities:** For a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `$\\vec{s}(t')$`, the densities are expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    *   Charge density: `$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$`\n    *   Current density: `$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$`, where `$\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}(t')/dt'$`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the integrals for the potentials:** Substituting the delta-function densities into the potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time `$t_r$` itself depends on the integration variable `$\\vec{r}'$`. The standard derivation involves a careful change of variables or evaluating the integral in the time domain.\n\n    The result of this integration is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    The subscript `tr` means that all quantities inside the brackets (`$\\vec{s}$`, `$\\vec{v}$`) are to be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n6.  **Rewrite the expressions using the notation from the problem:**\n    *   `$\\vec{s} = \\vec{s}(tr)$`\n    *   `$\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(tr)$`\n    *   `$|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}| = |\\vec{d}| = d$`\n    *   `$\\frac{\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|} = \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} = \\hat{d}$`\n\n    Substituting these into the potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\hat{d})} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\hat{d})} = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n7.  **Simplify the denominator to match the options:** To get rid of the fraction in the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n8.  **Compare the derived expressions with the given options:**\n    *   **Option A:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n\n    *   **Option B:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        The sign in the denominator is incorrect. These would be the \"advanced potentials,\" which correspond to waves converging on the charge, a solution that is usually discarded on physical grounds of causality.\n\n    *   **Option C:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        The scalar potential `V` is given as the simple Coulomb potential, which is incorrect because it neglects the retardation effect and the velocity correction factor. It should depend on the retarded distance `d`, not `r`, and include the `$(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)^{-1}$` factor.\n\n    *   **Option D:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        Similar to C, the scalar potential `V` is incorrect. Furthermore, the expression for `$\\vec{A}$` is dimensionally and vectorially incorrect, as `$\\vec{v}^2$` is a scalar.\n\nConclusion: Based on the standard derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, Option A provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>"
