    "A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (usually a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH-Cl.\n    *   The double bond (C=C) makes this part of the molecule planar. All the atoms connected to the C=C double bond lie in the same plane.\n    *   The entire molecule can be considered planar. A planar molecule always has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex, rigid, polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides definitive stereochemical information: (3aR, 7aS, E).\n    *   The descriptors (3aR, 7aS) specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. This indicates that we are dealing with a single stereoisomer.\n    *   For this molecule to be achiral, it would have to be a meso compound, which requires an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   The parent skeleton might possess symmetry, but the substituent \"chloromethylene\" (=CHCl) is itself unsymmetrical (H vs. Cl). The \"E\" designation fixes the geometry.\n    *   The presence of an unsymmetrical substituent on a complex scaffold, combined with the specific (R,S) descriptors for the stereocenters, makes it overwhelmingly likely that the molecule as a whole lacks any internal symmetry.\n    *   A single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The groups attached to C2 (H, CH₃, COOH, and the rest of the molecule) are identical to the groups attached to C3.\n    *   When a molecule has two identical stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds are achiral because they possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   In a staggered conformation (anti-periplanar), (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a center of inversion.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. It has two identical stereocenters (C2 and C3), but both have the same configuration (R,R).\n    *   This molecule is the enantiomer of the (2S,3S) isomer.\n    *   It lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, it is a chiral molecule.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group (at C1).\n    *   Let's check C1 for chirality. The four groups attached to C1 are: -H, -OH, -CH₂(C2)-CH=, and -CH₂(C6)-CH₂-. The two paths around the ring from C1 are different. Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the (R)-configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This compound has three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. The \"(1s,3s,5s)\" notation typically indicates that the three substituents have a *cis* relationship with respect to each other (they are on the same side of the ring's plane).\n    *   In the most stable chair conformation of the all-cis isomer, the three hydroxyl groups occupy axial positions (e.g., all pointing \"up\").\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C₃) and three planes of symmetry. A plane of symmetry can be drawn through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH₂ group.\n    *   Although C1, C3, and C5 are stereocenters, the overall symmetry of the molecule makes it a meso compound and thus achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name corresponds to the structure (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl.\n    *   We need to search for any stereocenters or other elements of chirality.\n    *   The carbon atoms of the cyclopentyl ring are not stereocenters as the ring is unsubstituted and attached symmetrically.\n    *   Let's examine the chain:\n        *   C1 (carbonyl carbon): sp², not a stereocenter.\n        *   C2 (-CH₂-): has two identical H atoms, not a stereocenter.\n        *   C3 (-CH-): is attached to one H atom and two identical methyl (-CH₃) groups, so it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters. Furthermore, the molecule has an accessible conformation that possesses a plane of symmetry bisecting the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
