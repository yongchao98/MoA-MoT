    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring. The existing substituent on the ring determines the position (ortho, meta, or para) of the incoming bromine atom and influences the reaction rate. The question asks to order the substances by the increasing *weight fraction* of the para-isomer. Since the ortho, meta, and para monobrominated products are isomers, they have the same molar mass. Therefore, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the mole fraction (or percentage yield) of the para-isomer.\n\n2.  **Classify the Substituents:** We need to classify each substituent as either an ortho/para-director or a meta-director. This is the primary factor determining the para-isomer yield.\n    *   **Ortho/Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They generally lead to a high yield of the para-isomer. In our list, these are:\n        *   `-CH3` (1, Toluene): Activating alkyl group.\n        *   `-C2H5` (5, Ethylbenzene): Activating alkyl group.\n        *   `-Cl` (3, Chlorobenzene): Deactivating halogen, but still an o,p-director.\n    *   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They produce very small, almost negligible, amounts of the para-isomer. In our list, these are:\n        *   `-NO2` (4, Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating group.\n        *   `-COOH` (6, Benzoic acid): Deactivating group.\n        *   `-COOC2H5` (2, Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating group.\n\n3.  **Establish the Broad Order:** Substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest para-yields, while substances with ortho/para-directing groups will have the highest. Therefore, the order will look like this:\n    (Meta-directors) < (Ortho/para-directors)\n    (4, 6, 2) < (1, 5, 3)\n\n4.  **Order the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2):** For meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is minuscule. The stronger the deactivating/meta-directing effect of the group, the lower the yield of the non-meta isomers (ortho and para). The order of deactivating strength is:\n    `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`\n    Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this:\n    `C6H5-NO2` < `C6H5-COOH` < `C6H5-COOC2H5`\n    In terms of numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n5.  **Order the Ortho/Para-Directors (1, 5, 3):** For these compounds, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho products. This ratio is primarily influenced by two factors:\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent will block the ortho positions more, leading to a higher proportion of the para product. The steric bulk increases in the order: `-Cl` ≈ `-CH3` < `-C2H5`.\n    *   **Electronic Effects:** Activating groups (`-CH3`, `-C2H5`) increase electron density at both ortho and para positions, while the deactivating `-Cl` group withdraws electron density inductively (strongest at the ortho position), making the ortho position less reactive compared to the para position.\n    *   Based on experimental data for bromination:\n        *   **Toluene (1, -CH3):** Yields about 67% para-isomer.\n        *   **Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** Yields about 87% para-isomer. The strong deactivation at the ortho position leads to high para selectivity.\n        *   **Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** Yields about 90-94% para-isomer. The increased steric bulk compared to the methyl group strongly disfavors ortho attack.\n    *   This gives the order of increasing para-yield as:\n        `Toluene` < `Chlorobenzene` < `Ethylbenzene`\n        In terms of numbers: **1 < 3 < 5**\n\n6.  **Combine the Orders:** Now we combine the two groups to get the final sequence:\n    (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)\n    The complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:** Let's check the given options against our derived order.\n    A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect\n    B) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect\n    C) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - This option correctly orders the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) and correctly places the ortho/para directors after them, starting with substance 1. However, it incorrectly orders the last two as `5 < 3` (ethylbenzene < chlorobenzene), while our data shows `3 < 5`.\n    D) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - Incorrect\n\nThere appears to be an error in the provided options, as none perfectly match the sequence derived from established experimental data. However, option C is the \"closest\" to being correct. It accurately arranges the meta-directors and correctly identifies that they produce less para-product than the o,p-directors. The mistake is only in the final two elements. Given the choices, this is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
