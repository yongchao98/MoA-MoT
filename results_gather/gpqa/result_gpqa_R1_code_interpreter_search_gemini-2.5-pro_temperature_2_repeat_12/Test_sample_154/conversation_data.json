    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the operator $P_z$, which is denoted by $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the standard deviation:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    In our case, $A = P_z$, so we need to calculate:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The matrix for the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    *   First, we find the bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, we calculate the action of $P_z$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$\n    So, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    The expectation value is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    *   First, we need to find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n        $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, we calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n    So, the expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $\\hbar^2/2$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    Now we plug the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}}$\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated uncertainty is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$, which matches option C.\n\nThe matrix operations can be verified with Python.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Let's set hbar=1 for the numerical part of the calculation.\nhbar = 1.0\n\n# Define the state vector |psi>\npsi = np.array([[-1/2], [1/np.sqrt(2)], [-1/2]])\n\n# Define the operator P_z\nPz = hbar * np.array([[1, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, -1]])\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of P_z: <psi|P_z|psi>\npsi_dagger = psi.T.conj()\nexp_Pz = (psi_dagger @ Pz @ psi).item()\n\n# Calculate the operator P_z^2\nPz_squared = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of P_z^2: <psi|P_z^2|psi>\nexp_Pz_squared = (psi_dagger @ Pz_squared @ psi).item()\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty Delta P_z\n# (Delta P_z)^2 = <P_z^2> -

The expectation value of $P_z$ is 0. The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $0.5 \\hbar^2 = \\hbar^2/2$. The variance is $\\hbar^2/2$, and the uncertainty (standard deviation) is $\\sqrt{\\hbar^2/2} = \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The goal is to calculate the uncertainty of the operator $P_z$, denoted by $\\Delta P_z$, for the system in the given state.\n\n**1. Formula for Uncertainty**\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta A$ of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the standard deviation:\n$$ \\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2} $$\nIn this problem, we need to compute the uncertainty for the operator $P_z$. Therefore, the formula becomes:\n$$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} $$\nTo find $\\Delta P_z$, we must first calculate the expectation value of $P_z$ (i.e., $\\langle P_z \\rangle$) and the expectation value of $P_z^2$ (i.e., $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$).\n\n**2. Given Information**\nThe state of the system, represented as a column vector (ket), is:\n$$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe corresponding bra vector is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe matrix for the operator $P_z$ is:\n$$ P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**3. Calculation of $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\nThe expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is calculated using the formula $\\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\nFirst, let's find the result of applying the operator $P_z$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$ P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + (-\\hbar) \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we pre-multiply by $\\langle \\psi |$:\n$$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = (-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(0) + (-\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{\\hbar}{2}) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0 $$\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n**4. Calculation of $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\nTo calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$, we first need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$. We obtain this by squaring the matrix for $P_z$:\n$$ P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNext, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$. First, apply $P_z^2$ to $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$ P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, pre-multiply by $\\langle \\psi |$:\n$$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(0) + (-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} $$\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $\\hbar^2/2$.\n\n**5. Calculation of the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\nNow we have all the components to calculate the uncertainty:\n$$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} $$\n$$ \\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
