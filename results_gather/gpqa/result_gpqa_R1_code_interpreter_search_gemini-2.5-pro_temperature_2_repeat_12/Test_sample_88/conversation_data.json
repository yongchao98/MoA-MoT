    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane and excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at high temperature (240°C).\n    *   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). The bromines are at bridgehead positions. Simple elimination to form a double bond at a bridgehead is forbidden by Bredt's rule under normal conditions. However, the harsh conditions (strong base, high temp) suggest a complex reaction, likely involving skeletal rearrangement.\n    *   **Product 1 Spectral Data:**\n        *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong indication of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone in a six-membered or slightly strained ring.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). Total proton count is 14H.\n    *   **Deduction of Product 1 Structure:** The product contains 14 H atoms (same as the starting material) and an oxygen atom (from KOH/water). The formula is likely C₁₀H₁₄O. The IR confirms it's a ketone. This reaction is a known, though not common, transformation. 1,3-dibromoadamantane rearranges under these conditions to form **protoadamantan-4-one** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). The adamantane cage rearranges to the slightly less stable protoadamantane skeleton. While the provided ¹H NMR data is unusual and may not perfectly match standard literature values for this compound, the reaction path is the most chemically plausible one that introduces a ketone group and maintains the C₁₀H₁₄ framework. The subsequent reaction steps confirm that a ketone is the correct intermediate.\n\n2.  **Analyze Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n    *   **Reaction:** Aluminum isopropoxide is the classic reagent for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. The condition \"heated with an excess\" suggests that the reaction may proceed further. Following the reduction of the ketone to an alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol), the heat and Lewis acidic nature of the aluminum alkoxide can catalyze a dehydration reaction (elimination of water) to form an alkene.\n    *   **Deduction of Product 2 Structure:**\n        *   Ketone (Product 1, protoadamantan-4-one) is reduced to the alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol).\n        *   Dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol will form a double bond. Elimination can occur towards C3 (a bridgehead, violating Bredt's rule) or towards C5 (a non-bridgehead position).\n        *   Therefore, elimination occurs towards C5, forming a C4=C5 double bond.\n        *   Product 2 is **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). The presence of a C=C bond is essential for the next step.\n\n3.  **Analyze Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (an alkene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond, and the DMS workup converts the intermediates into aldehydes or ketones.\n    *   **Deduction of Product 3 Structure:**\n        *   Product 2, protoadamant-4-ene, has a double bond between C4 and C5. Both C4 and C5 are methine carbons (each bonded to one hydrogen).\n        *   Cleavage of this C(H)=C(H) bond will result in two aldehyde (-CHO) groups.\n        *   The cleavage opens one of the rings of the protoadamantane skeleton, resulting in a **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane** core structure.\n        *   The original C4 and C5 atoms of the protoadamantene become the aldehyde-bearing carbons in the product. In the resulting bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system, these correspond to positions 3 and 7.\n        *   Therefore, Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern for Product 3**\n    *   **Target Molecule:** bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding those that exchange (like -OH or -NH, which aren't present) and implicitly the aldehyde protons (-CHO). Aldehyde protons are typically the most deshielded (9-10 ppm) but are usually simple singlets and often excluded from such questions.\n    *   The next most deshielded protons will be those alpha to the electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups. These are the methine protons on the carbons to which the aldehyde groups are attached, i.e., H3 and H7.\n    *   Due to the C₂ symmetry of the molecule, H3 and H7 are chemically equivalent. We only need to analyze one of them, for example, H3.\n    *   **Analyze the Neighbors of H3:** The proton H3 is on carbon C3. C3 is bonded to two methylene (CH₂) groups: C2 and C4. Therefore, H3 is coupled to the four protons on these two carbons (two on C2, two on C4).\n    *   **Determine the Splitting Pattern (Coupling):** The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton exists in a rigid double-chair conformation.\n        *   The proton H3 is in an axial-like position.\n        *   It couples to the two adjacent axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) with a large coupling constant (J_axial-axial ≈ 10-13 Hz). These two equivalent couplings split the signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   It also couples to the two adjacent equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) with a small coupling constant (J_axial-equatorial ≈ 2-4 Hz). These two equivalent couplings further split each line of the initial triplet into another **triplet**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n*   **A) doublet of triplets:** Would mean coupling to one proton and a group of two protons.\n*   **B) triplet of triplets:** Would mean coupling to two distinct groups of two protons each. This matches our analysis.\n*   **C) pentet:** Would mean coupling to four magnetically equivalent protons (i.e., all J values are the same). This is not the case in a rigid chair.\n*   **D) triplet:** Would mean coupling to only two equivalent protons.\n\nThe correct coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>"
