    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the *gas molecules themselves*. It describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with *another gas molecule*. The system consists of randomly moving gas molecules.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the *electrons from the beam*. It describes the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a *gas molecule*. The system consists of a high-velocity, directional electron beam traveling through a sparse medium of relatively stationary gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Mean Free Path Formula**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of gas molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision/scattering cross-section. This represents the effective area that one particle presents to another for a \"collision\" to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to Both Scenarios**\n    *   For **λ1 (gas-gas collision)**:\n        The standard kinetic theory formula for a gas is λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas).\n        *   `n` is the density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gas-gas` is the kinetic cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. This is roughly based on the physical size of the molecules (like two billiard balls colliding).\n        *   The `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of the colliding gas molecules.\n\n    *   For **λ2 (electron-gas collision)**:\n        The formula is λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas).\n        *   `n` is the same density of gas molecules, as they are the targets.\n        *   `σ_e-gas` is the scattering cross-section for an electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n        *   Note: The `√2` factor is absent because the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds (accelerated by 1000 kV), while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. The gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets from the electron's perspective.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n    This is the core of the problem. We need to compare `σ_gas-gas` with `σ_e-gas`.\n\n    *   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ_gas-gas):** This interaction is largely a \"hard-sphere\" collision, governed by van der Waals forces. The interaction range is short, and the cross-section is related to the physical, geometric size of the molecule.\n\n    *   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (σ_e-gas):** This interaction is fundamentally different. The electron is a charged particle, and it interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron is scattered by both the negatively charged electron cloud and the positively charged nucleus of the gas molecule. Because the Coulomb force has a very long range, an electron can be significantly deflected (which counts as a scattering event) even if it passes relatively far from the \"physical\" boundary of the gas molecule.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Cross-Sections:** The effective area for scattering an electron (due to the long-range Coulomb force) is much larger than the effective area for two neutral gas molecules to collide (which requires them to get very close to each other).\n    Therefore: **σ_e-gas > σ_gas-gas**\n\n5.  **Final Deduction**\n    *   We have the relationships:\n        *   λ1 is inversely proportional to σ_gas-gas (and n).\n        *   λ2 is inversely proportional to σ_e-gas (and n).\n    *   The number density `n` is the same in both scenarios.\n    *   Since σ_e-gas is significantly larger than σ_gas-gas, the corresponding mean free path λ2 must be significantly smaller than λ1.\n    *   If σ_e-gas > σ_gas-gas, then 1/(n * σ_e-gas) < 1/(n * σ_gas-gas).\n    *   Even accounting for the √2 factor in the λ1 equation, the much larger electrostatic cross-section for the electron ensures this inequality holds.\n    *   Therefore, we can firmly conclude that **λ2 < λ1**.\n\nThis aligns with the practical reason for needing an ultra-high vacuum in an electron microscope: electrons are very easily scattered by residual gas molecules (large cross-section, short mean free path), which would otherwise degrade the beam and the resulting image.\n\n<<<D>>>"
