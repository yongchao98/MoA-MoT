    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`.\n        *   This name describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across the C1-C6 bond. The \"7-oxa\" indicates the oxygen atom of the epoxide.\n        *   Methyl groups are located at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n        *   The stereochemistry is specified as `(1R,3R,4R,6S)`.\n    *   **Reagent:** The reagent is `Me2CuLi`, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. The active nucleophile is the methyl anion equivalent, `Me-`.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack:**\n    *   The prompt states a key rule for this reaction: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by the oxygen atom bridging carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached to it (`1,3,4-trimethyl...`).\n    *   Carbon C6 has only a hydrogen atom attached (besides the ring carbons).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon.\n    *   The methyl nucleophile (`Me-`) from `Me2CuLi` will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Connectivity and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The nucleophilic attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. Subsequently, the C1-O bond cleaves upon workup to form a hydroxyl group (-OH) at C1.\n    *   The resulting product is a substituted cyclohexane ring with the following groups:\n        *   At the original C1: an -OH group and the original methyl group.\n        *   At the original C6: a new methyl group from the reagent.\n        *   At the original C3: a methyl group.\n        *   At the original C4: a methyl group.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we first identify the principal functional group, which is the alcohol (-OH). The carbon it is attached to (original C1) becomes C1 in the product's name.\n    *   We then number the ring to give the other substituents (the four methyl groups) the lowest possible locants.\n        *   Methyl groups are located at the new C1, the new C2 (original C6), the new C4 (original C4), and the new C5 (original C3).\n        *   Numbering CCW from C1: Me at C1, Me at C2 (old C6), Me at C4 (old C4), Me at C5 (old C3). The locant set is (1,2,4,5).\n        *   Numbering CW from C1: Me at C1, Me at C6 (old C2), Me at C3 (old C4), Me at C4 (old C3). The new Me from attack would be at C6. This is more complex and gives a higher locant set (1,3,4,6).\n    *   The lowest locant set is (1,2,4,5). The product name is `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The prompt provides another crucial rule: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" The reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism.\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations are retained. In the renumbered product, this means:\n        *   The configuration at new C5 (original C3) remains **R**.\n        *   The configuration at new C4 (original C4) remains **R**.\n    *   The stereocenter at C1 is also not inverted because the bonds to the chiral center atom are not broken during the O-H formation (the C1-O bond breaks, not the bonds to the C1 atom itself). So its configuration is retained:\n        *   The configuration at new C1 (original C1) remains **R**.\n    *   The stereocenter at C6 is attacked by the nucleophile, and its configuration is inverted.\n        *   Original configuration at C6 is **S**.\n        *   We must determine the resulting configuration at this carbon (now C2 in the product). This requires a careful analysis of the effect of inversion on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) descriptor when the substituents change.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Inversion at C6 -> C2:**\n    *   **Reactant (C6):** Ligands in descending CIP priority order are: L1(O), L2(C1), L3(C5), L4(H). The configuration is **S**. This means when viewing from L4(H), the path L1(O) → L2(C1) → L3(C5) is counter-clockwise (CCW).\n    *   **Reaction (Inversion):** Geometric inversion means that the spatial orientation of the three remaining ligands (C1, C5, H) relative to the incoming nucleophile (Me) is inverted. From the perspective of H (L4), the spatial path of the other three ligands becomes clockwise (CW). So, the path for the sequence (Me, C1, C5) is now CW.\n    *   **Product (C2):** The ligands are now: Me (from reagent), C1(new), C3(new, from old C5), and H.\n    *   **Priorities at C2:** The CIP priorities for the product at C2 are: P'1(C1_new) > P'2(C3_new) > P'3(Me) > P'4(H).\n    *   **Determining the final configuration:** We need to find the orientation of the path P'1 → P'2 → P'3, which is C1_new → C3_new → Me.\n    *   We know from the inversion that the spatial path for (Me → C1_new → C3_new) is CW.\n    *   The path we want is a cyclic permutation of this. Let A=Me, B=C1_new, C=C3_new. We know the path A→B→C is CW. The path we need is B→C→A. A cyclic permutation preserves the orientation. Therefore, the path B→C→A is also CW.\n    *   So, the path for the new priorities P'1 → P'2 → P'3 is CW.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (H) in the back, a CW path corresponds to an **R** configuration.\n    *   Thus, the configuration at C2 in the product is **R**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The final product is `(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
