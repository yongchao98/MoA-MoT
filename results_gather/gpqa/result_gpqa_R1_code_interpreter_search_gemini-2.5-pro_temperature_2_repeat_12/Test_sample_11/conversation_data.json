    "This problem can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   The positive pion (Pi+) is at rest.\n*   Initial momentum, p_initial = 0.\n*   Initial total energy, E_initial, is its rest energy: E_initial = m_π * c²\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   The pion decays into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n*   Let the momentum of the muon be p_μ and the neutrino be p_ν.\n*   Let the total energy of the muon be E_μ and the neutrino be E_ν.\n\n**3. Conservation of Momentum:**\n*   The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   p_initial = p_μ + p_ν\n*   0 = p_μ + p_ν\n*   This means p_μ = -p_ν. The particles fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n*   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**4. Conservation of Energy:**\n*   The total energy before equals the total energy after.\n*   E_initial = E_μ + E_ν\n*   m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)²\n\n*   For the muon: E_μ = sqrt((pc)² + (m_μ*c²)²)\n*   For the neutrino: Neutrinos have negligible mass, so we can assume m_ν = 0.\n    *   Therefore, E_ν = sqrt((pc)² + 0) = pc. The neutrino's total energy is equal to its kinetic energy.\n    *   KE_ν = E_ν = pc\n\n**5. Solving for the energies:**\nSubstitute the expressions for energy back into the conservation equation:\nm_π * c² = sqrt((pc)² + (m_μ*c²)²) + pc\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for 'pc':\nm_π*c² - pc = sqrt((pc)² + (m_μ*c²)²)\n\nSquare both sides:\n(m_π*c² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n(m_π*c²)² - 2(m_π*c²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\nCancel the (pc)² term from both sides:\n(m_π*c²)² - 2(m_π*c²)(pc) = (m_μ*c²)²\n\nSolve for pc:\n(m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² = 2(m_π*c²)(pc)\npc = [(m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)²] / [2 * m_π * c²]\n\nWe can now calculate the value of pc (which is also the kinetic energy of the neutrino, KE_ν) using the given rest masses. We can then find the kinetic energy of the muon.\n\nLet's use Python to compute the values precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest masses in MeV/c^2. We can treat them as energy units (MeV) in the calculation.\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# Calculate pc (which is equal to the neutrino's kinetic energy)\n# pc = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\npc = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total energy released is the Q-value, which is the sum of the kinetic energies.\n# Q = m_pi - m_mu = KE_mu + KE_nu\n# So, KE_mu = m_pi - m_mu - KE_nu\n# A more direct way is using energy conservation: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu\n# m_pi = E_mu + KE_nu => E_mu = m_pi - KE_nu\n# And KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\nE_mu = m_pi - KE_nu\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\nprint(f\"KE of mu(+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of nu: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\nKE of mu(+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of nu: 29.78 MeV\n<<<\nThe calculated kinetic energy for the muon (mu+) is 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy for the neutrino (nu) is approximately 29.8 MeV.\n\nComparing this with the options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). We can solve this using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity.\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The Pi(+) is at rest.\n    *   Initial Momentum ($p_i$): 0\n    *   Initial Energy ($E_i$): The rest energy of the pion, $E_i = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n\n*   **Final State:** The products are a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n    *   Let the momentum of the muon be $p_{\\mu}$ and the momentum of the neutrino be $p_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Let the total energy of the muon be $E_{\\mu}$ and the total energy of the neutrino be $E_{\\nu}$.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before and after the decay must be equal.\n    $p_i = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu}$\n    $0 = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu} \\implies p_{\\mu} = -p_{\\nu}$\n    This means the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude. Let this magnitude be $p$. So, $|p_{\\mu}| = |p_{\\nu}| = p$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before and after the decay must be equal.\n    $E_i = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n**3. Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) for a particle is given by:\n$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n\n*   For the muon ($\\mu^+$):\n    $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n\n*   For the neutrino ($\\nu$):\n    The rest mass of a neutrino is considered to be zero ($m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$).\n    $E_{\\nu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (0)^2 \\implies E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n    For a massless particle, its total energy is its kinetic energy, so $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n**4. Solve for the Energies**\n\nSubstitute the energy expressions back into the energy conservation equation:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\nNow, we solve for the momentum term, $pc$:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\nCancel the $(pc)^2$ term from both sides:\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\nRearrange to solve for $pc$:\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 = 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc)$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Rest mass of Pi+ ($m_{\\pi}c^2$): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of mu+ ($m_{\\mu}c^2$): 105.7 MeV\n\nFirst, calculate the neutrino's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\nu} = pc$):\n$KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNext, calculate the muon's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\mu}$). We know the total energy released is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products:\n$KE_{\\text{total}} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\nNote: This is incorrect. This formula is for the *Q-value* of a decay, but energy is not just kinetic when particles have rest mass. The total energy released is $m_{\\pi}c^2$, which is split between the rest energy and kinetic energy of the muon, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino.\n\nThe correct way is using energy conservation again:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} = (KE_{\\mu} + m_{\\mu}c^2) + KE_{\\nu}$\n$KE_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$\n$KE_{\\mu} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} - 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n$KE_{\\mu} = 4.1 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe Python script from the reasoning step confirms these calculations precisely:\nKE of mu(+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of nu: 29.78 MeV (which rounds to 29.8 MeV)\n\nComparing our calculated values (KE_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV, KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV) with the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
