    "I need to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\nT_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) * R_star^2 / (4 * a^2) )^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star = Star's temperature\n*   R_star = Star's radius\n*   A = Planet's albedo\n*   a = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit)\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2.\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [T_star * ( (1 - A_4) * R_star^2 / (4 * a_4^2) )^(1/4)] / [T_star * ( (1 - A_2) * R_star^2 / (4 * a_2^2) )^(1/4)]\n\nSince the planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem states that the albedo (A) is the same for all planets (A_4 = A_2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1 / a_4^2)^(1/4) / (1 / a_2^2)^(1/4)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a_2^2 / a_4^2)^(1/4)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(2/4)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)\n\nThis shows the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law:**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a):\nT^2 ∝ a^3\n\nWe can write this as a ratio for two planets:\n(a_2 / a_4)^3 = (T_2 / T_4)^2\n\nTo find the ratio a_2 / a_4, we take the cube root of both sides:\na_2 / a_4 = (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3)\n\n**3. Substitute and Calculate:**\n\nNow, substitute the expression for (a_2 / a_4) back into our temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3) )\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T_2 / T_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T_2 / T_4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as T1 : T2 : T3 : T4 : T5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\nFrom this, we have:\n*   T_2 is proportional to 2.\n*   T_4 is proportional to 3.5.\n\nTherefore, the ratio T_2 / T_4 = 2 / 3.5.\n\nNow we can calculate the final value.\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods T2/T4\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, which is (T2/T4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its orbital distance (semi-major axis, *a*) by the formula:\nT_eq ∝ (1/a^2)^(1/4) = a^(-1/2)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a_4 / a_2)^(-1/2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (*a*):\nP^2 ∝ a^3  or  a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nWe can substitute this relationship into our temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = ( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3)*(1/2))\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem states that the orbital periods have a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5, respectively. Thus:\n*   P_2 is proportional to 2.\n*   P_4 is proportional to 3.5.\n\nThe ratio P_2 / P_4 is therefore 2 / 3.5.\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
