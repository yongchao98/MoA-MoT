    "The user wants to determine the value of the constant 'a' for a given wave function.\n\n**1. Understand the physical principle:**\nThe problem describes a particle whose state is given by a wave function, ψ(x). In quantum mechanics, the probability of finding the particle in a certain region of space is determined by the integral of the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that region. The probability density is the square of the modulus of the wave function.\n\nThe problem states that the particle is always found between x=1 and x=3. This means the probability of finding the particle in this interval is 100%, or 1. This is the normalization condition for the wave function over the specified domain.\n\nThe normalization condition is expressed as:\n∫[from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n**2. Define the wave function and its complex conjugate:**\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe complex conjugate, ψ*(x), is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\n**3. Calculate the probability density, |ψ(x)|²:**\nThe probability density is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate:\n|ψ(x)|² = ψ(x) * ψ*(x)\n|ψ(x)|² = [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ] * [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i ]\n\nUsing the algebraic identity (u - v)(u + v) = u² - v², where u = (a/sqrt(1+x)) and v = 0.5i:\n|ψ(x)|² = (a/sqrt(1+x))² - (0.5i)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1+x) - (0.25 * i²)\n\nSince i² = -1:\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1+x) - (0.25 * -1)\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1+x) + 0.25\n\n**4. Set up and solve the normalization integral:**\nNow we integrate the probability density from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1:\n∫[from 1 to 3] ( a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\nLet's evaluate the integral:\n∫ ( a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ) dx = a² * ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx + 0.25 * ∫ dx\nThe result of the indefinite integral is: a² * ln(1+x) + 0.25x\n\nNow, apply the limits of integration [1, 3]:\n[ a² * ln(1+x) + 0.25x ] from 1 to 3\n= ( a² * ln(1+3) + 0.25*3 ) - ( a² * ln(1+1) + 0.25*1 )\n= ( a² * ln(4) + 0.75 ) - ( a² * ln(2) + 0.25 )\n= a² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) + 0.75 - 0.25\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\n**5. Solve for 'a':**\nWe set the result of the integral equal to 1:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\na_squared = 0.5 / math.log(2)\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\nprint(a)\n```\n> 실행 결과\n```\n0.8493266539955749\n```\nThe calculated value of 'a' is approximately 0.8493.

    "The problem asks to find the value of the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function ψ(x), with the condition that the particle is always found in the interval [1, 3].\n\n**1. Normalization Condition**\nIn quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a given region of space is determined by its wave function. The total probability of finding the particle anywhere it can exist must be 1 (or 100%). This is known as the normalization condition. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nwhere the integral is taken over all possible positions of the particle.\n\nIn this case, we are told that the particle is only found between x = 1 and x = 3. Therefore, the normalization condition becomes:\n∫[from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n**2. Calculate the Probability Density |ψ(x)|²**\nThe probability density, |ψ(x)|², is the product of the wave function ψ(x) and its complex conjugate ψ*(x).\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i\n\nThe complex conjugate is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nψ*(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i\n\nNow, we multiply them:\n|ψ(x)|² = ψ(x) * ψ*(x)\n|ψ(x)|² = [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i ]\n\nUsing the algebraic identity (u - v)(u + v) = u² - v², where u = a / sqrt(1 + x) and v = 0.5i:\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² - (0.5i)²\nSince i² = -1:\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**3. Set up and Evaluate the Integral**\nNow we plug this expression into our normalization condition:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nLet's evaluate the definite integral:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx\n= [a² * ln|1 + x|] evaluated from 1 to 3 + [0.25x] evaluated from 1 to 3\n= (a² * ln(1 + 3) - a² * ln(1 + 1)) + (0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1)\n= (a² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25)\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\n**4. Solve for 'a'**\nWe set the result of the integral equal to 1:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n\nThe value of ln(2) is approximately 0.693.\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214) ≈ 0.8493\n\nThe calculated value of 'a' is approximately 0.8493. This matches the result from the code execution. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 0.35\nB) 0.85\nC) 1.1\nD) 0.6\n\nThe value 0.85 is the closest to our calculated result.\n\n<<<B>>>"
