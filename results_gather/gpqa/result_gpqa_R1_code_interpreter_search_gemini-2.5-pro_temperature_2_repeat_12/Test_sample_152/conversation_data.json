These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nB) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nC) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nD) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions:\n\n### Reaction A:\n**dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants**:\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile)**: Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic proton on the α-carbon (the carbon between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂].\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile)**: Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the one attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition)**:\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is another enolate, [p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃], which is stabilized by resonance.\n    *   This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine Product (A)**:\n    *   The final product structure is p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃.\n    *   To name this using the \"propane-tricarboxylate\" system, we identify the main 3-carbon chain linking the carboxylate groups.\n    *   The structure can be seen as: (MeOOC)₂-C¹H - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂-COOMe.\n    *   Numbering this chain C1-C2-C3, we have:\n        *   Two methyl carboxylate groups on C1.\n        *   A p-tolyl group on C2.\n        *   One methyl carboxylate group on C3.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants**:\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile)**: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a neutral enolate equivalent (a Stork enamine). The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine double bond (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile)**: (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation)**:\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a new C-C bond.\n    *   The final step involves hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone) and protonates the piperidine, removing it from the molecule.\n\n3.  **Determine Product (B)**:\n    *   The starting enamine was formed from cyclohexanone. The reaction regenerates a ketone, so the product is a substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   The substituent is attached at the α-position (C2) relative to the new carbonyl group.\n    *   The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile: -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN group at C2.\n    *   The IUPAC name is based on the butanenitrile chain, with a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group at position 3. So the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, most stable product after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C:\n**C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the transformation**: We are given the product and need to identify the Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product**: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This means a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring has a (3-oxobutyl) group, -CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃, attached at its C2 position.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃. In a Michael addition, this becomes the -CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃ group.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Reactant C)**: The reaction forms a C-C bond between the C2 of the dione and the β-carbon of MVK. This means the nucleophile was an enolate formed at the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. The proton at C2 is highly acidic as it is flanked by two carbonyl groups.\n\n2.  **Determine Reactant (C)**:\n    *   The nucleophile is generated by deprotonating reactant C with the base (KOH).\n    *   Since the core of the product is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and the C2 position acted as the nucleophile, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   **A**: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B**: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C**: cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing this with the given options, we find that all three match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
