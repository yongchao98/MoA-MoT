    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the System\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they have half-integer spin, they are fermions.\n*   **Principle:** Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Potential:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Quantum State:** For a particle in this potential, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (m_s = +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\n### 2. Single-Particle Energy Levels\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by the formula:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on...\n\nEach energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two fermions: one with spin-up and one with spin-down, because the states `(n, +1/2)` and `(n, -1/2)` are distinct.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_g)\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy for the system of four particles. To achieve this, we fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** This is the lowest energy level (E₁ = E). We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contribution = 2 * E₁ = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** This is the next lowest energy level (E₂ = 4E). We place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contribution = 2 * E₂ = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n$E_g = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n### 4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\nThe first excited state is the state with the next lowest total energy after the ground state. We can find this by promoting one particle from the ground state configuration to the lowest available unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground state configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2. The highest occupied energy level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied energy level is n=3.\n*   **Promotion:** We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **New configuration:**\n    *   Two particles remain in n=1 (Energy: 2 * E₁ = 2E).\n    *   One particle remains in n=2 (Energy: 1 * E₂ = 4E).\n    *   One particle is now in n=3 (Energy: 1 * E₃ = 9E).\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the third-lowest total energy. We need to consider different possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and find the one with the next lowest energy increase.\n\nLet's list the possible low-energy configurations and their total energies:\n*   **Ground State:** {n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2}. Energy = 10E.\n*   **First Excitation:** Promote a particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: {n=1, n=1, n=2, n=3}.\n    *   Energy = 2*E₁ + 1*E₂ + 1*E₃ = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. (This is the First Excited State).\n*   **Next Possible Excitation:** Let's consider other promotions from the ground state.\n    *   **Option A:** Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: {n=1, n=2, n=2, n=3}.\n        *   Energy = 1*E₁ + 2*E₂ + 1*E₃ = E + 2*(4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n    *   **Option B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: {n=1, n=1, n=3, n=3}.\n        *   Energy = 2*E₁ + 2*E₃ = 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E,...), the third lowest energy for the system is 18E.\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\n$E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
