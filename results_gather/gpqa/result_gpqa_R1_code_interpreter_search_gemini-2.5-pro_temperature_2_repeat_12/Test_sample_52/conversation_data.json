    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Features:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This strongly suggests a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms are replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy:** An ester group is present. The general structure of an ester is R-COO-R', which contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and a C-O single bond.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:** This is the most detailed information for structure elucidation.\n        *   **Six total signals:** Indicates six chemically distinct types of protons.\n        *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons is characteristic of a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern, especially with two electronically different substituents. This accounts for 4 protons (C6**H4**).\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to a carbon with no hydrogens (like the aromatic ring). Let's denote the group as Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   H(a) is split by H(b), resulting in a doublet. (1H)\n            *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. (1H)\n            *   This confirms the presence of a **-CH=CH-CH3** group, which contains 1 vinyl H, 1 vinyl H, and 3 methyl H's.\n        *   **Two –CH3 group signals:** This means there are two non-equivalent methyl groups in the molecule. One is the methyl from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**). The other must belong to the ester substituent.\n        *   **No –CH2 group signals:** This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates many possibilities, such as an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or a propoxy group (-OCH2CH2CH3).\n\n2.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments:**\n    *   **Fragment 1:** A para-substituted benzene ring (**C6H4**).\n    *   **Fragment 2:** A propenyl group (**-C3H5**).\n    *   **Fragment 3:** An ester substituent that contains the second methyl group and has no -CH2- groups. There are two simple possibilities:\n        *   An acetate group attached through oxygen: **-O-CO-CH3** (an acetoxy group).\n        *   A methyl ester group attached through carbon: **-CO-O-CH3** (a methoxycarbonyl group).\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula by Combining Fragments:**\n    *   **Case A:** The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the methoxycarbonyl group.\n        *   Molecule: Methyl propenylbenzoate, CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3\n        *   Formula Calculation: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + C2H3O2 (methoxycarbonyl) = **C11H12O2**.\n        *   Let's re-calculate that. C6H4 + C3H5 + COOCH3 = C(6+3+1) H(4+5+3) O2 = **C10H12O2**. This formula is not among the choices.\n\n    *   **Case B:** The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the acetoxy group.\n        *   Molecule: Propenylphenyl acetate, CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3\n        *   Formula Calculation: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + C2H3O2 (acetoxy) = C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O2 = **C11H12O2**.\n        *   This formula matches option D.\n\n4.  **Verify the chosen structure and formula (C11H12O2):**\n    *   **Formula:** C11H12O2. This is option D.\n    *   **Consistency Check:** The proposed structure, propenylphenyl acetate, has a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester group, no -CH2- groups, and fits the NMR data perfectly:\n        *   Two aromatic signals (para-substitution).\n        *   Two vinyl signals (doublet and doublet of quartets for the propenyl group).\n        *   Two methyl signals (a doublet from the propenyl group and a singlet from the acetate group).\n        *   Total of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.\n    *   The structure is fully consistent with all provided spectroscopic data.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Other Formula Options:**\n    *   **C11H14O2 and C12H12O2:** The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for these formulas does not match the required structural elements (a benzene ring, a C=C bond, and a C=O bond, requiring DBE=4+1+1=6).\n        *   DBE(C11H14O2) = 11 + 1 - 14/2 = 5. (Incorrect)\n        *   DBE(C12H12O2) = 12 + 1 - 12/2 = 7. (Incorrect)\n    *   **C12H14O2:** The DBE is 6, which is consistent. However, to get this formula from the known fragments (C6H4, C3H5, an ester with a CH3, no CH2), we would need to add CH2. For instance, `p-propenylphenyl propionate`, (CH3CH=CH)-C6H4-O-CO-**CH2**CH3. This structure contains a -CH2- group, which contradicts the given NMR data. It's not possible to construct an isomer of C12H14O2 that fits all the NMR constraints.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that allows for a structure perfectly matching all the spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
