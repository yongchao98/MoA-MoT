    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to compute the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2 ($L_1 / L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Luminosity:** The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $A$ is the surface area of the star ($A = 4\\pi R^2$ for a sphere).\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the surface temperature of the star.\n    Substituting the area, the formula becomes:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the formula above, the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2 is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:**\n    *   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2: $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    *   The mass information ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not directly used in the Stefan-Boltzmann law and can be considered extraneous for this calculation.\n    *   The radial velocities are $v_1 = 0$ km/s and $v_2 = 700$ km/s.\n    *   The \"wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" This refers to the observed peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max, obs}$) of their blackbody spectra. So, $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\n\n5.  **Relate Temperature to Wavelength:** According to Wien's Displacement Law, the intrinsic surface temperature ($T$) of a black body is related to its *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max, emit}$):\n    $\\lambda_{max, emit} = \\frac{b}{T}$\n    where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n\n6.  **Account for the Doppler Effect:** The radial velocity of a star causes a Doppler shift, changing the wavelength of light we observe.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so the observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Conventionally, a positive radial velocity indicates the star is moving away from us (recession), which causes a redshift (observed wavelength is longer). The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$\n        Therefore, $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):** We can now find the relationship between the temperatures of the two stars.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{max, emit, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n    *   Now, substitute Wien's Law ($ \\lambda_{max, emit} = b/T $):\n        $\\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n    *   Solving for the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$:\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula from step 3:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}\\right)^4$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^2$\n\n9.  **Perform the Calculation:** We use the given values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and the speed of light $c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s.\n\n    The ratio $v_2/c$ is:\n    $v_2/c = 700 / 299792.458 \\approx 0.00233496$\n\n    Now, substitute this value into the expression for the luminosity ratio:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1 - 0.00233496}{1 + 0.00233496}\\right)^2$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{0.99766504}{1.00233496}\\right)^2$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (0.9953406)^2$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times 0.9907034$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.22908$\n\n10. **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of ~2.23 is closest to option A.\n\n    If we had assumed astronomers corrected for the Doppler shift and that the *emitted* peak wavelengths were the same, then $T_1$ would equal $T_2$, and the ratio would be exactly $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$. However, the wording \"appeared brightest\" and the explicit inclusion of the radial velocity values suggest that the Doppler shift must be accounted for. The small but definite difference between 2.25 and 2.23 is the key to solving this problem.\n\n<<<A>>>"
