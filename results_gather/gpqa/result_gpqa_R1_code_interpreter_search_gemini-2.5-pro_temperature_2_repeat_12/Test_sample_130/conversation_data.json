    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and the Reaction.**\n    *   The first reactant is described as a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene which dehydrates to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given: a single peak at 7 ppm in ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in ¹³C NMR.\n        *   The dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid like maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n        *   Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, which would give a single peak in the ¹H NMR. The value of ~7 ppm is characteristic of deshielded alkene protons adjacent to carbonyl groups.\n        *   It also has two types of carbons: two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This would give two signals in the ¹³C NMR. The shifts of ~137 ppm (alkene) and ~165 ppm (carbonyl) are consistent with this structure.\n        *   Therefore, the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry.**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring. When a cyclic diene reacts with a dienophile, it forms a bicyclic system. In this case, the product is a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene.\n    *   The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is consistent with the addition of C₉H₁₄ (the diene) and C₄H₂O₃ (the anhydride).\n    *   The reaction can produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct. This accounts for the major and minor products mentioned.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Typically, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital overlap in the transition state. The *endo* product is the kinetic product.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance Exception:** However, the diene used here is heavily substituted with four methyl groups. In the *endo* transition state, where the dienophile (maleic anhydride) tucks \"under\" the diene, there would be significant steric repulsion between the anhydride and the methyl groups on the diene. In such cases of severe steric hindrance, the *exo* transition state is lower in energy, and the *exo* product becomes the major product. This is a crucial exception to the general endo rule.\n    *   Therefore, we can hypothesize:\n        *   **Major product = *Exo* isomer**\n        *   **Minor product = *Endo* isomer**\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products and Predict the NMR Signals.**\n    *   Let's analyze the general structure of the product: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride. Due to a plane of symmetry passing through the C7 bridge and the middle of the C2=C3 and C5-C6 bonds, several groups of protons are equivalent.\n    *   We expect the following signals in the ¹H NMR:\n        *   **`Me(alkene)`:** The methyl groups on the double bond (at C2 and C3) are equivalent. They would appear as a **6H singlet**. Vinylic methyls typically resonate around 1.6-2.0 ppm.\n        *   **`Me(bridgehead)`:** The methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (at C1 and C4) are equivalent. They would appear as another **6H singlet**. These alkyl methyls would resonate further upfield, around 1.0 ppm.\n        *   **`H(anhydride)`:** The protons on the anhydride part of the ring (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and are deshielded. They should appear as a **2H singlet**, likely downfield (~3-4 ppm).\n        *   **`H(bridge)`:** The two protons of the CH₂ group at C7 are diastereotopic and would give more complex signals, likely two separate 1H multiplets.\n    *   Matching the expected signals with those in the options:\n        *   `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm` corresponds to **`Me(alkene)`**.\n        *   `6H singlet at ~1 ppm` corresponds to **`Me(bridgehead)`**.\n        *   `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` corresponds to **`H(anhydride)`**.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data.**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a key cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons whose spatial proximity is different in the *exo* and *endo* isomers.\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Major Product):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (away) from the C7 bridge. This places the anhydride protons `H(anhydride)` on the same face of the bicyclic system as the C2=C3 double bond. Consequently, the `H(anhydride)` protons are **close** to the **`Me(alkene)`** groups. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Minor Product):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (towards) the C7 bridge. This places the `H(anhydride)` protons on the opposite face from the C2=C3 double bond. The `H(anhydride)` protons are **far** from the **`Me(alkene)`** groups. No NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   This analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation: the cross-peak is present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product. The cross-peak is between the `H(anhydride)` protons and the `Me(alkene)` protons.\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Answer.**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects the `H(anhydride)` protons and the `Me(alkene)` protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments in step 3:\n        *   `H(anhydride)` resonates as a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n        *   `Me(alkene)` resonates as a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   We need to find the option that lists these two resonances.\n\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\n    Option D correctly identifies the two resonances that are connected by the unique cross-peak in the major product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
