Based on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, a clear and unanimous consensus exists on the physical principles, the required formulas, and the final numerical result. The slight variation in the letter choices among the candidate answers is an artifact of their systems processing the options in different orders; their underlying analysis and numerical conclusion are identical and correct.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem involves a supernova ejecta moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. This speed is 20% of the speed of light (`c` ≈ 300,000 km/s), so `v = 0.2c`. At such high speeds, comparing measurements between different inertial frames (the ejecta and the Galaxy) requires the use of Special Relativity, not classical physics. The specific phenomenon at play is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The reference frame of the Galaxy. The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The reference frame of the ejecta.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`)**: The given time interval, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame of the ejecta. This is the \"proper time.\"\n    *   **Dilated Time (`Δt`)**: The time interval corresponding to the 50s of proper time, but as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n3.  **Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**: This logical approach can often solve the problem without requiring a full calculation.\n    *   **Calculate the Classical Distance**: First, calculate the distance if we were to ignore relativistic effects. This provides a baseline.\n        `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n        This value corresponds to option **D** in the problem statement.\n    *   **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation**: The theory of time dilation states that a moving clock is observed to run slower than a stationary clock. This means that while 50 seconds (`Δt₀`) pass for the ejecta, a *longer* time (`Δt`) must have passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   **Draw a Logical Conclusion**: The distance we need to find is the one measured in the Galaxy's frame, calculated as `d = v × Δt`. Since the velocity `v` is constant and the time `Δt` is greater than `50 s`, the resulting distance `d` **must be greater than** the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n    *   **Examine the Options**: Looking at the options provided in the question:\n        A) 3 060 000 km (**Greater** than 3,000,000 km)\n        B) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km)\n        C) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km)\n        D) 3 000 000 km (The classical result itself)\n    *   This sanity check alone is sufficient to identify **A** as the only physically possible answer.\n\n4.  **Perform the Quantitative Calculation for Confirmation**:\n    The distance in the stationary frame `d` is given by `d = v × Δt`. The dilated time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n    The combined formula is: `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    *   Plug in the known values:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s × 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 `\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**: The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **A) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from the qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativity vs. Classical Physics**: The most critical first step is recognizing that the speed (20% of light speed) is relativistic, making a classical calculation incorrect. The classical answer (`3,000,000 km`) is intentionally included as a distractor.\n*   **Correctly Identifying Proper Time**: A common pitfall in relativity problems is misidentifying the given time. The `50 s` interval is the **proper time** (`Δt₀`) because it is measured by a clock in the same frame as the event's duration (i.e., on the moving ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation Implication**: Time *dilation* means the time measured by the stationary observer is *longer*, which in turn means the distance measured (`d = v × Δt`) is *greater* than the classical distance. Understanding this directionality is key to the sanity check.\n*   **Time Dilation, Not Length Contraction**: The problem is correctly solved by using time dilation because we start with a time interval in one frame and need to calculate a distance in another. This involves finding the corresponding (dilated) time in the observer's frame. Length contraction is a different, though related, phenomenon.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a remarkable consensus. All 15 agents correctly identified the core physics, used the correct formula, and arrived at the same numerical result. The only discrepancy was the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D), which indicates that the options were presented to them in a different order. This universal agreement on the methodology and result provides very high confidence in the final answer.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis synthesized from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is therefore `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% the speed of light. Because this velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light, classical physics is not sufficient. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key phenomenon is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The given time, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time,\" as it is measured by a clock at rest relative to the events it is timing.\n*   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** `60,000 km/s`.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**\nThis logical analysis is a powerful tool used by almost all the agents and can often solve the problem without a full calculation.\n1.  **Calculate the Classical Distance:** First, calculate the distance as if we could ignore relativity. This provides a baseline.\n    `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    This value corresponds to option **B**.\n2.  **Apply the Relativistic Principle:** The theory of time dilation states that a moving clock is observed to run slower than a stationary clock. This means that for 50 seconds to pass in the ejecta's frame, a *longer* time must have passed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt > 50 s`).\n3.  **Draw a Conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame `Δt` is greater than 50 seconds, the relativistic distance `d` **must be greater** than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Check the Options:**\n    *   **A) 3 060 000 km** (Greater than 3,000,000 km -> Plausible)\n    *   B) 3 000 000 km (The classical result -> Incorrect)\n    *   C) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km -> Incorrect)\n    *   D) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km -> Incorrect)\nThis sanity check is sufficient to determine that **A** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm the logical conclusion, we perform the precise relativistic calculation. The distance `d` is found by first calculating the dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame and multiplying by the velocity `v`. The combined formula is:\n`d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n`d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Final Decision**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options, it is closest to **A) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the result from our qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Relativity is Required:** The speed of `0.2c` is a clear signal that classical mechanics (`d = v*t`) will be wrong. The classical result (`3,000,000 km`) is often included as a distractor option, as it is here (Option B).\n2.  **Proper Time is Key:** The most common mistake in these problems is misidentifying the proper time. The given `50 s` is the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's measured by a clock in the same frame as the event (the clock is on the ejecta). It is not the time measured by the stationary observer in the Galaxy.\n3.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem is solved most directly using time dilation. We are given a time interval in the moving frame and asked for a distance in the stationary frame, which requires calculating the corresponding dilated time in the stationary frame.\n4.  **Direction of the Effect:** It is vital to remember that time *dilation* means the time measured by the stationary observer is *longer*. Consequently, the distance measured in the stationary frame (`d = v * Δt`) is *greater* than the classical distance (`v * Δt₀`). This understanding underpins the powerful sanity check.\n5.  **Agent Consensus:** The unanimous agreement of all 15 agents on the physics, formula, and numerical result provides the highest possible confidence in this solution. The variance in their final letter choice was simply an artifact of their test environments.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity. A thorough analysis of all 15 candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the underlying physical principles, the required formulas, and the final numerical result. The minor discrepancies in the letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the answers are simply an artifact of their individual systems processing the multiple-choice options in different orders; their core reasoning and conclusion on the correct *value* are unanimous.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem states the ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. Therefore, the ejecta's speed is `v/c = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, classical physics is insufficient. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key phenomenon at play is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. The given time of 50 seconds passes in this frame.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt'` or `Δt₀`):** The given time interval, `50 s`, is measured by a clock on the ejecta. As this is the time measured in the moving object's own frame, it is the \"proper time.\"\n\n3.  **Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**: This is a powerful technique that can often solve the problem without a full calculation.\n    *   First, calculate the non-relativistic (classical) distance as a baseline:\n        `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km.`\n        This value corresponds to option **D**.\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt' = 50 s`) measured in the moving frame. This is because, from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slow. Therefore, `Δt > 50 s`.\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the relativistic distance `d` **must be greater than** the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n    *   Let's check the original options with this logic:\n        A) 3 060 000 km (Greater than 3,000,000 km) -> **Plausible**\n        B) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km) -> **Incorrect**\n        C) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km) -> **Incorrect**\n        D) 3 000 000 km (The classical result itself) -> **Incorrect**\n    *   This logical sanity check is sufficient to determine that **A** is the only possible correct answer.\n\n4.  **Perform the Full Quantitative Calculation**: To confirm the sanity check, we perform the exact relativistic calculation. The distance `d` in the stationary frame is found by multiplying the velocity by the time measured in the stationary frame, `Δt`.\n    The formula relating the observer's time (`Δt`) to the proper time (`Δt'`) is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n    The distance formula becomes:\n    `d = v * Δt = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 `\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Compare and Conclude**: The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to option **A) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from our sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativity vs. Classical Physics:** The most important first step is to recognize that the speed (0.2c) is relativistic, making a classical calculation incorrect. The classical answer (3,000,000 km) is deliberately included as a distractor option (D).\n*   **Correctly Identifying Proper Time:** A common mistake in relativity problems is misidentifying the proper time. The proper time (`Δt'`) is *always* the time measured by a clock in the same reference frame as the event's duration (here, the clock on the ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem is solved by using time dilation because we are given a time interval in one frame and asked to calculate a distance in another. This requires finding the dilated time in the stationary frame. Length contraction would apply to a different type of question, such as measuring the length of a moving object.\n*   **The Power of the Sanity Check:** As shown in Step 3, understanding the *direction* of the relativistic effect (time gets longer for the observer, so the distance is greater) is an extremely powerful tool for solving the problem and for checking against calculation errors.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the 15 candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles, the required formulas, and the final numerical result. The variance in the letter choices (A, B, C, or D) among the answers is simply an artifact of the multiple-choice options being listed in a different order for each agent, not a disagreement on the correct value. The following is a definitive, consolidated step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves an object (the supernova ejecta) moving at a velocity `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. Therefore, the ejecta's velocity is `v/c = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. At such a significant fraction of `c`, the principles of classical mechanics are no longer sufficient. This problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key phenomenon is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The given time interval, `50 s`, is measured by a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta). This is known as the \"proper time\".\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Dilated Time (Δt):** The corresponding time interval as measured in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**\nThis logical approach, highlighted by nearly every candidate answer, can often find the correct solution without a full calculation.\n1.  **Calculate the classical distance:** First, calculate the distance as if we were ignoring relativity. `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This value is listed as option **A**.\n2.  **Apply the principle of time dilation:** The theory states that an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more quickly than it does for the moving object. Therefore, for 50 seconds (`Δt₀`) to pass for the ejecta, a *longer* period of time (`Δt`) must have passed in the Galaxy's frame. So, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  **Draw the logical conclusion:** The distance we are looking for is measured in the Galaxy's frame and is calculated as `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the resulting distance `d` **must be greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n4.  **Examine the options:**\n    *   A) 3 000 000 km (This is the incorrect classical result)\n    *   B) 2 880 000 km (Less than the classical result)\n    *   C) 2 940 000 km (Less than the classical result)\n    *   D) 3 060 000 km (**The only option greater than the classical result**)\n\nThis sanity check is sufficient to identify **D** as the only physically plausible answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm the logical conclusion, we perform the full relativistic calculation.\n1.  The formula for time dilation connects the dilated time (`Δt`) to the proper time (`Δt₀`) using the Lorentz factor (`γ`). The distance is `d = v × Δt`.\n2.  Combining these, the distance formula becomes: `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n3.  Plugging in the numbers:\n    *   The numerator `v * Δt₀` is the classical distance: `3,000,000 km`.\n    *   The denominator is `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n4.  Calculate the final distance:\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Compare and Conclude**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **D) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from our sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Relativity vs. Classical Physics:** The most important step is to recognize that `v = 0.2c` requires using special relativity. Using classical mechanics leads to the incorrect answer of `3,000,000 km` (Option A), a common distractor in such problems.\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** It is critical to identify the `50 s` as the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the moving object's own frame of reference. A common error is to confuse this with the time measured by the stationary observer (`Δt`).\n3.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem gives a proper time and asks for a distance in the stationary frame, making it a classic time dilation problem. We must calculate the *dilated time* (`Δt`) in the stationary frame and then find the distance. Applying the concept of length contraction here would be incorrect and more complex.\n4.  **Direction of the Effect:** The term \"time dilation\" means the time measured by the stationary observer is *longer* (`Δt > Δt₀`). Consequently, the distance measured in the stationary frame (`d = v × Δt`) is *greater* than the classical distance calculated using the proper time. This provides the basis for the powerful sanity check.\n5.  **Agent Consensus:** The unanimity of the 15 candidate answers on the physical reasoning, formula, and final numerical result (`≈3,062,000 km`) provides extremely high confidence in the solution.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity. A thorough analysis of the 15 candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles, the correct formula, and the final numerical result. The slight variation in the final letter choices is due to the options being listed in a different order for each agent, not a disagreement on the physics.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Core Physical Principle**\n\nThe problem involves an object (the supernova ejecta) moving at a very high velocity: `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. Therefore, the ejecta's velocity is `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. At such speeds, classical Newtonian mechanics is no longer accurate. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key concept is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**2. Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt'` or `Δt₀`):** The given time interval, `50 s`, is measured by a clock on the ejecta (in the moving frame). This is called the \"proper time.\"\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time interval for the same event as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**3. Qualitative Sanity Check (The Quickest Method)**\n\nBefore any complex math, we can use logic to find the answer.\n1.  First, calculate the distance as if we could ignore relativity (the classical answer):\n    `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n    This value corresponds to option **D**.\n2.  The principle of time dilation states that a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta) appears to run slower to an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy). This means that for 50 seconds to pass for the ejecta, a **longer time** must have passed in the Galaxy's frame. Therefore, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the actual relativistic distance `d` **must be greater than** the classical distance of `3,000,000 km`.\n4.  Looking at the options:\n    A) **3 060 000 km** (Greater than 3,000,000 km)\n    B) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km)\n    C) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km)\n    D) 3 000 000 km (The classical result itself)\nThis logical check alone is sufficient to conclude that **A** is the only possible answer.\n\n**4. Quantitative Calculation (For Confirmation)**\n\nTo verify the result from the sanity check, we perform the full calculation using the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n1.  The formula for the distance `d` in the stationary frame is `d = v × Δt`.\n2.  We find the dilated time `Δt` from the proper time `Δt'` using the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n3.  We can combine these into a single formula for distance:\n    `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n4.  Plugging in the values:\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(1 - (60,000 / 300,000)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options, it is closest to **A) 3 060 000 km**. This confirms the result from our logical sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Physics:** The most common mistake is to simply multiply velocity by time (`60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`), which is the non-relativistic answer. The high velocity is a clear signal that relativity is required.\n2.  **Proper Time:** It is essential to correctly identify the `50 s` interval as the \"proper time\" (`Δt'`) because it is measured by a clock in the moving frame. Misidentifying this is a frequent error.\n3.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The question gives a proper time and asks for the distance in the stationary frame. The correct approach is to find the dilated time in the stationary frame and multiply it by the velocity. It is not a length contraction problem.\n4.  **Direction of the Effect:** Remember that time *dilation* means the time measured by the stationary observer is *longer*, which leads to a *greater* calculated distance in the stationary frame compared to the classical case. This is the key to the sanity check.\n5.  **Unanimous Agent Agreement:** All 15 candidate answers agreed on the physical principles and the final numerical result (`≈3,062,000 km`), providing the highest level of confidence in the solution.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the 15 candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the correct formula, the numerical calculation, and the final result. The only discrepancy among the answers is the letter choice (A, B, C, or D), which is an artifact of the multiple-choice options being listed in a different order for each agent. The underlying analysis is identical and sound in all cases.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves a supernova ejecta moving at `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's velocity is therefore `v/c = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this velocity is a significant fraction of `c`, the principles of classical mechanics are insufficient. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the specific phenomenon required is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The given time interval, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest relative to the event being timed.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative Sanity Check (The most intuitive approach)**\nBefore performing the full calculation, a logical check can quickly determine the correct answer.\n1.  **Calculate the Classical Distance:** First, find the distance if we ignored relativistic effects:\n    `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    This classical result corresponds to **Option A**.\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:** Time dilation states that a clock moving relative to an observer is measured to tick slower. This means that while 50 seconds (`Δt₀`) pass on the ejecta's clock, an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame will measure a *longer* period of time (`Δt`).\n3.  **Draw the Logical Conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and we know that `Δt > 50 s`, the resulting relativistic distance `d` **must be greater than** the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Examine the Options:**\n    *   A) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect - this is the classical result)\n    *   B) 3 060 000 km (**Plausible** - greater than the classical result)\n    *   C) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect - less than the classical result)\n    *   D) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect - less than the classical result)\nThis sanity check alone is sufficient to conclude that **B** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation (for Verification)**\nTo confirm our logical conclusion, we perform the precise calculation. The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is `d = v × Δt`. The dilated time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n\nThe complete formula for the distance is:\n`d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n1.  Plug in the values:\n    *   `v × Δt₀` (the numerator) is the classical distance: `3,000,000 km`.\n    *   `v²/c²` is `(0.2)² = 0.04`.\n2.  Calculate the distance:\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.04)`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Final Decision**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options, it is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the result from our qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Relativity vs. Classical Physics:** The most important first step is to recognize that the speed (`v = 0.2c`) is relativistic. The classical answer (`3,000,000 km`) is intentionally included as a distractor (Option A).\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** A common error is misidentifying the proper time. The given `50 s` is the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's the duration measured by the clock on the moving ejecta. The time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is always longer.\n3.  **The Power of the Sanity Check:** As shown in Step 3, understanding the *direction* of the relativistic effect is a powerful tool. Because of time dilation, the measured time in the stationary frame is *longer*, which leads to a *greater* distance traveled. This logic alone solves the problem.\n4.  **Time Dilation, Not Length Contraction:** The problem gives a time interval and asks for a distance, making it a classic time dilation problem. Length contraction would be relevant if the problem specified a proper length and asked for its observed length when in motion.\n5.  **Unanimous Consensus:** The fact that all 15 candidate agents, working independently, arrived at the same physical reasoning and numerical answer provides extremely high confidence in the solution.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the 15 candidate answers shows a complete consensus on the physical principles, the required formula, and the final numerical result. The minor discrepancies in the letter choices (A, B, C, D) are clearly artifacts of the agents' internal systems processing the options in different orders and do not reflect any disagreement on the correct value. The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis that consolidates the unanimous reasoning of the candidates.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Core Physical Principle:**\nThe supernova ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light is `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of `c`. Because this speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, the principles of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity must be used, not classical mechanics. The key phenomenon at play is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**2. Define Frames of Reference and Variables:**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The time given, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time\" because it is the time interval measured by a clock at rest relative to the events it is timing.\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The corresponding time interval as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**3. Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\":**\nThis is a highly effective method used by all the candidates to quickly find the correct answer through logic.\n1.  **Classical Calculation:** First, calculate the distance as if relativity did not apply:\n    `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option **D**.\n2.  **Relativistic Effect:** The principle of time dilation states that a moving clock is observed to run slower than a stationary clock. This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, a *longer* time interval (`Δt > 50s`) must have passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n3.  **Logical Conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since the velocity `v` is constant and the time `Δt` is greater than 50 seconds, the resulting distance `d` **must be greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n4.  **Review the Options:**\n    *   A) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n    *   B) 3 060 000 km (**Correct**, this is the only option greater than the classical distance)\n    *   C) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n    *   D) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect, this is the classical distance)\nThis logical check alone is sufficient to determine the correct answer.\n\n**4. Perform the Quantitative Calculation:**\nTo confirm the sanity check, we perform the full relativistic calculation. The distance `d` is found by combining the distance formula (`d = v × Δt`) with the time dilation formula (`Δt = γ × Δt₀`).\n*   The combined formula is: `d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n*   Plugging in the values:\n    `d = (60,000 km/s × 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Conclude:**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Recognizing the Need for Relativity:** The most common mistake in such problems is to perform a classical calculation (`distance = velocity × time`), which gives the incorrect answer of `3,000,000 km`, a value that is intentionally included as a distractor option.\n2.  **Correctly Identifying Proper Time:** It is absolutely critical to identify the given time `50 s` as the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the rest frame of the object in motion. Confusing proper time with dilated time is a frequent error.\n3.  **Applying the Correct Relativistic Effect:** This problem is about the passage of time being different between frames, directly involving time dilation. One should not confuse it with length contraction, which concerns the measured length of a moving object as seen by a stationary observer.\n4.  **The Power of the Sanity Check:** As demonstrated, understanding the *direction* of the relativistic effect is a powerful tool. Knowing that dilated time is always longer than proper time immediately tells you the relativistic distance must be greater than the classical one, often allowing you to solve the problem without a calculator and providing a check against calculation errors.\n5.  **Agent Consensus:** The fact that all 15 agents, despite potential differences in their internal models, arrived at the same physical reasoning and numerical result (`≈3,062,000 km`) provides extremely high confidence in the final answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a comprehensive review of all candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the correct physical principles, mathematical formulas, and the final numerical result. The minor discrepancies in the letter choices among the candidate answers are artifacts of how the multiple-choice options were ordered in their respective environments and do not reflect any disagreement on the physics.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe problem states that the supernova ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light is `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this speed is a significant fraction of `c`, the laws of classical mechanics are not accurate. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key phenomenon involved is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The reference frame of the Galaxy. The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The reference frame of the ejecta.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt'` or `Δt₀`):** The given time interval, `50 s`, is measured by a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time,\" as it's the time measured by a clock at rest relative to the events it is timing.\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** This is the corresponding time interval as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**\nThis is a powerful method for solving many relativity problems with logic, as highlighted by nearly all candidate answers.\n1.  **Calculate the Classical Distance:** First, find the distance if we were to incorrectly ignore relativistic effects:\n    `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to **Option A**.\n2.  **Apply the Time Dilation Principle:** The theory of time dilation states that a moving clock appears to run slower from the perspective of a stationary observer. This means that for 50 seconds (`Δt'`) to pass for the ejecta, a **longer** time interval (`Δt`) must have passed in the Galaxy's frame. So, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  **Draw the Logical Conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the actual distance `d` **must be greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n4.  **Review the Options:**\n    *   A) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect, this is the classical value)\n    *   B) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical value)\n    *   C) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical value)\n    *   D) 3 060 000 km (**Correct**, this is the only option greater than the classical value)\n\nThis sanity check alone is sufficient to confidently identify the correct answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm the logical result, we perform the full relativistic calculation.\n1.  The distance in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`.\n2.  We find the dilated time `Δt` using the proper time `Δt'` and the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n3.  Combining these formulas gives a single expression for the distance:\n    `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n4.  Plugging in the given values:\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.979796 `\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Compare and Finalize**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options, it is closest to **3,060,000 km**. This confirms the result from the sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Relativity vs. Classical Physics:** The most important initial step is to recognize that the speed (`v = 0.2c`) is relativistic, making the classical calculation (`d = v × t`) incorrect. The classical answer is often included as a distractor option.\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** Correctly identifying the given `50 s` as the **proper time** (`Δt'`) is critical. Proper time is the time interval measured in the frame where the clock is at rest. Misidentifying this is a common error in relativity problems.\n3.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem is solved by using time dilation. We are given a time interval in one frame and need to calculate a distance traveled in another. This requires finding the dilated time in the observer's frame (`Δt`) and then using `d = v × Δt`. Length contraction is a different phenomenon concerning the observed length of a moving object.\n4.  **The Power of the \"Sanity Check\":** For multiple-choice questions, understanding the *direction* of the relativistic effect is extremely useful. Knowing that dilated time is always longer than proper time immediately tells you that the distance measured in the stationary frame must be greater than the classical distance `v × Δt'`. This helps to quickly eliminate wrong answers and validate the final calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity. A thorough analysis of the provided answers shows a complete consensus on the physics, the required formula, and the final numerical result. The slight variations in the lettered choices (A, B, C, D) are artifacts of how the options were presented to each agent and do not reflect any disagreement on the correct value.\n\nHere is a definitive, consolidated step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this speed is a significant fraction of `c`, classical mechanics is not accurate. We must use Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key principle for this problem is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The given time interval, `50 s`, is measured by a clock on the ejecta. Since it is measured in the rest frame of the event's duration, it is the \"proper time\".\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time that elapses in the Galaxy's frame, which will be longer than the proper time.\n*   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** 60,000 km/s.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative Sanity Check**\nThis is a powerful way to solve the problem using logic alone.\n1.  **Classical Calculation:** First, calculate the distance as if we could ignore relativity. This gives a baseline for comparison.\n    `d_classical = v × Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n    (This corresponds to option B in the original problem statement).\n2.  **Relativistic Effect:** According to time dilation, a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta) is observed to run slower than a clock in the stationary frame (the Galaxy). This means that for 50 seconds to pass for the ejecta, a **longer time** must have passed in the Galaxy's frame. Therefore, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  **Logical Conclusion:** The distance we are looking for is the one measured in the Galaxy's frame, which is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the relativistic distance `d` **must be greater** than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Examine the Options:**\n    A) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km -> Incorrect)\n    B) 3 000 000 km (The classical result -> Incorrect)\n    C) 3 060 000 km (**Greater than 3,000,000 km -> Plausible**)\n    D) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km -> Incorrect)\n\nThis logical check is sufficient to identify the correct answer without further calculation.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm our reasoning, we perform the full relativistic calculation.\nThe distance `d` is given by the formula: `d = v * Δt`. We first need the dilated time `Δt`, which is given by `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\nWe can combine these formulas:\n`d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n*   The numerator `(v * Δt₀)` is the classical distance: `3,000,000 km`.\n*   The denominator is the relativistic correction: `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n*   `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n*   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, the value is closest to **3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from our qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Recognize the Need for Relativity:** The most important first step is realizing that `v = 0.2c` is a relativistic speed, making the classical answer of 3,000,000 km (Option B) incorrect, even though it's provided as a tempting distractor.\n*   **Correctly Identify Proper Time:** A common mistake in these problems is confusing which time is which. The \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) is always the time measured by a clock in the same frame as the event's duration (here, the clock is on the ejecta). The time given, `50 s`, is the proper time.\n*   **The Power of the Sanity Check:** In many multiple-choice relativity questions, calculating the classical answer first and then using the direction of the relativistic effect (time *dilation* means the observer's time is *longer*, so distance is *greater*) is sufficient to eliminate all incorrect options and find the solution.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem is solved by finding the time that passes in the observer's (Galaxy's) frame and multiplying it by the velocity. It is a time dilation problem. Applying length contraction would be inappropriate for this specific question setup.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity. An analysis of all the candidate answers shows a unanimous consensus on the physics, the required formula, and the final numerical result. The only discrepancy is the lettered choice, which is an artifact of the options being presented in a different order.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves an object (the supernova ejecta) moving at `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's velocity is `v/c = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. At such a high velocity, the effects described by Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity are significant, and classical physics is no longer accurate. The key principle here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The time given, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time.\"\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time interval for the same event as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**\nThis crucial step can often solve the problem without complex calculation.\n1.  First, calculate the non-relativistic (classical) distance, which would be `distance = velocity × time`.\n    `Classical Distance = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    This corresponds to option **B**.\n2.  The principle of time dilation states that from a stationary observer's perspective (the Galaxy), a moving clock (the ejecta's clock) runs slower. This means that for 50 seconds to pass in the ejecta's frame, a *longer* time must have passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n3.  Since the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = velocity × (time in Galaxy's frame)`, and the time in the Galaxy's frame is *greater than 50 seconds*, the resulting distance must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n4.  Looking at the options:\n    *   A) 2 880 000 km (less than 3,000,000 km)\n    *   B) 3 000 000 km (the incorrect classical answer)\n    *   C) 3 060 000 km (**greater than 3,000,000 km**)\n    *   D) 2 940 000 km (less than 3,000,000 km)\n5.  This logical check alone is sufficient to conclude that **C** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm the logical conclusion, we perform the full relativistic calculation. The formula that combines the distance calculation with time dilation is:\n`d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nThe code execution provided the precise result for this calculation: `3,061,862.178... km`.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude by Comparing with Options**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options from the original question:\n*   A) 2 880 000 km\n*   B) 3 000 000 km\n*   C) 3 060 000 km\n*   D) 2 940 000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Proper Time vs. Dilated Time**: It is essential to correctly identify the given `50 s` as the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the moving object's frame. The distance is asked for in the stationary frame, which experiences dilated time (`Δt`).\n2.  **Relativity Increases the Result**: Time dilation leads to a *longer* time measurement in the stationary frame, thus a *longer* distance compared to a classical calculation. Any answer smaller than the classical result is immediately incorrect.\n3.  **Classical Answer as a Distractor**: Multiple-choice questions in relativity often include the classical result (`3,000,000 km`) as a distractor option (option B).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the correct formula, and the final numerical result.

Here is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem states the ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. This speed is 20% of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`). Because this velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light, the principles of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity must be used, not classical physics. The key phenomenon at play here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame. The time elapsed in this frame is the dilated time, `Δt`.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. The given time of 50 seconds passes in this frame. This is the **proper time (`Δt₀`)**.\n    *   **Given values:** `v = 60,000 km/s`, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n3.  **Qualitative Analysis (The \"Sanity Check\" Method)**: Before performing complex calculations, a logical check can often identify the correct answer. This method was successfully used by all the analyzed agents.\n    *   **Classical Calculation**: First, calculate the distance if we were to ignore relativistic effects:\n        `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n        This corresponds to option **D**.\n    *   **Relativistic Effect**: The theory of time dilation states that a moving clock (on the ejecta) runs slower from the perspective of a stationary observer (in the Galaxy). This means that for 50 seconds (`Δt₀`) to pass in the ejecta's frame, a *longer* time interval (`Δt`) must pass in the Galaxy's frame. Therefore, `Δt > 50 s`.\n    *   **Logical Conclusion**: The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50s`, the distance `d` *must* be greater than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n    *   **Reviewing the Options**:\n        A) 2 880 000 km. (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n        B) 2 940 000 km. (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n        C) 3 060 000 km. (**Correct**, this is the only option greater than the classical distance)\n        D) 3 000 000 km. (Incorrect, this is the classical distance)\n    This logical check alone is sufficient to determine the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Quantitative Calculation (for Confirmation)**: To confirm the sanity check, we perform the full relativistic calculation.\n    *   The distance in the stationary (Galaxy) frame is `d = v × Δt`.\n    *   The dilated time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor (`γ`): `Δt = γ × Δt₀`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor `γ` is defined as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining these gives the direct formula for the distance: `d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Plugging in the known values:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s × 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 `\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Final Decision**: The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, the value is closest to **C) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from the qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Recognizing the Need for Relativity:** The most common mistake in such problems is to perform a classical calculation (`d=v*t`), which yields `3,000,000 km`. The speed being 20% that of light (`0.2c`) is a clear signal that relativity is required.\n*   **Correctly Identifying Proper Time:** It is absolutely critical to identify the given `50 s` as the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the object's own moving reference frame. Confusing proper time with observer time is a frequent error.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem is solved using time dilation because it provides a time interval in one frame and asks for a distance in another, which is a function of that frame's time. We find the time as measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) and then use `d = v × Δt`. Length contraction is a different, though related, effect concerning an object's measured dimensions.\n*   **The Direction of the Effect:** Time *dilation* means the time measured by the stationary observer is *longer* than the proper time. Consequently, the distance measured by the stationary observer (`d = v × Δt`) is *greater* than the classical distance calculated using proper time (`v × Δt₀`). This simple rule provides the powerful basis for the sanity check.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong and unanimous consensus on the physics principles, the required formula, and the final numerical result. The variation in the final letter choices (e.g., A, B, C, D) among the answers is simply an artifact of their individual systems processing the multiple-choice options in different orders; their underlying analysis and conclusion about the correct *value* are identical.\n\nHere is a definitive, consolidated step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe supernova ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light `c` is approximately `300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's velocity is `v/c = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, classical physics (d = v*t) is not accurate. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key principle is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from this frame (`d`).\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt'` or `Δt₀`):** The time measured in the moving frame, given as `50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest relative to the events it is timing (i.e., a clock on the ejecta).\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time interval that passes in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**\nThis logical step, employed by all the candidate answers, can often solve the problem without requiring a calculator.\n1.  **Calculate the classical distance:** First, find the distance ignoring relativity, which provides a baseline.\n    `d_classical = v × Δt' = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to **Option C** in the question.\n2.  **Apply the principle of time dilation:** Time dilation states that a moving clock (on the ejecta) appears to run slower from the perspective of a stationary observer (in the Galaxy). This means that for 50 seconds to pass on the ejecta's clock, a **longer** period of time must have passed in the Galaxy's frame. So, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  **Draw a conclusion:** The distance we need to find is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the actual distance `d` **must be greater than** the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Review the options:**\n    *   A) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km -> Incorrect)\n    *   B) 3 060 000 km (**Greater than 3,000,000 km -> Plausible**)\n    *   C) 3 000 000 km (The classical result itself -> Incorrect)\n    *   D) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km -> Incorrect)\nThis sanity check is sufficient to determine that **B** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm the logical conclusion, we perform the full relativistic calculation. The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is `d = v × Δt`. First, we find the dilated time `Δt` from the proper time `Δt'` using the Lorentz factor `γ`.\nThe combined formula is: `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n`d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96) `\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Compare and Conclude**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options provided, it is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from our sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Physics:** The most crucial first step is to recognize that the speed (0.2c) necessitates the use of special relativity. Using classical physics yields 3,000,000 km, which is incorrect but is typically offered as a distractor option (Option C).\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** A very common mistake in relativity problems is misidentifying the proper time. The proper time (`Δt'`) is always the time measured in the frame that is at rest relative to the event being timed—in this case, the `50 s` measured by a clock on the ejecta.\n3.  **Time Dilation Implication:** Remember that time *dilation* means the time measured in the stationary frame is *longer*. Consequently, the distance calculated using this dilated time will be *greater* than the classical distance. Any answer smaller than the classical one is immediately wrong.\n4.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem is solved most directly using time dilation, as we are given a time interval in the moving frame and asked for a distance in the stationary frame. This requires calculating the corresponding time (`Δt`) in the stationary frame.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong and unanimous consensus on the physics, the correct formula, and the final numerical result. The variance in the letter choices (A, B, C, or D) across the different answers is an artifact of the agents processing randomized lists of options, not a disagreement on the correct value. The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis based on their collective reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem states the ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. This is 20% of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`). At such a high speed, classical physics is not sufficient. The problem involves comparing time and distance between two different inertial reference frames (the Galaxy and the ejecta), so it must be solved using **Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity**. The key phenomenon here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The given time, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time.\"\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time interval for the same event as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**\nThis logical step is extremely powerful and can often solve the problem without a full calculation.\n1.  **Calculate the classical distance:** First, calculate the distance if we ignored relativistic effects:\n    `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km.`\n    This corresponds to option **B**.\n2.  **Apply the relativistic principle:** The theory of time dilation states that a clock in the moving frame (ejecta) is observed to run slower than a clock in the stationary frame (Galaxy). This means that for 50 seconds to pass for the ejecta, a **longer** time (`Δt > 50 s`) must pass in the Galaxy's frame.\n3.  **Draw the logical conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the relativistic distance `d` **must be greater** than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Review the options:**\n    A) 3 060 000 km (**Plausible** - greater than 3,000,000 km)\n    B) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect - this is the classical result)\n    C) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect - less than the classical result)\n    D) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect - less than the classical result)\nThis sanity check is sufficient to determine that **A** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm our logical conclusion, we perform the precise calculation. The distance `d` is found using the dilated time `Δt`. The relationship is:\n`d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n*   The numerator `(v × Δt₀)` is the classical distance: `3,000,000 km`.\n*   The denominator corrects for relativity:\n    `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`\n*   Now, calculate the final distance:\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.979796...`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to option **A) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the result from the sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Physics:** The most common mistake is to perform a simple classical calculation (`d=v*t`), which yields `3,000,000 km`. This answer is included as a distractor (Option B). The speed being 20% of `c` is a clear signal that relativity is mandatory.\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** It is critical to identify the given `50 s` as the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the moving object's own reference frame. Misidentifying this as the observer's time (`Δt`) would lead to an incorrect calculation.\n3.  **Time Dilation, Not Length Contraction:** The problem gives a time in the moving frame and asks for a distance in the stationary frame. The direct approach is to calculate the time that passed in the stationary frame (the dilated time) and use that to find the distance. This is a time dilation problem.\n4.  **The Power of the Sanity Check:** For many multiple-choice relativity problems, understanding the *direction* of the effect is sufficient. Knowing that the time for the observer is longer, and therefore the distance measured by the observer is greater, is a powerful tool to eliminate incorrect answers and guard against calculation errors.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a problem concerning Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.

This is the \"proper time.\"\n\n3.  **Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**: This is a powerful logical approach that can often solve relativity problems without a full calculation.\n    *   First, calculate the non-relativistic (classical) distance as a baseline:\n        `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n        This value is present as option D.\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt₀ = 50 s`) measured in the moving frame. This is because, from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock runs slow. Therefore, `Δt > 50 s`.\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the relativistic distance `d` **must be greater than** the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n    *   Examining the options:\n        *   A) 3,060,000 km (**Plausible**, greater than 3,000,000 km)\n        *   B) 2,880,000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n        *   C) 2,940,000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n        *   D) 3,000,000 km (Incorrect, this is the classical result)\n    *   This logical check is sufficient to determine that **A** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n4.  **Perform the Quantitative Calculation**: To confirm the logical sanity check, we perform the exact relativistic calculation. The distance `d` is given by `d = v × Δt`, where `Δt` is the dilated time. The formula relating dilated time to proper time is `Δt = Δt₀ / √(1 - v²/c²)`. Combining these gives:\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    I will use a code block to calculate this precisely.\n    ```python\n    import math\n    \n    v = 60000  # km/s\n    t0 = 50     # s\n    c = 299792.458 # km/s, using the precise value\n    \n    # Calculate the classical distance\n    d_classical = v * t0\n    \n    # Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n    gamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v**2 / c**2))\n    \n    # Calculate the relativistic distance\n    d_relativistic = gamma * d_classical\n    \n    print(f\"Classical distance: {d_classical} km\")\n    print(f\"Relativistic distance: {d_relativistic} km\")\n    \n    # For calculation based on c = 300,000 km/s\n    c_approx = 300000\n    gamma_approx = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v**2 / c_approx**2))\n    d_relativistic_approx = gamma_approx * d_classical\n    print(f\"Relativistic distance (using c=300000): {d_relativistic_approx} km\")\n    ```\n    \n    <execute_code>\n    execution_outputs:\n    Classical distance: 3000000 km\n    Relativistic distance: 3061224.489795918 km\n    Relativistic distance (using c=300000): 3061862.178478471 km\n    </execute_code>\n    \n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculation shows the relativistic distance is approximately `3,061,862 km` (using the common approximation of c=300,000 km/s). This value is extremely close to option **A) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from the qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Relativity vs. Classical Physics**: The most critical first step is to recognize that the speed (`v = 0.2c`) is relativistic, making a classical calculation incorrect. The classical answer (`3,000,000 km`) is deliberately included as a distractor (Option D).\n*   **Proper Time Identification**: A common mistake in relativity problems is misidentifying the proper time. The proper time (`Δt₀`) is *always* the time measured by a clock in the same reference frame as the event's duration—here, the `50 s` measured by the clock on the ejecta.\n*   **Direction of the Effect (Time Dilation)**: It is vital to understand that time *dilation* means the time measured by the stationary observer is *longer*. Consequently, the distance measured in the stationary frame (`d = v × Δt`) is *greater* than the classical distance calculated using the proper time. This simple logic provides the powerful basis for the \"sanity check.\"\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction**: The problem is correctly solved by using time dilation because we are given a time interval in one frame and need to calculate a distance in another, which is a function of that frame's time. This is distinct from length contraction, which relates to the measured length of a moving object.\n*   **Unanimous Consensus**: The fact that all 15 independent agents arrived at the same physical reasoning, formula, and final numerical result provides extremely high confidence in the solution.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The slight variation in the letter choices among the candidate answers is an artifact of their systems processing the options in different orders; their underlying analysis and numerical conclusion are identical and correct.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem involves a supernova ejecta moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. This speed is 20% of the speed of light (`c` ≈ 300,000 km/s), so `v = 0.2c`. At such high speeds, comparing measurements between different inertial frames (the ejecta and the Galaxy) requires the use of Special Relativity, not classical physics. The specific phenomenon at play is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The reference frame of the Galaxy. The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The reference frame of the ejecta.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`)**: The given time interval, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame of the ejecta. This is the \"proper time.\"\n    *   **Dilated Time (`Δt`)**: The time interval corresponding to the 50s of proper time, but as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n3.  **Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**: This logical approach can often solve the problem without requiring a full calculation.\n    *   **Calculate the Classical Distance**: First, calculate the distance if we were to ignore relativistic effects. This provides a baseline.\n        `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n        This value corresponds to option **D** in the problem statement.\n    *   **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation**: The theory of time dilation states that a moving clock is observed to run slower than a stationary clock. This means that while 50 seconds (`Δt₀`) pass for the ejecta, a *longer* time (`Δt`) must have passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   **Draw a Logical Conclusion**: The distance we need to find is the one measured in the Galaxy's frame, calculated as `d = v × Δt`. Since the velocity `v` is constant and the time `Δt` is greater than `50 s`, the resulting distance `d` **must be greater than** the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n    *   **Examine the Options**: Looking at the options provided in the question:\n        A) 3 060 000 km (**Greater** than 3,000,000 km)\n        B) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km)\n        C) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km)\n        D) 3 000 000 km (The classical result itself)\n    *   This sanity check alone is sufficient to identify **A** as the only physically possible answer.\n\n4.  **Perform the Quantitative Calculation for Confirmation**:\n    The distance in the stationary frame `d` is given by `d = v × Δt`. The dilated time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n    The combined formula is: `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    *   Plug in the known values:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s × 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 `\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**: The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **A) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from the qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativity vs. Classical Physics**: The most critical first step is recognizing that the speed (20% of light speed) is relativistic, making a classical calculation incorrect. The classical answer (`3,000,000 km`) is intentionally included as a distractor.\n*   **Correctly Identifying Proper Time**: A common pitfall in relativity problems is misidentifying the given time. The `50 s` interval is the **proper time** (`Δt₀`) because it is measured by a clock in the same frame as the event's duration (i.e., on the moving ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation Implication**: Time *dilation* means the time measured by the stationary observer is *longer*, which in turn means the distance measured (`d = v × Δt`) is *greater* than the classical distance. Understanding this directionality is key to the sanity check.\n*   **Time Dilation, Not Length Contraction**: The problem is correctly solved by using time dilation because we start with a time interval in one frame and need to calculate a distance in another. This involves finding the corresponding (dilated) time in the observer's frame. Length contraction is a different, though related, phenomenon.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a remarkable consensus. All 15 agents correctly identified the core physics, used the correct formula, and arrived at the same numerical result. The only discrepancy was the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D), which indicates that the options were presented to them in a different order. This universal agreement on the methodology and result provides very high confidence in the final answer.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis synthesized from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is therefore `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% the speed of light. Because this velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light, classical physics is not sufficient. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key phenomenon is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The given time, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time,\" as it is measured by a clock at rest relative to the events it is timing.\n*   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** `60,000 km/s`.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**\nThis logical analysis is a powerful tool used by almost all the agents and can often solve the problem without a full calculation.\n1.  **Calculate the Classical Distance:** First, calculate the distance as if we could ignore relativity. This provides a baseline.\n    `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    This value corresponds to option **B**.\n2.  **Apply the Relativistic Principle:** The theory of time dilation states that a moving clock is observed to run slower than a stationary clock. This means that for 50 seconds to pass in the ejecta's frame, a *longer* time must have passed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt > 50 s`).\n3.  **Draw a Conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame `Δt` is greater than 50 seconds, the relativistic distance `d` **must be greater** than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Check the Options:**\n    *   **A) 3 060 000 km** (Greater than 3,000,000 km -> Plausible)\n    *   B) 3 000 000 km (The classical result -> Incorrect)\n    *   C) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km -> Incorrect)\n    *   D) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km -> Incorrect)\nThis sanity check is sufficient to determine that **A** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm the logical conclusion, we perform the precise relativistic calculation. The distance `d` is found by first calculating the dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame and multiplying by the velocity `v`. The combined formula is:\n`d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n`d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Final Decision**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options, it is closest to **A) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the result from our qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Relativity is Required:** The speed of `0.2c` is a clear signal that classical mechanics (`d = v*t`) will be wrong. The classical result (`3,000,000 km`) is often included as a distractor option, as it is here (Option B).\n2.  **Proper Time is Key:** The most common mistake in these problems is misidentifying the proper time. The given `50 s` is the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's measured by a clock in the same frame as the event (the clock is on the ejecta). It is not the time measured by the stationary observer in the Galaxy.\n3.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem is solved most directly using time dilation. We are given a time interval in the moving frame and asked for a distance in the stationary frame, which requires calculating the corresponding dilated time in the stationary frame.\n4.  **Direction of the Effect:** It is vital to remember that time *dilation* means the time measured by the stationary observer is *longer*. Consequently, the distance measured in the stationary frame (`d = v * Δt`) is *greater* than the classical distance (`v * Δt₀`). This understanding underpins the powerful sanity check.\n5.  **Agent Consensus:** The unanimous agreement of all 15 agents on the physics, formula, and numerical result provides the highest possible confidence in this solution. The variance in their final letter choice was simply an artifact of their test environments.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity. A thorough analysis of all 15 candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the underlying physical principles, the required formulas, and the final numerical result. The minor discrepancies in the letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the answers are simply an artifact of their individual systems processing the multiple-choice options in different orders; their core reasoning and conclusion on the correct *value* are unanimous.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem states the ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. Therefore, the ejecta's speed is `v/c = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, classical physics is insufficient. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key phenomenon at play is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. The given time of 50 seconds passes in this frame.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt'` or `Δt₀`):** The given time interval, `50 s`, is measured by a clock on the ejecta. As this is the time measured in the moving object's own frame, it is the \"proper time.\"\n\n3.  **Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**: This is a powerful technique that can often solve the problem without a full calculation.\n    *   First, calculate the non-relativistic (classical) distance as a baseline:\n        `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km.`\n        This value corresponds to option **D**.\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt' = 50 s`) measured in the moving frame. This is because, from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slow. Therefore, `Δt > 50 s`.\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the relativistic distance `d` **must be greater than** the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n    *   Let's check the original options with this logic:\n        A) 3 060 000 km (Greater than 3,000,000 km) -> **Plausible**\n        B) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km) -> **Incorrect**\n        C) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km) -> **Incorrect**\n        D) 3 000 000 km (The classical result itself) -> **Incorrect**\n    *   This logical sanity check is sufficient to determine that **A** is the only possible correct answer.\n\n4.  **Perform the Full Quantitative Calculation**: To confirm the sanity check, we perform the exact relativistic calculation. The distance `d` in the stationary frame is found by multiplying the velocity by the time measured in the stationary frame, `Δt`.\n    The formula relating the observer's time (`Δt`) to the proper time (`Δt'`) is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n    The distance formula becomes:\n    `d = v * Δt = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 `\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Compare and Conclude**: The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to option **A) 3,060,000 km**.

This requires finding the dilated time in the stationary frame. Length contraction would apply to a different type of question, such as measuring the length of a moving object.\n*   **The Power of the Sanity Check:** As shown in Step 3, understanding the *direction* of the relativistic effect (time gets longer for the observer, so the distance is greater) is an extremely powerful tool for solving the problem and for checking against calculation errors.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the 15 candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles, the required formulas, and the final numerical result. The variance in the letter choices (A, B, C, or D) among the answers is simply an artifact of the multiple-choice options being listed in a different order for each agent, not a disagreement on the correct value. The following is a definitive, consolidated step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves an object (the supernova ejecta) moving at a velocity `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. Therefore, the ejecta's velocity is `v/c = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. At such a significant fraction of `c`, the principles of classical mechanics are no longer sufficient. This problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key phenomenon is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The given time interval, `50 s`, is measured by a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta). This is known as the \"proper time\".\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Dilated Time (Δt):** The corresponding time interval as measured in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**\nThis logical approach, highlighted by nearly every candidate answer, can often find the correct solution without a full calculation.\n1.  **Calculate the classical distance:** First, calculate the distance as if we were ignoring relativity. `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This value is listed as option **A**.\n2.  **Apply the principle of time dilation:** The theory states that an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more quickly than it does for the moving object. Therefore, for 50 seconds (`Δt₀`) to pass for the ejecta, a *longer* period of time (`Δt`) must have passed in the Galaxy's frame. So, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  **Draw the logical conclusion:** The distance we are looking for is measured in the Galaxy's frame and is calculated as `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the resulting distance `d` **must be greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n4.  **Examine the options:**\n    *   A) 3 000 000 km (This is the incorrect classical result)\n    *   B) 2 880 000 km (Less than the classical result)\n    *   C) 2 940 000 km (Less than the classical result)\n    *   D) 3 060 000 km (**The only option greater than the classical result**)\n\nThis sanity check is sufficient to identify **D** as the only physically plausible answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm the logical conclusion, we perform the full relativistic calculation.\n1.  The formula for time dilation connects the dilated time (`Δt`) to the proper time (`Δt₀`) using the Lorentz factor (`γ`). The distance is `d = v × Δt`.\n2.  Combining these, the distance formula becomes: `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n3.  Plugging in the numbers:\n    *   The numerator `v * Δt₀` is the classical distance: `3,000,000 km`.\n    *   The denominator is `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n4.  Calculate the final distance:\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Compare and Conclude**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **D) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from our sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Relativity vs. Classical Physics:** The most important step is to recognize that `v = 0.2c` requires using special relativity. Using classical mechanics leads to the incorrect answer of `3,000,000 km` (Option A), a common distractor in such problems.\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** It is critical to identify the `50 s` as the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the moving object's own frame of reference. A common error is to confuse this with the time measured by the stationary observer (`Δt`).\n3.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem gives a proper time and asks for a distance in the stationary frame, making it a classic time dilation problem. We must calculate the *dilated time* (`Δt`) in the stationary frame and then find the distance. Applying the concept of length contraction here would be incorrect and more complex.\n4.  **Direction of the Effect:** The term \"time dilation\" means the time measured by the stationary observer is *longer* (`Δt > Δt₀`). Consequently, the distance measured in the stationary frame (`d = v × Δt`) is *greater* than the classical distance calculated using the proper time. This provides the basis for the powerful sanity check.\n5.  **Agent Consensus:** The unanimity of the 15 candidate answers on the physical reasoning, formula, and final numerical result (`≈3,062,000 km`) provides extremely high confidence in the solution.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity. A thorough analysis of the 15 candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles, the correct formula, and the final numerical result. The slight variation in the final letter choices is due to the options being listed in a different order for each agent, not a disagreement on the physics.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Core Physical Principle**\n\nThe problem involves an object (the supernova ejecta) moving at a very high velocity: `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. Therefore, the ejecta's velocity is `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. At such speeds, classical Newtonian mechanics is no longer accurate. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key concept is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**2. Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt'` or `Δt₀`):** The given time interval, `50 s`, is measured by a clock on the ejecta (in the moving frame). This is called the \"proper time.\"\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time interval for the same event as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**3. Qualitative Sanity Check (The Quickest Method)**\n\nBefore any complex math, we can use logic to find the answer.\n1.  First, calculate the distance as if we could ignore relativity (the classical answer):\n    `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n    This value corresponds to option **D**.\n2.  The principle of time dilation states that a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta) appears to run slower to an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy). This means that for 50 seconds to pass for the ejecta, a **longer time** must have passed in the Galaxy's frame. Therefore, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the actual relativistic distance `d` **must be greater than** the classical distance of `3,000,000 km`.\n4.  Looking at the options:\n    A) **3 060 000 km** (Greater than 3,000,000 km)\n    B) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km)\n    C) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km)\n    D) 3 000 000 km (The classical result itself)\nThis logical check alone is sufficient to conclude that **A** is the only possible answer.\n\n**4. Quantitative Calculation (For Confirmation)**\n\nTo verify the result from the sanity check, we perform the full calculation using the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n1.  The formula for the distance `d` in the stationary frame is `d = v × Δt`.\n2.  We find the dilated time `Δt` from the proper time `Δt'` using the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n3.  We can combine these into a single formula for distance:\n    `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n4.  Plugging in the values:\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(1 - (60,000 / 300,000)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options, it is closest to **A) 3 060 000 km**. This confirms the result from our logical sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Physics:** The most common mistake is to simply multiply velocity by time (`60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`), which is the non-relativistic answer. The high velocity is a clear signal that relativity is required.\n2.  **Proper Time:** It is essential to correctly identify the `50 s` interval as the \"proper time\" (`Δt'`) because it is measured by a clock in the moving frame. Misidentifying this is a frequent error.\n3.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The question gives a proper time and asks for the distance in the stationary frame. The correct approach is to find the dilated time in the stationary frame and multiply it by the velocity. It is not a length contraction problem.\n4.  **Direction of the Effect:** Remember that time *dilation* means the time measured by the stationary observer is *longer*, which leads to a *greater* calculated distance in the stationary frame compared to the classical case. This is the key to the sanity check.\n5.  **Unanimous Agent Agreement:** All 15 candidate answers agreed on the physical principles and the final numerical result (`≈3,062,000 km`), providing the highest level of confidence in the solution.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the 15 candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the correct formula, the numerical calculation, and the final result. The only discrepancy among the answers is the letter choice (A, B, C, or D), which is an artifact of the multiple-choice options being listed in a different order for each agent. The underlying analysis is identical and sound in all cases.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves a supernova ejecta moving at `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's velocity is therefore `v/c = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this velocity is a significant fraction of `c`, the principles of classical mechanics are insufficient. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the specific phenomenon required is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The given time interval, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest relative to the event being timed.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative Sanity Check (The most intuitive approach)**\nBefore performing the full calculation, a logical check can quickly determine the correct answer.\n1.  **Calculate the Classical Distance:** First, find the distance if we ignored relativistic effects:\n    `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    This classical result corresponds to **Option A**.\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:** Time dilation states that a clock moving relative to an observer is measured to tick slower. This means that while 50 seconds (`Δt₀`) pass on the ejecta's clock, an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame will measure a *longer* period of time (`Δt`).\n3.  **Draw the Logical Conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and we know that `Δt > 50 s`, the resulting relativistic distance `d` **must be greater than** the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Examine the Options:**\n    *   A) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect - this is the classical result)\n    *   B) 3 060 000 km (**Plausible** - greater than the classical result)\n    *   C) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect - less than the classical result)\n    *   D) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect - less than the classical result)\nThis sanity check alone is sufficient to conclude that **B** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation (for Verification)**\nTo confirm our logical conclusion, we perform the precise calculation. The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is `d = v × Δt`. The dilated time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n\nThe complete formula for the distance is:\n`d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n1.  Plug in the values:\n    *   `v × Δt₀` (the numerator) is the classical distance: `3,000,000 km`.\n    *   `v²/c²` is `(0.2)² = 0.04`.\n2.  Calculate the distance:\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(1 - 0.04)`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Final Decision**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options, it is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the result from our qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Relativity vs. Classical Physics:** The most important first step is to recognize that the speed (`v = 0.2c`) is relativistic. The classical answer (`3,000,000 km`) is intentionally included as a distractor (Option A).\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** A common error is misidentifying the proper time. The given `50 s` is the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's the duration measured by the clock on the moving ejecta. The time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is always longer.\n3.  **The Power of the Sanity Check:** As shown in Step 3, understanding the *direction* of the relativistic effect is a powerful tool. Because of time dilation, the measured time in the stationary frame is *longer*, which leads to a *greater* distance traveled. This logic alone solves the problem.\n4.  **Time Dilation, Not Length Contraction:** The problem gives a time interval and asks for a distance, making it a classic time dilation problem. Length contraction would be relevant if the problem specified a proper length and asked for its observed length when in motion.\n5.  **Unanimous Consensus:** The fact that all 15 candidate agents, working independently, arrived at the same physical reasoning and numerical answer provides extremely high confidence in the solution.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the 15 candidate answers shows a complete consensus on the physical principles, the required formula, and the final numerical result. The minor discrepancies in the letter choices (A, B, C, D) are clearly artifacts of the agents' internal systems processing the options in different orders and do not reflect any disagreement on the correct value. The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis that consolidates the unanimous reasoning of the candidates.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Core Physical Principle:**\nThe supernova ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light is `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of `c`. Because this speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, the principles of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity must be used, not classical mechanics. The key phenomenon at play is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**2. Define Frames of Reference and Variables:**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The time given, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time\" because it is the time interval measured by a clock at rest relative to the events it is timing.\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The corresponding time interval as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**3. Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\":**\nThis is a highly effective method used by all the candidates to quickly find the correct answer through logic.\n1.  **Classical Calculation:** First, calculate the distance as if relativity did not apply:\n    `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option **D**.\n2.  **Relativistic Effect:** The principle of time dilation states that a moving clock is observed to run slower than a stationary clock. This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, a *longer* time interval (`Δt > 50s`) must have passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n3.  **Logical Conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since the velocity `v` is constant and the time `Δt` is greater than 50 seconds, the resulting distance `d` **must be greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n4.  **Review the Options:**\n    *   A) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n    *   B) 3 060 000 km (**Correct**, this is the only option greater than the classical distance)\n    *   C) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n    *   D) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect, this is the classical distance)\nThis logical check alone is sufficient to determine the correct answer.\n\n**4. Perform the Quantitative Calculation:**\nTo confirm the sanity check, we perform the full relativistic calculation. The distance `d` is found by combining the distance formula (`d = v × Δt`) with the time dilation formula (`Δt = γ × Δt₀`).\n*   The combined formula is: `d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n*   Plugging in the values:\n    `d = (60,000 km/s × 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Conclude:**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Recognizing the Need for Relativity:** The most common mistake in such problems is to perform a classical calculation (`distance = velocity × time`), which gives the incorrect answer of `3,000,000 km`, a value that is intentionally included as a distractor option.\n2.  **Correctly Identifying Proper Time:** It is absolutely critical to identify the given time `50 s` as the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the rest frame of the object in motion. Confusing proper time with dilated time is a frequent error.\n3.  **Applying the Correct Relativistic Effect:** This problem is about the passage of time being different between frames, directly involving time dilation. One should not confuse it with length contraction, which concerns the measured length of a moving object as seen by a stationary observer.\n4.  **The Power of the Sanity Check:** As demonstrated, understanding the *direction* of the relativistic effect is a powerful tool. Knowing that dilated time is always longer than proper time immediately tells you the relativistic distance must be greater than the classical one, often allowing you to solve the problem without a calculator and providing a check against calculation errors.\n5.  **Agent Consensus:** The fact that all 15 agents, despite potential differences in their internal models, arrived at the same physical reasoning and numerical result (`≈3,062,000 km`) provides extremely high confidence in the final answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a comprehensive review of all candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the correct physical principles, mathematical formulas, and the final numerical result. The minor discrepancies in the letter choices among the candidate answers are artifacts of how the multiple-choice options were ordered in their respective environments and do not reflect any disagreement on the physics.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe problem states that the supernova ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light is `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this speed is a significant fraction of `c`, the laws of classical mechanics are not accurate. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key phenomenon involved is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The reference frame of the Galaxy.

This is the \"proper time,\" as it's the time measured by a clock at rest relative to the events it is timing.\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** This is the corresponding time interval as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**\nThis is a powerful method for solving many relativity problems with logic, as highlighted by nearly all candidate answers.\n1.  **Calculate the Classical Distance:** First, find the distance if we were to incorrectly ignore relativistic effects:\n    `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to **Option A**.\n2.  **Apply the Time Dilation Principle:** The theory of time dilation states that a moving clock appears to run slower from the perspective of a stationary observer. This means that for 50 seconds (`Δt'`) to pass for the ejecta, a **longer** time interval (`Δt`) must have passed in the Galaxy's frame. So, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  **Draw the Logical Conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`.

The distance in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`.\n2.  We find the dilated time `Δt` using the proper time `Δt'` and the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n3.  Combining these formulas gives a single expression for the distance:\n    `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n4.  Plugging in the given values:\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.979796 `\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Compare and Finalize**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options, it is closest to **3,060,000 km**. This confirms the result from the sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Relativity vs. Classical Physics:** The most important initial step is to recognize that the speed (`v = 0.2c`) is relativistic, making the classical calculation (`d = v × t`) incorrect. The classical answer is often included as a distractor option.\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** Correctly identifying the given `50 s` as the **proper time** (`Δt'`) is critical. Proper time is the time interval measured in the frame where the clock is at rest. Misidentifying this is a common error in relativity problems.\n3.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem is solved by using time dilation. We are given a time interval in one frame and need to calculate a distance traveled in another. This requires finding the dilated time in the observer's frame (`Δt`) and then using `d = v × Δt`. Length contraction is a different phenomenon concerning the observed length of a moving object.\n4.  **The Power of the \"Sanity Check\":** For multiple-choice questions, understanding the *direction* of the relativistic effect is extremely useful. Knowing that dilated time is always longer than proper time immediately tells you that the distance measured in the stationary frame must be greater than the classical distance `v × Δt'`. This helps to quickly eliminate wrong answers and validate the final calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity.

The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this speed is a significant fraction of `c`, classical mechanics is not accurate. We must use Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key principle for this problem is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame.

This gives a baseline for comparison.\n    `d_classical = v × Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n    (This corresponds to option B in the original problem statement).\n2.  **Relativistic Effect:** According to time dilation, a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta) is observed to run slower than a clock in the stationary frame (the Galaxy). This means that for 50 seconds to pass for the ejecta, a **longer time** must have passed in the Galaxy's frame. Therefore, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  **Logical Conclusion:** The distance we are looking for is the one measured in the Galaxy's frame, which is `d = v × Δt`.

We first need the dilated time `Δt`, which is given by `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\nWe can combine these formulas:\n`d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n*   The numerator `(v * Δt₀)` is the classical distance: `3,000,000 km`.\n*   The denominator is the relativistic correction: `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n*   `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n*   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, the value is closest to **3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from our qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Recognize the Need for Relativity:** The most important first step is realizing that `v = 0.2c` is a relativistic speed, making the classical answer of 3,000,000 km (Option B) incorrect, even though it's provided as a tempting distractor.\n*   **Correctly Identify Proper Time:** A common mistake in these problems is confusing which time is which. The \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) is always the time measured by a clock in the same frame as the event's duration (here, the clock is on the ejecta). The time given, `50 s`, is the proper time.\n*   **The Power of the Sanity Check:** In many multiple-choice relativity questions, calculating the classical answer first and then using the direction of the relativistic effect (time *dilation* means the observer's time is *longer*, so distance is *greater*) is sufficient to eliminate all incorrect options and find the solution.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem is solved by finding the time that passes in the observer's (Galaxy's) frame and multiplying it by the velocity. It is a time dilation problem. Applying length contraction would be inappropriate for this specific question setup.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity. An analysis of all the candidate answers shows a unanimous consensus on the physics, the required formula, and the final numerical result. The only discrepancy is the lettered choice, which is an artifact of the options being presented in a different order.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves an object (the supernova ejecta) moving at `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's velocity is `v/c = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. At such a high velocity, the effects described by Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity are significant, and classical physics is no longer accurate. The key principle here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The time given, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time.\"\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time interval for the same event as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**\nThis crucial step can often solve the problem without complex calculation.\n1.  First, calculate the non-relativistic (classical) distance, which would be `distance = velocity × time`.\n    `Classical Distance = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    This corresponds to option **B**.\n2.  The principle of time dilation states that from a stationary observer's perspective (the Galaxy), a moving clock (the ejecta's clock) runs slower. This means that for 50 seconds to pass in the ejecta's frame, a *longer* time must have passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n3.  Since the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = velocity × (time in Galaxy's frame)`, and the time in the Galaxy's frame is *greater than 50 seconds*, the resulting distance must be **greater than 3,000,000 km**.\n4.  Looking at the options:\n    *   A) 2 880 000 km (less than 3,000,000 km)\n    *   B) 3 000 000 km (the incorrect classical answer)\n    *   C) 3 060 000 km (**greater than 3,000,000 km**)\n    *   D) 2 940 000 km (less than 3,000,000 km)\n5.  This logical check alone is sufficient to conclude that **C** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm the logical conclusion, we perform the full relativistic calculation. The formula that combines the distance calculation with time dilation is:\n`d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nThe code execution provided the precise result for this calculation: `3,061,862.178... km`.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude by Comparing with Options**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options from the original question:\n*   A) 2 880 000 km\n*   B) 3 000 000 km\n*   C) 3 060 000 km\n*   D) 2 940 000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Proper Time vs. Dilated Time**: It is essential to correctly identify the given `50 s` as the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the moving object's frame. The distance is asked for in the stationary frame, which experiences dilated time (`Δt`).\n2.  **Relativity Increases the Result**: Time dilation leads to a *longer* time measurement in the stationary frame, thus a *longer* distance compared to a classical calculation. Any answer smaller than the classical result is immediately incorrect.\n3.  **Classical Answer as a Distractor**: Multiple-choice questions in relativity often include the classical result (`3,000,000 km`) as a distractor option (option B).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the correct formula, and the final numerical result. The minor discrepancies in the letter choices of the answers are confirmed to be artifacts of their internal processing of the multiple-choice options, not any error in the physics or math. Here is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem states the ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. This speed is 20% of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`). Because this velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light, the principles of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity must be used, not classical physics. The key phenomenon at play here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame. The time elapsed in this frame is the dilated time, `Δt`.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. The given time of 50 seconds passes in this frame. This is the **proper time (`Δt₀`)**.\n    *   **Given values:** `v = 60,000 km/s`, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n3.  **Qualitative Analysis (The \"Sanity Check\" Method)**: Before performing complex calculations, a logical check can often identify the correct answer. This method was successfully used by all the analyzed agents.\n    *   **Classical Calculation**: First, calculate the distance if we were to ignore relativistic effects:\n        `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n        This corresponds to option **D**.\n    *   **Relativistic Effect**: The theory of time dilation states that a moving clock (on the ejecta) runs slower from the perspective of a stationary observer (in the Galaxy). This means that for 50 seconds (`Δt₀`) to pass in the ejecta's frame, a *longer* time interval (`Δt`) must pass in the Galaxy's frame. Therefore, `Δt > 50 s`.\n    *   **Logical Conclusion**: The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50s`, the distance `d` *must* be greater than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n    *   **Reviewing the Options**:\n        A) 2 880 000 km. (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n        B) 2 940 000 km. (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n        C) 3 060 000 km. (**Correct**, this is the only option greater than the classical distance)\n        D) 3 000 000 km. (Incorrect, this is the classical distance)\n    This logical check alone is sufficient to determine the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Quantitative Calculation (for Confirmation)**: To confirm the sanity check, we perform the full relativistic calculation.\n    *   The distance in the stationary (Galaxy) frame is `d = v × Δt`.\n    *   The dilated time `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor (`γ`): `Δt = γ × Δt₀`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor `γ` is defined as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining these gives the direct formula for the distance: `d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Plugging in the known values:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s × 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 `\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Final Decision**: The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, the value is closest to **C) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from the qualitative sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Recognizing the Need for Relativity:** The most common mistake in such problems is to perform a classical calculation (`d=v*t`), which yields `3,000,000 km`. The speed being 20% that of light (`0.2c`) is a clear signal that relativity is required.\n*   **Correctly Identifying Proper Time:** It is absolutely critical to identify the given `50 s` as the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the object's own moving reference frame. Confusing proper time with observer time is a frequent error.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem is solved using time dilation because it provides a time interval in one frame and asks for a distance in another, which is a function of that frame's time. We find the time as measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) and then use `d = v × Δt`. Length contraction is a different, though related, effect concerning an object's measured dimensions.\n*   **The Direction of the Effect:** Time *dilation* means the time measured by the stationary observer is *longer* than the proper time. Consequently, the distance measured by the stationary observer (`d = v × Δt`) is *greater* than the classical distance calculated using proper time (`v × Δt₀`). This simple rule provides the powerful basis for the sanity check.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong and unanimous consensus on the physics principles, the required formula, and the final numerical result. The variation in the final letter choices (e.g., A, B, C, D) among the answers is simply an artifact of their individual systems processing the multiple-choice options in different orders; their underlying analysis and conclusion about the correct *value* are identical.\n\nHere is a definitive, consolidated step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe supernova ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light `c` is approximately `300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's velocity is `v/c = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. Because this speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, classical physics (d = v*t) is not accurate. The problem must be solved using Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key principle is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from this frame (`d`).\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt'` or `Δt₀`):** The time measured in the moving frame, given as `50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest relative to the events it is timing (i.e., a clock on the ejecta).\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time interval that passes in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**\nThis logical step, employed by all the candidate answers, can often solve the problem without requiring a calculator.\n1.  **Calculate the classical distance:** First, find the distance ignoring relativity, which provides a baseline.\n    `d_classical = v × Δt' = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to **Option C** in the question.\n2.  **Apply the principle of time dilation:** Time dilation states that a moving clock (on the ejecta) appears to run slower from the perspective of a stationary observer (in the Galaxy). This means that for 50 seconds to pass on the ejecta's clock, a **longer** period of time must have passed in the Galaxy's frame. So, `Δt > 50 s`.\n3.  **Draw a conclusion:** The distance we need to find is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the actual distance `d` **must be greater than** the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Review the options:**\n    *   A) 2 940 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km -> Incorrect)\n    *   B) 3 060 000 km (**Greater than 3,000,000 km -> Plausible**)\n    *   C) 3 000 000 km (The classical result itself -> Incorrect)\n    *   D) 2 880 000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km -> Incorrect)\nThis sanity check is sufficient to determine that **B** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm the logical conclusion, we perform the full relativistic calculation. The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is `d = v × Δt`. First, we find the dilated time `Δt` from the proper time `Δt'` using the Lorentz factor `γ`.\nThe combined formula is: `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n`d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96) `\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Compare and Conclude**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the options provided, it is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the conclusion from our sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Physics:** The most crucial first step is to recognize that the speed (0.2c) necessitates the use of special relativity. Using classical physics yields 3,000,000 km, which is incorrect but is typically offered as a distractor option (Option C).\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** A very common mistake in relativity problems is misidentifying the proper time. The proper time (`Δt'`) is always the time measured in the frame that is at rest relative to the event being timed—in this case, the `50 s` measured by a clock on the ejecta.\n3.  **Time Dilation Implication:** Remember that time *dilation* means the time measured in the stationary frame is *longer*. Consequently, the distance calculated using this dilated time will be *greater* than the classical distance. Any answer smaller than the classical one is immediately wrong.\n4.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** The problem is solved most directly using time dilation, as we are given a time interval in the moving frame and asked for a distance in the stationary frame. This requires calculating the corresponding time (`Δt`) in the stationary frame.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong and unanimous consensus on the physics, the correct formula, and the final numerical result. The variance in the letter choices (A, B, C, or D) across the different answers is an artifact of the agents processing randomized lists of options, not a disagreement on the correct value. The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis based on their collective reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem states the ejecta is moving at a velocity of `v = 60,000 km/s`. This is 20% of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`). At such a high speed, classical physics is not sufficient. The problem involves comparing time and distance between two different inertial reference frames (the Galaxy and the ejecta), so it must be solved using **Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity**. The key phenomenon here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The given time, `50 s`, is measured by a clock within the moving frame (the ejecta). This is the \"proper time.\"\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`):** The time interval for the same event as measured by an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"**\nThis logical step is extremely powerful and can often solve the problem without a full calculation.\n1.  **Calculate the classical distance:** First, calculate the distance if we ignored relativistic effects:\n    `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km.`\n    This corresponds to option **B**.\n2.  **Apply the relativistic principle:** The theory of time dilation states that a clock in the moving frame (ejecta) is observed to run slower than a clock in the stationary frame (Galaxy). This means that for 50 seconds to pass for the ejecta, a **longer** time (`Δt > 50 s`) must pass in the Galaxy's frame.\n3.  **Draw the logical conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the relativistic distance `d` **must be greater** than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Review the options:**\n    A) 3 060 000 km (**Plausible** - greater than 3,000,000 km)\n    B) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect - this is the classical result)\n    C) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect - less than the classical result)\n    D) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect - less than the classical result)\nThis sanity check is sufficient to determine that **A** is the only physically possible answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Quantitative Calculation**\nTo confirm our logical conclusion, we perform the precise calculation. The distance `d` is found using the dilated time `Δt`. The relationship is:\n`d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n*   The numerator `(v × Δt₀)` is the classical distance: `3,000,000 km`.\n*   The denominator corrects for relativity:\n    `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`\n*   Now, calculate the final distance:\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.979796...`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to option **A) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the result from the sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Physics:** The most common mistake is to perform a simple classical calculation (`d=v*t`), which yields `3,000,000 km`. This answer is included as a distractor (Option B). The speed being 20% of `c` is a clear signal that relativity is mandatory.\n2.  **Proper Time Identification:** It is critical to identify the given `50 s` as the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the moving object's own reference frame. Misidentifying this as the observer's time (`Δt`) would lead to an incorrect calculation.\n3.  **Time Dilation, Not Length Contraction:** The problem gives a time in the moving frame and asks for a distance in the stationary frame. The direct approach is to calculate the time that passed in the stationary frame (the dilated time) and use that to find the distance. This is a time dilation problem.\n4.  **The Power of the Sanity Check:** For many multiple-choice relativity problems, understanding the *direction* of the effect is sufficient. Knowing that the time for the observer is longer, and therefore the distance measured by the observer is greater, is a powerful tool to eliminate incorrect answers and guard against calculation errors.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a problem concerning Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.

The question asks for the distance (`d`) traveled by the ejecta as measured by an observer in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The reference frame of the ejecta.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time interval of `50 s` is measured by a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta). This is known as the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest relative to the event being timed.\n\n**3. Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\":**\nThis is a powerful method used by all the candidate answers to quickly solve the problem or verify the result.\n1.  **Classical Calculation:** First, calculate the distance as if we could ignore relativity.\n    `d_classical = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    This corresponds to option **A** in the problem statement.\n2.  **Relativistic Effect:** The principle of time dilation states that from the perspective of a stationary observer (in the Galaxy), a moving clock (on the ejecta) runs slower. This means that for 50 seconds to pass in the ejecta's frame, a *longer* time must have passed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt > 50 s`).\n3.  **Logical Conclusion:** The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Since `v` is constant and `Δt > 50 s`, the resulting distance `d` *must* be greater than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n4.  **Review the Options:**\n    *   A) 3 000 000 km (Incorrect, this is the classical distance)\n    *   B) 2 880 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n    *   C) 3 060 000 km (**Correct**, the only option greater than the classical distance)\n    *   D) 2 940 000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical distance)\n\nThis logical check alone is sufficient to identify **C** as the correct answer.\n\n**4. Perform the Quantitative Calculation (for Confirmation):**\nTo confirm the logical conclusion, we perform the full relativistic calculation.\n1.  The dilated time (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt₀`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `Δt = γ × Δt₀`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n2.  The distance in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`. Combining these gives the direct formula for distance:\n    `d = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n3.  Plugging in the known values:\n    `d = (60,000 km/s × 50 s) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.2²) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04) `\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 `\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 `\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**5. Final Conclusion:**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this with the provided options, it is closest to **C) 3,060,000 km**. This confirms the result from the sanity check.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Recognizing the Need for Relativity:** The most critical first step is to note that the speed (20% of `c`) is high enough to make relativistic effects non-negligible. The classical calculation is often included as a distractor option.\n*   **Correctly Identifying Proper Time:** A common pitfall in relativity problems is misidentifying the proper time. Proper time (`Δt₀`) is *always* the time measured by a clock in the same reference frame as the event it is timing (i.e., the clock is on the moving ejecta).\n*   **Applying the Correct Relativistic Effect:** This problem requires time dilation. The time for the event is measured as being *longer* in the stationary frame, leading to a *greater* distance traveled than in the classical case. An incorrect understanding could lead one to pick a value smaller than the classical one.\n*   **The Power of the Sanity Check:** As demonstrated, a simple qualitative check based on the direction of the relativistic effect (time gets longer, so distance gets greater) can often solve multiple-choice problems directly and serves as a check against calculation errors.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
