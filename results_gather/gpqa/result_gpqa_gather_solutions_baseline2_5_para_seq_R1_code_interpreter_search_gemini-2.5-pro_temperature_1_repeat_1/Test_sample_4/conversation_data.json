Construct the Operator ($P_n$)**\nThe first step is to construct the matrix for the spin operator along the arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$.\n*   **Direction Vector ($\\vec{n}$):** The vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A unit vector in this plane can be parameterized by its angle $\\theta$ relative to the positive z-axis. The components of this unit vector are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   **Spin Operator along $\\vec{n}$:** The operator $P_n$ is the dot product of the spin operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$.\n*   Since $n_y=0$, this simplifies to $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$.\n*   Substituting the given matrix forms for $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\nWe must find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that corresponds to the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n*   $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The constant factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ cancels from both sides. The top row of the matrix multiplication gives the equation:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n**3. Determine and Normalize the Eigenvector Components**\nWe now solve for the relationship between the components $a$ and $b$ and then normalize.\n*   Rearranging the equation: $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   This gives the ratio of the components: $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$.\n*   Using the trigonometric half-angle identities ($1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$) is the key simplification step:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n*   This relationship implies the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   To normalize the vector, we check the sum of the squared magnitudes of the components: $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = 1$. The vector is already normalized.\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Physical Units:** An eigenvector representing a quantum state is a dimensionless vector in an abstract space (Hilbert space). It should not contain physical constants with units, such as $\\hbar$. This immediately invalidates any options containing $\\hbar$.\n2.  **Angular Dependence:** For a spin-1/2 particle (a spinor), a rotation in physical space by an angle $\\theta$ corresponds to a transformation in its quantum state that involves the half-angle, $\\theta/2$. The final answer must reflect this dependence.\n3.  **Normalization:** The state vector must have a unit norm, meaning the sum of the squared absolute values of its components must equal 1. This is a requirement for the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n4.  **Trigonometric Simplification:** The correct application of half-angle identities is the critical mathematical step that transforms the problem from a complex ratio into a simple, standard form.\n5.  **Reconciling Candidate Answers:** The unanimity of the derivation across all candidate answers provides extremely high confidence in the mathematical result. The variety in final letter choices is an artifact that should be ignored; the correct mathematical result must be matched against the specific options list in the problem statement.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the rigorously derived result **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$** with the specific list of options provided in the question:\n*   A) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect. Contains $\\hbar$ and lacks angular dependence.\n*   B) **(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))** - **Correct.** This is a perfect match to the derived result. It is dimensionless, normalized, and has the correct half-angle dependence.\n*   C) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect. The angular dependence is on $\\theta$, not $\\theta/2$.\n*   D) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect. Contains $\\hbar$ and is not properly normalized.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis task requires a final decision on the correct answer to a quantum mechanics problem based on an analysis of multiple candidate answers. The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the physical principles and mathematical derivation required. The discrepancy in the final letter choices is due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different order to each agent.\n\nThe definitive solution can be found by synthesizing the unanimous derivation and then matching the result to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the normalized eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ of the operator $P_n$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n\n**1. Construct the Spin Operator in the direction $\\vec{n}$**\n*   **Direction Vector:** The direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A unit vector in this plane is parameterized by the polar angle $\\theta$ relative to the z-axis. Its Cartesian components are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   **Operator $P_n$:** The operator is the dot product of the spin vector operator $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n*   Since the y-component of $\\vec{n}$ is zero, this simplifies to $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$. Substituting the given matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n*   We need to solve the equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The factor of $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides. Using the top row of the matrix equation gives:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n**3. Determine and Normalize the Eigenvector Components**\n*   Rearranging the equation to find the ratio of the components $b/a$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta) \\implies \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n*   Using the trigonometric half-angle identities ($1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$) is the key to simplifying this expression:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n*   This relationship implies the eigenvector is proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The final step is to normalize the vector. The squared norm is $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = 1$. The vector is already normalized.\n\nThe correct mathematical expression for the elements of the normalized eigenvector is **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n1.  **Physical Units:** An eigenvector represents a quantum state, which is a dimensionless vector in an abstract Hilbert space. Options containing the physical constant $\\hbar$ (which has units of action or angular momentum) are dimensionally incorrect for a state vector. This is a fundamental error.\n2.  **Angular Dependence:** For a spin-1/2 particle (a spinor), a physical rotation by an angle $\\theta$ corresponds to a transformation in its quantum state space that involves the half-angle, $\\theta/2$. Any answer depending on $\\theta$ rather than $\\theta/2$ is incorrect for this type of problem.\n3.  **Normalization:** The total probability of finding the particle in any state must be 1. This means the state vector must be a unit vector, i.e., the sum of the squared absolute values of its components must equal 1.\n4.  **Operator Construction:** It is crucial to correctly construct the operator $P_n$ using the dot product and the correct parameterization of the direction vector $\\vec{n}$. The absence of a $y$-component in $\\vec{n}$ correctly simplifies the problem by excluding the $P_y$ operator.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nWe compare the rigorously derived result **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$** with the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - **Incorrect.** The angular dependence is on $\\theta$, not $\\theta/2$. The phase factor $e^{i\\phi}$ is also extraneous for a vector in the x-z plane.\n*   B) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - **Incorrect.** This option contains the constant $\\hbar$, making it dimensionally wrong, and it is not correctly normalized.\n*   C) **(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))** - **Correct.** This option perfectly matches the derived mathematical result. It is dimensionless, normalized, and has the correct half-angle dependence.\n*   D) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - **Incorrect.** This contains $\\hbar$ and lacks any angular dependence.\n\nThe only option that satisfies all the physical and mathematical requirements is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers from other agents, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the correct mathematical derivation required to solve the problem.

The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers are due to different orderings of the multiple-choice options they were presented with, not due to any disagreement in their physical or mathematical reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe solution follows a standard procedure in quantum mechanics:\n\n1.  **Construct the Operator:** The first step is to create the matrix representation of the spin operator for the specified direction $\\vec{n}$.\n    *   **Direction Vector ($\\vec{n}$):** The direction lies in the x-z plane. A unit vector in this plane is parameterized by a polar angle $\\theta$ measured from the z-axis. The Cartesian components of this vector are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n    *   **Operator ($P_n$):** The operator for the spin component along $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$.

Construct the Spin Operator in the direction $\\vec{n}$**\n*   The first step is to define the direction vector, $\\vec{n}$. Since it lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized by a single polar angle, $\\theta$, which is the angle it makes with the positive z-axis. The unit vector is thus $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   The operator for the spin component along $\\vec{n}$, denoted $P_n$, is the dot product of the spin operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n*   Since $n_y=0$, and substituting the given matrix representations for $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n    $P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2.

The Cartesian components of this unit vector are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   **Spin Operator ($P_n$):** The operator for the spin component along $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product of the spin operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n*   Given $n_y=0$, and substituting the provided matrix representations for $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n    $P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2.

Using the top row of the matrix multiplication yields the equation:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n**3. Determine and Normalize the Eigenvector Components**\n\nFrom the equation above, we solve for the ratio of the components `b` and `a`.\n*   Rearranging the equation: $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta)$, which leads to the ratio $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$.\n*   This expression is simplified using the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n*   Substituting these into the ratio gives:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n*   This relationship implies that the eigenvector is proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   Finally, we check for normalization.

The final answer must show this half-angle dependence. This rules out option A, which depends on $\\theta$.\n3.  **Normalization:** The total probability of finding the particle in any possible state must be 1.

Its components are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   **Spin Operator ($P_n$):** The operator is the dot product of the spin vector operator $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n*   Since the y-component of $\\vec{n}$ is zero, we substitute the x and z components:\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\nThe problem asks for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that corresponds to the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. We must solve the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n*   $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The constant factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ cancels from both sides, leaving a simpler system of linear equations. Using the first row, we get:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n**3. Determine the Eigenvector Components and Normalize**\nWe rearrange the equation to find the relationship between the components $a$ and $b$:\n*   $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta) \\implies \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n*   This expression is simplified using the trigonometric half-angle identities: $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n*   This relationship shows that the eigenvector must be proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The final step is to normalize the vector. The squared norm is $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = 1$. The vector is already normalized.\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Physical Units:** An eigenvector represents a quantum state, which is a dimensionless abstract vector. It must not contain physical constants like $\\hbar$ that have units. This immediately rules out options B and D on fundamental physical grounds.\n2.  **Angle Dependence:** For a spin-1/2 particle (a spinor), the state vector's dependence on a physical rotation angle $\\theta$ appears as $\\theta/2$. This is a fundamental property of spinors, distinguishing them from classical vectors. This rules out option C, which depends on $\\theta$.\n3.  **Normalization:** A quantum state vector must be normalized to unity, which means the sum of the squared magnitudes of its components must equal 1. Our result $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$ satisfies this.\n4.  **Trigonometric Simplification:** The correct application of the half-angle identities is the key mathematical step that simplifies the problem from a cumbersome ratio to its standard, elegant form.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nThe unanimously agreed-upon mathematical result from the derivations is that the eigenvector's elements are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.

Its Cartesian components are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n    *   **Operator ($P_n$):** The operator for the spin component along $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$. Given that the y-component of $\\vec{n}$ is zero, this simplifies to $P_n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z$.\n    *   **Matrix Representation:** Substituting the given matrix forms for $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n        $P_n = \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\cos\\theta$\n        $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n    The next step is to find the eigenvector, which we can write as $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$, that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The constant factor of $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides, leaving a simpler system of linear equations.

To normalize this vector, we calculate the sum of the squared magnitudes of its components: $|\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n    *   The vector is already normalized. Thus, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Physical Units:** An eigenvector represents a quantum state and is a dimensionless vector in an abstract Hilbert space. Any option containing the physical constant $\\hbar$, which has units of angular momentum, is fundamentally incorrect for a state vector. This immediately eliminates options A and B.\n*   **Angle Dependence:** For a spin-1/2 particle (a spinor), a physical rotation of the measurement axis by an angle $\\theta$ results in a transformation in the quantum state that involves the half-angle, $\\theta/2$. The final eigenvector must reflect this characteristic property. Option C has a dependence on $\\theta$ (and an irrelevant phase factor $e^{i\\phi}$), making it incorrect.\n*   **Normalization:** Any valid quantum state vector must be a unit vector, as the squared magnitudes of its components represent probabilities that must sum to 1. The derived vector $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ correctly satisfies the normalization condition $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n*   **Eigenvalue Specification:** The calculation was performed for the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$, as requested.

This involves a standard, universally agreed-upon procedure in quantum mechanics.\n\n**Step 1: Construct the Operator in the specified direction `n`**\nThe first step is to create the matrix representation for the operator that measures spin along the arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$.\n*   **Direction Vector ($\\vec{n}$):** Since the direction lies in the x-z plane, a unit vector can be parameterized by a single polar angle $\\theta$ relative to the +z-axis. Its Cartesian components are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   **Spin Operator ($P_n$):** The operator for the spin component along $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product of the spin operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$. Since the y-component of $\\vec{n}$ is zero, this simplifies to:\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$.\n*   **Matrix Representation:** Substituting the given matrix representations for $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 2: Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\nWe must find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that corresponds to the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.

Formulate the Operator in the Direction `n`**\nThe first step is to construct the operator $P_n$ corresponding to a spin measurement along the direction $\\vec{n}$.\n*   **Direction Vector `n`**: The direction $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. It is correctly parameterized by the polar angle $\\theta$ relative to the z-axis. The Cartesian components of this vector are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   **Operator `P_n`**: The operator is the dot product of the spin operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$.\n*   Since $n_y = 0$, the expression simplifies to $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$. Substituting the given matrix representations:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**2. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\nNext, we solve the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. Let the eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The equation is:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The constant factor $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides. Using the top row of the matrix equation gives the linear equation:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$.\n\n**3. Determine and Normalize the Eigenvector**\nThe final step is to find the ratio of the components `a` and `b` and normalize the resulting vector.\n*   Rearranging the equation: $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   This gives the ratio of the components: $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$.\n*   Using the trigonometric half-angle identities ($1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$) is the key to simplification:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n*   This relationship implies the eigenvector is proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   To normalize this vector, we calculate the sum of the squared magnitudes of the components: $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = 1$. Since the result is 1, the vector is already normalized.\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Physical Units:** An eigenvector represents a quantum state, which is a dimensionless vector in an abstract Hilbert space. It must not contain physical constants like $\\hbar$, which has units of angular momentum. Any options including $\\hbar$ are fundamentally incorrect on dimensional grounds. This invalidates options C and D.\n2.  **Half-Angle Dependence:** A defining characteristic of spin-1/2 particles (spinors) is that a physical rotation of the measurement axis by an angle $\\theta$ results in a transformation in the state space that involves $\\theta/2$. The final eigenvector must reflect this half-angle dependence. This invalidates option B, which depends on $\\theta$.\n3.  **Normalization:** A quantum state vector must be normalized to have a length of 1, as the sum of the squared magnitudes of its components corresponds to the total probability. The result `(cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))` satisfies this with $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n4.  **Correct Eigenvalue:** The calculation must be performed for the specified eigenvalue of $+\\hbar/2$. Using the other eigenvalue, $-\\hbar/2$, would produce the orthogonal eigenvector.\n5.  **Trigonometric Simplification:** The correct application of half-angle identities is the critical mathematical step that transforms the component ratio into its simple, final form.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nComparing the rigorously derived mathematical result **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$** with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))**: This is a perfect match. It is dimensionless, normalized, and has the correct half-angle dependence.\n*   **B) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))**: Incorrect. Has the wrong angular dependence and an extraneous phase factor.\n*   **C) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))**: Incorrect. Contains the dimensionful constant $\\hbar$ and is not correctly normalized.\n*   **D) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)**: Incorrect.

The Cartesian components of this unit vector are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n    *   **The Operator ($P_n$)**: The operator is the dot product of the spin operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n        $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$.\n        With $n_y=0$, this simplifies to $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$.\n    *   **Matrix Representation**: Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n        $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**: We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that satisfies the equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The constant factor $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides. Using the top row of the matrix equation gives:\n        $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n3.  **Determine and Normalize the Eigenvector**:\n    *   We rearrange the equation to find the ratio of the components: $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta) \\implies \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$.\n    *   The key to simplifying this expression is to use the trigonometric half-angle identities: $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n        $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    *   This relationship implies the eigenvector is proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   To normalize, we calculate the sum of the squared magnitudes of the components: $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = 1$. The vector is already normalized.\n\nThe correct mathematical result for the elements of the normalized eigenvector is **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Physical Units**: Eigenvectors representing quantum states are abstract, dimensionless vectors in a Hilbert space. They should not contain physical constants with units, such as $\\hbar$. Any option including $\\hbar$ is fundamentally incorrect on dimensional grounds. This invalidates options A and D.\n*   **Angle Dependence**: For spin-1/2 particles (spinors), a rotation in physical space by an angle $\\theta$ corresponds to a transformation in its quantum state space that involves the angle $\\theta/2$. The final answer must show this characteristic half-angle dependence. This invalidates option C, which depends on $\\theta$.\n*   **Normalization**: A state vector must be a unit vector. The derived result is correctly normalized as $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n*   **Correct Eigenvalue**: The entire calculation depends on using the specified eigenvalue, $+\\hbar/2$. Using the other eigenvalue, $-\\hbar/2$, would lead to the orthogonal eigenvector.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nWe now compare the rigorously derived result, $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$, with the provided list of options:\n\n*   **A) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)**: Incorrect. Contains $\\hbar$ and has no angular dependence.\n*   **B) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))**: **Correct**. This is a perfect match to the derived result.\n*   **C) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))**: Incorrect. It has the wrong angular dependence ($\\theta$ instead of $\\theta/2$).\n*   **D) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))**: Incorrect. Contains $\\hbar$ and is not correctly normalized.\n\nThe analysis confirms that only one option is consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics and the specifics of the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the correct mathematical derivation required to solve the problem. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers are due to different orderings of the multiple-choice options they were presented with, not due to any disagreement in their physical or mathematical reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe solution follows a standard procedure in quantum mechanics:\n\n1.  **Construct the Operator:** The first step is to create the matrix representation of the spin operator for the specified direction $\\vec{n}$.\n    *   **Direction Vector ($\\vec{n}$):** The direction lies in the x-z plane. A unit vector in this plane is parameterized by a polar angle $\\theta$ measured from the z-axis. The Cartesian components of this vector are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n    *   **Operator ($P_n$):** The operator for the spin component along $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$. As $n_y=0$, this simplifies to $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$.\n    *   **Matrix Representation:** Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n        $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation:** We must find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that solves the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n    *   The equation is:\n        $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The factor $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides. Using the top row of the matrix multiplication gives the linear equation:\n        $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n3.  **Determine and Normalize the Eigenvector Components:** We rearrange the equation to find the ratio of the components $b/a$.\n    *   $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    *   $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n    *   Using the trigonometric half-angle identities ($1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$), the expression simplifies:\n        $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    *   This relationship implies the eigenvector is proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The final step is to check for normalization. The sum of the squared magnitudes is $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = 1$. The vector is already normalized.\n\nThe correct mathematical expression for the components of the normalized eigenvector is **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Physical Units:** An eigenvector representing a quantum state is a dimensionless vector in an abstract Hilbert space. Options containing the physical constant $\\hbar$, which has units of angular momentum, are fundamentally incorrect on dimensional grounds. This immediately eliminates options C and D.\n2.  **Half-Angle Dependence:** For a spin-1/2 particle (a spinor), a rotation of the measurement axis by an angle $\\theta$ in physical space corresponds to a transformation of its quantum state that involves the half-angle, $\\theta/2$. The correct answer must exhibit this dependence. This eliminates option A, which depends on $\\theta$.\n3.  **Normalization:** Any state vector in quantum mechanics must be a unit vector, which corresponds to the total probability of finding the particle in any state being 1. The derived vector $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ satisfies the normalization condition $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n4.  **Correct Eigenvalue:** The calculation was performed for the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$ as requested in the problem. Using the other possible eigenvalue, $-\\hbar/2$, would have resulted in the orthogonal eigenvector.\n5.  **Operator Construction:** The correct construction of the operator $P_n$ from the dot product is a critical first step. Since the direction vector has no y-component, the operator $P_y$ does not contribute, which simplifies the calculation.\n\n### Final Answer Determination\n\nWe now compare the rigorously derived and unanimously agreed-upon result with the specific options provided in this question's prompt:\n\n*   A) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect. The angular dependence is on $\\theta$, not $\\theta/2$.\n*   B) **(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))** - **Correct.** This is a perfect match to the derived result.\n*   C) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect.

Contains $\\hbar$ and lacks the required angular dependence.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a standard problem in quantum mechanics. A thorough analysis of the provided answers shows that all agents agree on the correct mathematical derivation but were presented with different multiple-choice options, leading to different final letter choices. The consensus on the derivation is a strong indicator of its correctness.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe definitive solution is found by rigorously executing the standard procedure for this type of problem.\n\n**1. Construct the Spin Operator in the direction $\\vec{n}$**\n*   The first step is to define the direction vector, $\\vec{n}$. Since it lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized by a single polar angle, $\\theta$, which is the angle it makes with the positive z-axis. The unit vector is thus $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   The operator for the spin component along $\\vec{n}$, denoted $P_n$, is the dot product of the spin operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n*   Since $n_y=0$, and substituting the given matrix representations for $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n    $P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n*   We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that solves the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n*   The equation is:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The constant factor $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides, leaving a simpler system of linear equations. Using the first row, we get:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n**3. Determine and Normalize the Eigenvector Components**\n*   We rearrange the equation to find the ratio of the components $a$ and $b$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n*   This expression is greatly simplified using the trigonometric half-angle identities: $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n*   This relationship implies the eigenvector is proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   Finally, we check for normalization. The sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components must be 1.\n    $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n*   The vector is already normalized. Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Physical Units:** An eigenvector represents a quantum state vector in an abstract Hilbert space. These vectors are dimensionless. Options that include the physical constant $\\hbar$ (which has units of angular momentum) are fundamentally incorrect. This immediately eliminates options A and C.\n2.  **Angular Dependence for Spin-1/2 Particles:** A defining characteristic of spin-1/2 particles (also known as spinors) is that their state description transforms under rotation in a way that involves half the angle of physical rotation. The answer must depend on $\\theta/2$, not $\\theta$. This eliminates option D.\n3.  **Normalization:** The state vector must be normalized to unity ($\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$), corresponding to the total probability of finding the particle in any state being 1. The derived vector $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ correctly meets this requirement.\n4.  **Trigonometric Simplification:** The key mathematical step that transitions the solution from a complex ratio to a simple, recognizable form is the correct application of the half-angle identities. All candidate answers correctly performed this step.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nWe compare the rigorously derived and universally confirmed result $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ with the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect.

It has the wrong angular dependence (using $\\theta$ instead of $\\theta/2$).\n\nThe only option that satisfies all the physical and mathematical requirements is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum spin operator along a specific direction. An analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous agreement on the mathematical derivation, even though the final letter choices vary. This indicates that the reasoning across all agents is sound, and the differences in the final answer choice are merely artifacts of a randomized option list.

We must solve the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    *   The equation is:\n        $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The constant factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ cancels from both sides, leaving a simpler system of linear equations. Using the first row, we get:\n        $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n3.  **Determine and Normalize the Eigenvector Components**\n    We rearrange the equation to find the relationship between the components $a$ and $b$:\n    *   $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta) \\implies \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n    *   This expression is simplified using the trigonometric half-angle identities: $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n        $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    *   This relationship shows that the eigenvector must be proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   To normalize the eigenvector, the sum of the squared magnitudes of its components must equal 1.

Formulate the Operator for the Specified Direction**\nThe task is to find an eigenvector of the spin operator $\\vec{P}$ projected along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane.\n*   **Direction Vector `n`:** A unit vector $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane can be parameterized by its polar angle $\\theta$ (the angle relative to the positive z-axis). Its components are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   **Operator `P_n`:** The operator for the spin component along $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$. Given that the y-component of $\\vec{n}$ is zero, this simplifies to $P_n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$.\n*   **Matrix Representation:** Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n    $P_n = \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\nWe must find the eigenvector, let's call it $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$, that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.

Construct the Operator for Spin along direction `n`**\n\n*   First, we must define the direction vector, $\\vec{n}$. Since it lies in the x-z plane, we can parameterize this unit vector by its polar angle $\\theta$ relative to the z-axis. The Cartesian components are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   Next, we construct the operator $P_n$ by taking the dot product of the spin operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n*   Since $n_y=0$, the equation simplifies to $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$.\n*   Substituting the given matrix representations for the spin components:\n    $P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\n*   We must find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n*   The equation is:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The constant factor $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides, leaving a simpler system of linear equations. Using the top row of the matrix equation, we get:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n**3. Determine and Normalize the Eigenvector Components**\n\n*   Rearranging the equation to find the relationship between the components `a` and `b`:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta) \\implies \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n*   This expression is simplified using the trigonometric half-angle identities ($1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$):\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n*   This relationship implies the eigenvector is proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The final step is to normalize the vector. We calculate the squared norm: $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = 1$. Since the norm is 1, the vector is already normalized.\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Physical Units:** An eigenvector represents a quantum state, which is a dimensionless vector in an abstract Hilbert space. It must not contain physical constants like $\\hbar$. This fundamental principle immediately eliminates options A and C, which are not dimensionless.\n2.  **Half-Angle Dependence:** A defining characteristic of spin-1/2 particles (spinors) is that their state description involves half-angles ($\\theta/2$) of the physical orientation ($\\theta$). The final answer must reflect this property. Option D, which depends on $\\theta$, is incorrect for a spinor state.\n3.  **Normalization:** A quantum state vector must be a unit vector, as the sum of the squared magnitudes of its components represents a total probability of 1. The derived vector $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ satisfies this condition, as $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n4.  **Correct Eigenvalue:** The calculation was performed for the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$ as requested. Using the other possible eigenvalue, $-\\hbar/2$, would have produced the orthogonal eigenvector.\n5.  **Consensus Reasoning:** All provided candidate answers, regardless of their final letter choice, used the same correct derivation, indicating extremely high confidence in the mathematical result.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the rigorously derived and unanimously confirmed mathematical result, **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**, with the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect (contains $\\hbar$).\n*   B) **(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))** - **This is a perfect match to the derived result.**\n*   C) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect (contains $\\hbar$).\n*   D) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect (wrong angular dependence).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis task requires a definitive decision on the correct answer to a quantum mechanics problem by analyzing and synthesizing the reasoning from multiple agents. A review of the provided candidate answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the correct physical principles and mathematical derivation. The discrepancies in the final letter choices stem from the multiple-choice options being presented in different orders to each agent. The definitive answer can be found by rigorously performing the derivation and matching the result to the specific list of options provided in the problem prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Construct the Spin Operator**\n\nThe first step is to create the operator matrix for a spin measurement along the arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$.\n*   **Direction Vector ($\\vec{n}$):** The direction lies in the x-z plane. A unit vector in this plane can be parameterized by its angle $\\theta$ relative to the positive z-axis. The Cartesian components of this unit vector are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   **Spin Operator ($P_n$):** The operator for the spin component along $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product of the spin operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n*   Given $n_y=0$, and substituting the provided matrix representations for $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n    $P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n*   The equation is:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The constant factor of $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides. Using the top row of the matrix multiplication yields the equation:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n**3. Determine and Normalize the Eigenvector Components**\n\nFrom the equation above, we solve for the ratio of the components `b` and `a`.\n*   Rearranging the equation: $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta)$, which leads to the ratio $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$.\n*   This expression is simplified using the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n*   Substituting these into the ratio gives:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n*   This relationship implies that the eigenvector is proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   Finally, we check for normalization. The squared norm is $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = 1$. Since the norm is 1, the vector is already normalized. The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Physical Units:** An eigenvector representing a quantum state is a dimensionless vector in an abstract Hilbert space. It must not contain physical constants with units, such as $\\hbar$. This allows us to immediately rule out options B and D on fundamental grounds.\n2.  **Angle Dependence (Spinor Property):** For a spin-1/2 particle, a rotation of the measurement axis in physical space by an angle $\\theta$ corresponds to a transformation in its state space that involves the angle $\\theta/2$. The final answer must show this half-angle dependence. This rules out option A, which depends on $\\theta$.\n3.  **Normalization:** The total probability of finding the particle in any possible state must be 1. This means the quantum state vector must be normalized to have a length of 1, i.e., the sum of the squared absolute values of its components must be 1. The result $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ satisfies this condition.\n4.  **Eigenvalue Specification:** The problem specifically asks for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Using the other eigenvalue, $-\\hbar/2$, would have resulted in the other, orthogonal eigenvector.\n5.  **Unanimous Reasoning:** The fact that all candidate agents, despite different final letter answers, agreed on the mathematical result $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ gives extremely high confidence in the correctness of this expression. The final task is simply to match this correct expression to the options list provided.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the rigorously derived result **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$** with the given options:\n*   A) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect angular dependence.\n*   B) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect; contains $\\hbar$ and is not normalized.\n*   **C) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))** - **Correct.** This option is a perfect match to the derived result.\n*   D) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect; contains $\\hbar$ and has no angular dependence.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires finding the normalized eigenvector of a spin-1/2 particle's spin operator along a specific direction. An analysis of the provided candidate answers shows a unanimous consensus on the mathematical method.

Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\nThe problem asks for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that corresponds to the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. We must solve the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n*   $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The constant factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ cancels from both sides, leaving a simpler system of linear equations. Using the first row, we get:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n**3. Determine the Eigenvector Components and Normalize**\nWe rearrange the equation to find the relationship between the components $a$ and $b$:\n*   $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta) \\implies \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n*   This expression is simplified using the trigonometric half-angle identities: $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n*   This relationship shows that the eigenvector must be proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The final step is to normalize the vector. The squared norm is $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = 1$.

The definitive answer can be determined by verifying this consensus derivation and matching the result to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Construct the Operator for Spin along direction `n`**\nThe first step is to create the matrix representation for the operator that measures spin along the arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$.\n\n*   **Direction Vector `n`**: The direction is specified to lie in the x-z plane. A unit vector in this plane can be parameterized by a single polar angle $\\theta$ (the angle relative to the +z-axis). The Cartesian components of this unit vector are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   **Spin Operator `P_n`**: The operator is the dot product of the spin operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$.\n*   Since the y-component of $\\vec{n}$ is zero, this simplifies to $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$.\n*   Substituting the given matrix forms for $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 2: Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\nWe must find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that corresponds to the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n*   The eigenvalue equation becomes:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The constant factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ cancels from both sides, leaving a simpler system of linear equations. The top row of the matrix equation gives:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n**Step 3: Determine and Simplify the Eigenvector Components**\nThis step involves algebraic manipulation and trigonometry to find the relationship between the eigenvector components, $a$ and $b$.\n\n*   Rearranging the equation from Step 2 gives $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   The ratio of the components is $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$.\n*   This expression is greatly simplified using the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n    *   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    *   $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n*   Substituting these gives:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n**Step 4: Normalize the Eigenvector**\nThe relationship $\\frac{b}{a} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$ implies that the eigenvector is proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. The final step is to normalize this vector.\n\n*   The squared norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the components: $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n*   Since the norm is already 1, the vector is already normalized.\n*   Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Physical Units:** Eigenvectors representing quantum states are dimensionless vectors in an abstract Hilbert space. They should not contain physical constants with units, such as Planck's constant $\\hbar$. This immediately rules out options **B** and **D** as physically incorrect.\n2.  **Angular Dependence for Spin-1/2:** A fundamental property of spin-1/2 particles (also known as spinors) is that a physical rotation of the measurement axis by an angle $\\theta$ results in a transformation in the state space that depends on the half-angle, $\\theta/2$. Option **A**, which depends on $\\theta$, is incorrect for a spinor state.\n3.  **Normalization:** A quantum state must be a unit vector, as the squared magnitudes of its components represent probabilities that must sum to 1. The derived vector $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ correctly meets this requirement, as shown in Step 4.\n4.  **Trigonometric Simplification:** The correct application of the half-angle identities is the key mathematical step that simplifies the ratio of the eigenvector components into the recognizable and standard form. An error in this step would lead to an incorrect result.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe rigorous mathematical derivation, which aligns with the reasoning of all candidate agents, unambiguously yields $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ as the elements of the normalized eigenvector. Comparing this result to the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect angular dependence.\n*   B) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect; contains $\\hbar$ and is not normalized.\n*   C) **(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))** - **This is a perfect match to the derived result.**\n*   D) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect; contains $\\hbar$ and has no angular dependence.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a clear and unanimous consensus on the correct physical principles and mathematical derivation required to solve the problem.

A definitive answer can be found by synthesizing the common, correct derivation and matching the result to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the eigenvector of a spin-1/2 operator for a specific orientation and eigenvalue. This involves a standard, universally agreed-upon procedure in quantum mechanics.\n\n**Step 1: Construct the Operator in the specified direction `n`**\nThe first step is to create the matrix representation for the operator that measures spin along the arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$.\n*   **Direction Vector ($\\vec{n}$):** Since the direction lies in the x-z plane, a unit vector can be parameterized by a single polar angle $\\theta$ relative to the +z-axis.

We check the sum of the squared magnitudes of the components: $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = 1$. The vector is already normalized.\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are unanimously determined to be **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Physical Units:** An eigenvector represents a quantum state, which is a dimensionless vector in an abstract Hilbert space. Options containing the physical constant $\\hbar$, which has units of angular momentum, are fundamentally incorrect on dimensional grounds.

The final eigenvector must reflect this characteristic dependence. This invalidates option C, which depends on $\\theta$.\n3.  **Normalization:** A quantum state vector must be a unit vector (i.e., have a norm of 1), as the squares of its components represent probabilities that must sum to unity.

The discrepancy in the final letter choices is an artifact of the multiple-choice options being presented in different orders to the various agents. The definitive solution can be found by synthesizing the universally agreed-upon derivation and matching it to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires finding the normalized eigenvector of the spin operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon (a spin-1/2 particle) along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$.\n\n**1. Formulate the Operator in the Direction `n`**\nThe first step is to construct the operator $P_n$ corresponding to a spin measurement along the direction $\\vec{n}$.\n*   **Direction Vector `n`**: The direction $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. It is correctly parameterized by the polar angle $\\theta$ relative to the z-axis. The Cartesian components of this vector are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   **Operator `P_n`**: The operator is the dot product of the spin operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$.\n*   Since $n_y = 0$, the expression simplifies to $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$. Substituting the given matrix representations:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**2. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\nNext, we solve the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. Let the eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The equation is:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The constant factor $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides. Using the top row of the matrix equation gives the linear equation:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$.\n\n**3. Determine and Normalize the Eigenvector**\nThe final step is to find the ratio of the components `a` and `b` and normalize the resulting vector.\n*   Rearranging the equation: $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   This gives the ratio of the components: $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$.\n*   Using the trigonometric half-angle identities ($1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$) is the key to simplification:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n*   This relationship implies the eigenvector is proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   To normalize this vector, we calculate the sum of the squared magnitudes of the components: $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = 1$. Since the result is 1, the vector is already normalized.\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Physical Units:** An eigenvector represents a quantum state, which is a dimensionless vector in an abstract Hilbert space.

The final eigenvector must reflect this half-angle dependence. This invalidates option B, which depends on $\\theta$.\n3.  **Normalization:** A quantum state vector must be normalized to have a length of 1, as the sum of the squared magnitudes of its components corresponds to the total probability. The result `(cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))` satisfies this with $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n4.  **Correct Eigenvalue:** The calculation must be performed for the specified eigenvalue of $+\\hbar/2$.
