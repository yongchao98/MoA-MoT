Deconstruction of the Problem and Key Principles**\n\nThe task is to find the minimum spatial resolution of a detector ($d_{res}$) that is needed to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a high-energy particle, $X^0$. This problem requires the application of two core principles of modern physics:\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is significantly larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), indicating it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic equations to correctly describe its motion, momentum, and decay characteristics in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random, statistical process. The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is described by the survival function $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where `λ` is the particle's mean decay length in the observer's frame of reference.\n\n### **2. Formulating the Mathematical Condition**\n\nThe phrase \"observe a decay\" for a neutral particle implies that the particle must travel a distance from its creation point that is large enough to be resolved as separate from the decay point. This means the particle's travel distance must be greater than the detector's resolution, i.e., `distance > d_res`.\n\nTo observe \"at least 30%\" of the decays, the probability for this to happen must be equal to 0.30. We use this boundary condition to find the minimum required resolution:\n$$P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nSolving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm gives:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nTo solve for $d_{res}$, we must first calculate the mean decay length, `λ`, in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum (`pc`)**\n    The most accurate method uses the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**\n    The formula that relates the lab-frame mean decay length to the proper lifetime is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    Using the given values ($\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s and $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s):\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$)**\n    Now we substitute the value of `λ` into our primary equation:\n    $d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **4. Analysis of Results and Careful Points**\n\nThis section is crucial for selecting the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Order of Magnitude Check**\n    The calculated resolution based on a literal reading of \"30%\" is approximately **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **D**. All other options are incorrect by factors of 1000 or more, making D the only physically plausible choice.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**\n    The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the value in option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. This discrepancy is a strong hint that the problem was designed with a more fundamental fraction in mind. It is a very common practice in physics multiple-choice questions for a round percentage like \"30%\" to be an approximation for a simpler fraction, most likely **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$). Let's test this well-founded hypothesis:\n    *   The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   $d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (\\ln(3)) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986)$\n    *   $d_{res} \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Final Confirmation**\n    This refined result, **$2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for the value in option D, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. The difference is less than 0.5%, which is easily attributable to the rounding of constants. This provides overwhelming evidence that the problem was designed around a 1/3 probability and that D is the intended answer. Both the direct calculation (which identifies the correct order of magnitude) and the refined analysis (which gives an almost perfect numerical match) lead to the same conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and a verification of the underlying physics, the following is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem requires us to find the minimum detector resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a relativistic particle. The solution path involves combining the principles of special relativity with the statistical laws of particle decay. All the provided candidate answers correctly identify and follow these core steps.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**\n\nFirst, we must define what it means to \"observe\" the decay of a neutral particle. Since the `X^0` particle leaves no track, its decay is observed only if it travels a distance `d` from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve as distinct from the decay point where the charged `Y^+` and `Z^-` appear.\n*   This translates to the condition: particle travel distance, `d`, must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n*   Particle decay is a probabilistic process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `d` or greater is given by:\n    $P(\\text{travel\\_distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of the decays. To find the minimum resolution that achieves this, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n*   Solving for `d_res` by taking the natural logarithm yields:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ) in the Lab Frame**\n\nThe particle's total energy (`E` = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (`m₀c²` = 3.41 GeV), indicating it is highly relativistic. We must calculate its mean decay length in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum (`pc`)**: The most robust method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m₀c²)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**: The formula relating the lab-frame decay length to the proper lifetime (`τ₀`) and momentum is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m₀c²} \\cdot cτ₀$.\n    $ \\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $ \\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$) and Analyze**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into the equation from Step 1.\n$d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$d_{res} \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis calculated result (`2.27e-6 m`) is numerically closest to the value `2.08e-6 m`. Checking the provided options:\nA) 2.08*1e-1 m\nB) 2.08*1e-3 m\nC) 2.08*1e-6 m\nD) 2.08*1e-9 m\nOur calculation clearly points to **Option C** as it is the only one with the correct order of magnitude.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\nA thorough analysis, as synthesized from the candidates, reveals several critical points:\n\n1.  **Correct Physics Model**: The translation of \"observing a decay\" into the statistical survival condition, $P(d > d_{res})$, is the foundational step. Any deterministic calculation would be incorrect.\n2.  **Robust Relativistic Calculation**: Using the momentum-based formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$ is the most accurate way to account for relativistic effects, avoiding potential rounding errors from calculating the Lorentz factor `γ` and velocity `v` separately.\n3.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**: This is a crucial point of interpretation identified by all the competent candidate answers. The calculated value based on a literal 30% ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the option C value ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. This discrepancy is a strong hint that the problem was designed using a simpler fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended survival probability was **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$).\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for `d_res` gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n        $d_{res} \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n4.  **Final Conclusion**: This refined result, **$2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for option C, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides overwhelmingly strong evidence that C is the intended answer and that the \"1/3 hypothesis\" was the intended interpretation for the question's design. The minor remaining difference is easily attributable to the rounding of the initial constants provided in the problem statement.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on an analysis of the provided candidate solutions and the underlying physics, here is a consolidated step-by-step breakdown of the problem.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a relativistic particle, $X^0$. This is a multi-step problem that requires combining concepts from special relativity with the statistical laws of particle decay. All candidate answers correctly identify the same fundamental approach.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1.  **Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**:\n    A decay is \"observed\" if the neutral particle ($X^0$) travels a distance `d` from its creation point that is large enough to be resolved by the detector. This means the travel distance must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`. The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance of at least `d_res` is:\n    $$P(d \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame. The problem asks to observe \"at least 30%\" of decays, so we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\n    Solving for `d_res` gives: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**:\n    The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must calculate its mean decay length in the lab frame.\n    *   **Calculate Momentum (`pc`)**: The most accurate method is using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   **Calculate Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: The formula relating lab-frame decay length to proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) and momentum is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n        $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**:\n    Substituting the value of $\\lambda$ back into the equation from Step 1 gives:\n    $d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Decision**\n\n1.  **Correct Physics Model**: The problem is statistical, not deterministic. Correctly identifying the exponential decay law $P(d \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$ as the governing principle is the crucial first step.\n2.  **Relativistic Calculation**: The particle is highly relativistic, making the use of the energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$ essential for accuracy. Non-relativistic calculations would be completely wrong.\n3.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**: This is a key insight identified by all competent analyses. The calculated value from a literal 30% ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is numerically close to one of the options but does not match perfectly. In multiple-choice physics problems, round percentages are often approximations for simpler fractions. Testing the hypothesis that \"30%\" was an approximation for a survival probability of **1/3** gives:\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   $d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n4.  **Comparison with Options**: This refined result, **$2.070 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an almost perfect match for option **D) 2.08\\*1e-6 m**. The difference is less than 0.5%, providing overwhelming evidence that this was the intended interpretation for the question.\n5.  **Order of Magnitude Check**: Even without the refined \"1/3\" hypothesis, the initial calculation ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) correctly identifies that the answer must have an order of magnitude of $10^{-6}$. This immediately eliminates options A, B, and C, making D the only plausible answer.\n\nBoth the direct calculation and the more refined analysis conclusively identify D as the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a synthesis of the candidate answers, a definitive solution can be reached by following a clear, step-by-step physical and mathematical reasoning process. The candidate answers, despite some inconsistencies in their final letter choice due to different option lists, are remarkably consistent in their scientific approach.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**\n\nThe core of the problem is to understand what it means to \"observe\" the decay of a neutral particle like $X^0$. Since the neutral particle leaves no track in a bubble chamber, its decay is considered \"observed\" only if it travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough to be distinguished from the decay point (where the charged tracks of $Y^+$ and $Z^-$ appear). This means the particle's travel distance, `d`, must be greater than the detector's spatial resolution, `d_res`.\n\nThis is a probabilistic process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` (in the laboratory frame) will travel a distance of at least `d_res` is given by the survival function:\n$$P(distance \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\nThe problem requires this for \"at least 30%\" of the decays. To find the minimum resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nSolving for `d_res` gives:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nThe particle is highly relativistic, as its total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV). Therefore, we must use relativistic kinematics to find its mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum (`pc`)**: This is accurately found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**: The mean decay length in the lab frame is time-dilated. It is most accurately calculated using the formula that incorporates momentum: $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    $$\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$$\n    $$\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution (d_res) and Analyze**\n\nNow we substitute the calculated value of `λ` back into the equation from Step 1.\n$$d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\nLet's compare this result to the given options.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Order of Magnitude Check**: Our calculation using a literal interpretation of \"30%\" gives a result of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The options provided are:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **C**. All other options are off by factors of thousands or more, making them physically incorrect. This alone strongly suggests C is the correct answer.\n\n2.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**: This is a crucial point of interpretation that the vast majority of candidate answers correctly identified. There is a ~9% discrepancy between the calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the value in option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). In multiple-choice physics questions, it is very common for a round percentage like \"30%\" to be an approximation of a simpler, more fundamental fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the problem was designed for a survival probability of **1/3** (~33.3%).\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for `d_res` gives: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n        $$d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$$\n\n3.  **Final Conclusion**: This refined result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an excellent match for option **C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended method for designing the question's answers. Both the direct calculation (which identifies the correct order of magnitude) and the refined calculation (which gives a near-perfect numerical match) conclusively point to C as the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying the crucial points.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a relativistic particle, $X^0$. A successful solution requires a correct interpretation of the physical scenario and a precise application of principles from special relativity and particle statistics. All the successful candidate answers follow the same logical steps.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding what it means to \"observe\" the decay of a neutral particle. Since the $X^0$ particle is neutral, it leaves no track in the bubble chamber. Its decay is considered observed only if it travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve as distinct from the decay point where the charged products ($Y^+$, $Z^-$) appear.\n\n*   This means the particle's travel distance, `d`, must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n*   The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `d` or greater is given by the survival function:\n    $$P(\\text{travel distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of the decays.

Since the $X^0$ particle leaves no track, its decay is observed only if it travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve as distinct from the decay point.\n\n*   This means the particle's travel distance, `d`, must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n*   Particle decay is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `d` or greater is given by:\n    $P(\\text{travel distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   To observe \"at least 30%\" of the decays, we must find the minimum resolution that satisfies the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n*   Solving for `d_res` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must calculate its mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$)**: The most accurate method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**: The lab-frame mean decay length is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    Using the speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s and the given proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s:\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Resolution and Compare with Options**\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into the equation from Step 1.\nUsing the literal \"30%\" value: $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nComparing this value to the options, we see it is closest to **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. All other options have the wrong order of magnitude by a factor of 1000 or more, making them physically impossible.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\nA thorough analysis reveals several crucial points that are key to selecting the correct answer with confidence.\n\n1.  **Correct Physics Model**: It is vital to interpret \"observing a decay\" as the particle traveling a distance *greater* than the resolution, leading to the use of the survival function $e^{-x/\\lambda} = P$. This was identified correctly by all competent candidate answers.\n2.  **Robust Relativistic Calculation**: Using the energy-momentum relation to find `pc` first, and then applying it in the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$, is the most robust way to account for relativistic effects, avoiding potential rounding errors from calculating the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ and velocity $v$ separately.\n3.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**: This is the most critical insight for achieving a precise match. The direct calculation gives $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which differs from the option value of $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m by ~9%. In multiple-choice physics questions, it is common for a round percentage like \"30%\" to be an approximation for a simpler fraction. Testing the hypothesis that the problem intended a survival probability of **1/3** (~33.3%):\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   Calculation: $d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$.\n    This refined result is an almost perfect match (less than 0.5% difference) for the option value of $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, confirming it is the intended answer.\n4.  **Option List Consistency**: The candidate answers showed confusion over the correct letter (A, B, C, or D). This is because the option list was not the same for all agents. Based on the option list provided in this specific problem prompt, the value **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m** corresponds to option **C**.\n\nBoth the direct calculation (which identifies the correct order of magnitude) and the more refined calculation (which provides an excellent numerical match) conclusively identify $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m as the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying the most crucial points.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Physical Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **The \"Observation\" Condition:** The initial particle $X^0$ is neutral, so it does not leave a track. Its decay products, $Y^+$ and $Z^-$, are charged and do leave tracks. An \"observed\" decay requires that the neutral particle travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve it as distinct from the decay point. This means the particle's travel distance, `d`, must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n\n*   **The Probability Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance of `d` or more is given by:\n    $P(\\text{travel distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   **The Mathematical Formulation:** The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of the decays. To find the minimum required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Solving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm yields:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### **2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nThe particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), meaning it is highly relativistic. We must calculate its mean decay length in the laboratory frame using relativistic kinematics.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$):** The most precise method uses the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$):** The formula relating lab-frame decay length to proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) and momentum is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    *   Using $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s and $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s:\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3. Calculation of the Final Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into the equation from Step 1.\n*   Using the literal \"30%\":\n    $d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **4. Careful Points and Final Decision**\n\n1.  **Order of Magnitude Check:** The calculated resolution is $\\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. We compare this to the options provided in the question:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **B**. The others are incorrect by factors of thousands or more. This alone makes B the only plausible answer.\n\n2.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis:** A key insight, identified by a strong consensus among the candidate answers, addresses the ~9% difference between the calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the option value ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). In physics exam questions, round percentages like \"30%\" are often approximations for simpler, more fundamental fractions. Testing the hypothesis that the problem intended a survival probability of **1/3** (~33.3%) is warranted.\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   $d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n\n3.  **Final Conclusion:** This refined result, $2.070 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an excellent match for option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, with a discrepancy of less than 1%. This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended interpretation for designing the question's answer choices. The small remaining difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's given constants. Both the direct calculation (which points to the correct option by order of magnitude) and the refined calculation (which gives a near-perfect numerical match) conclusively identify B as the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires combining principles of special relativity with the statistical nature of particle decay to find a detector's minimum resolution. The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the correct physical reasoning and calculation steps. Here is a synthesized analysis.\n\n### **Analysis of the Physical Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum spatial resolution ($d_{res}$) a detector needs to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the high-energy particle $X^0$.\n\n1.  **The Observation Condition:** The initial particle $X^0$ is neutral, so it does not leave a track. Its decay is considered \"observed\" only if its charged decay products ($Y^+$ and $Z^-$) appear at a location that is distinguishably separate from the particle's creation point. For this to happen, the neutral particle must travel a distance `x` that is *greater* than the detector's resolution ($x > d_{res}$) before it decays.\n\n2.  **Core Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` (in the laboratory frame) will travel a distance `x` or more is given by the survival function: $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n    *   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), indicating it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic formulas to find its decay length in the lab frame.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Mathematical Condition**\nTo find the minimum resolution for observing *at least* 30% of decays, we solve for the boundary condition where the probability is exactly 30% (0.30):\n$P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nBy taking the natural logarithm and rearranging, we solve for $d_{res}$:\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nWe first need the mean decay length of the particle in the lab frame, which is dilated due to relativistic effects.\n\n1.  **Find the particle's momentum ($pc$)**: The most robust method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2}$\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate $\\lambda$**: The lab-frame mean decay length is related to the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ and momentum by the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    *   Using $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s and $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s:\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    *   $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nNow, we substitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into our equation from Step 1.\n*   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Decision**\n\n1.  **Order of Magnitude Check:** The calculation based on a literal reading of \"30%\" gives a result of approximately **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. Comparing this with the options:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **D**.

This alone strongly suggests D is the answer.\n\n2.  **The \"1/3 Hypothesis\":** The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the value in option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. As noted by a strong consensus among the candidate answers, this discrepancy is a common clue in multiple-choice physics questions. The round percentage \"30%\" is often an approximation for a simpler, fundamental fraction to allow for cleaner numbers in the answer choices. The most likely candidate fraction is **1/3** (~33.3%). Let's test this hypothesis:\n    *   The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   Recalculating with this more precise condition:\n        $d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\bf{2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n\n3.  **Final Confirmation:** This refined result, **$2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an almost perfect match for option **D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides overwhelming evidence that this was the intended interpretation for the question.

Deconstruction of the Physical Problem**\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. This problem requires a combination of principles from special relativity and the statistical laws of particle decay.\n\n### **2. Core Physical Principles and Formulation**\n\n**A. The Observation Condition**\nA neutral particle, $X^0$, does not leave a track. Its decay is considered \"observed\" only if it travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to distinguish it from the decay point, where the charged products ($Y^+$ and $Z^-$) appear. This means the particle's travel distance must be greater than the detector's resolution.\n$$ \\text{Travel Distance} > d_{res} $$\n\n**B. The Exponential Decay Law**\nThe decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length $\\lambda$ will travel a distance of at least $d_{res}$ is given by the survival function:\n$$ P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} $$\nThe problem requires this probability to be at least 30% (0.30).

Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nTo find $d_{res}$, we must first calculate the mean decay length in the laboratory frame, $\\lambda$.\n\n**Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$)**\nThe particle is highly relativistic since its total energy ($E=27$ GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV). The most robust way to handle the relativistic kinematics is to use the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n*   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n*   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame is dilated and can be accurately calculated using the formula: $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n\n*   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n*   $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nNow we substitute the value of $\\lambda$ into our formula. A direct calculation based on the literal \"30%\" condition gives:\n\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n*   $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **4.

Since the $X^0$ particle is neutral, it leaves no track. A decay is considered \"observed\" only if the particle travels a distance from its creation point that is *greater* than the detector's resolution, allowing the creation and decay points to be distinguished. This is a statistical process governed by the exponential decay law.

Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to observe at least 30% of particle decays. The key steps are:\n*   **Defining Observation**: The initial particle $X^0$ is neutral and leaves no track. Its decay is \"observed\" only if it travels a distance `d` from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve as distinct from the decay point where the charged products appear. This means the condition for an observed decay is `d > d_res`.\n*   **Applying the Decay Law**: Particle decay is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` (in the laboratory frame) will travel a distance `d` or greater is:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n*   **Setting the Boundary Condition**: To find the minimum resolution for observing \"at least 30%\" of decays, we solve for the boundary case where the probability is exactly 30% (or 0.30):\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Solving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm yields:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**2. Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nThe particle is highly relativistic, as its total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV). Therefore, we must use relativistic kinematics to find its mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   **Calculate Momentum ($pc$)**: The most accurate method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$:\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   **Calculate Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: The lab-frame mean decay length is related to the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ and momentum by the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$:\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**3. Calculate the Resolution ($d_{res}$) and Analyze the Options**\n\nSubstituting the calculated value of $\\lambda$ into the equation from Step 1 gives:\n$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is numerically closest to the option **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, and is the only option with the correct order of magnitude. This alone strongly suggests the correct option.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Observing a Decay\"**: It is crucial to translate this phrase into the correct statistical condition: the probability that the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution, or $P(d > d_{res})$.\n2.  **Robust Relativistic Calculation**: Using the relativistic momentum `pc` in the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$ is the most direct and accurate method. It avoids calculating the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ and velocity $v$ separately, thus minimizing potential intermediate rounding errors.\n3.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**: This is the most important insight for confirming the correct answer. The calculated value based on a literal \"30%\" ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the option value ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. As noted by all the candidate analyses, this suggests the \"30%\" was intended as a convenient approximation for a simpler fraction, most likely **1/3** (~33.3%). Let's test this refined hypothesis:\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    *   This gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n    *   Recalculating: $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (\\ln(3)) \\approx \\mathbf{2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n4.  **Final Confirmation**: This result, $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an excellent match for the option value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m (a difference of less than 0.5%). This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended method for designing the problem's answer choices. Both the direct calculation (which points to the correct option by order of magnitude) and this refined calculation (which gives a near-perfect numerical match) point to the same answer.\n\nBased on the list of options provided in the question:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n\nThe correct numerical value is found in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying the most critical points.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a high-energy particle, $X^0$. The solution requires a two-part process: first, using special relativity to determine the particle's properties in the lab frame, and second, applying the statistical laws of particle decay to find the required resolution.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1.  **Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**:\n    *   A neutral particle like $X^0$ leaves no track. Its decay is \"observed\" only if it travels a distance `d` from its creation point that is greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`. This allows the creation and decay events to be seen as two distinct points.\n    *   The decay of particles is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` (in the laboratory frame) will travel a distance `d` or greater is given by the survival function:\n        $$P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\n    *   To observe \"at least 30%\" of decays, we set up the boundary condition:\n        $$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\n    *   Solving for `d_res` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:\n        $$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**:\n    *   The particle is highly relativistic since its total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV).

Using $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n        $$d_{res} \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider and Final Decision**\n\n1.  **Order of Magnitude Check**: The direct calculation gives a resolution of approximately **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. Comparing this with the options:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n\n    Only option **D** has the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$). The others are incorrect by factors of thousands or more, making D the only plausible answer.\n\n2.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**: This is a critical point identified by all thorough analyses. The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the value in option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. In multiple-choice physics problems, it is common for a round percentage like \"30%\" to be an approximation of a simpler, more fundamental fraction.

Deconstruction of the Physical Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Observation Condition:** An \"observed\" decay requires that the neutral particle ($X^0$) travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to distinguish it from the decay point where the charged products ($Y^+$, $Z^-$) appear. This means the particle's travel distance, `d`, must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n\n*   **Physics Principles:** The solution relies on two key areas of physics:\n    1.  **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy ($E=27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic. Relativistic equations are necessary to describe its motion and decay in the laboratory frame.\n    2.  **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a probabilistic process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance of at least `d` before decaying is given by the survival function: $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, where `λ` is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### **2. Formulation and Calculation Steps**\n\nThe agents consistently followed these steps:\n\n**Step A: Set up the Mathematical Condition for Resolution.**\nTo observe \"at least 30%\" of decays, we must find the minimum resolution $d_{res}$ that satisfies the boundary condition:\n$$P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nSolving for $d_{res}$ yields:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ) in the Lab Frame.**\nThis requires using relativistic kinematics.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$):** The most accurate method uses the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length (λ):** The formula relating the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) to the lab-frame mean decay length ($\\lambda$) via momentum is:\n    *   $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    *   $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nSubstitute the calculated value of `λ` into the equation from Step A.\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n*   $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3.

All provided candidate answers correctly identify the same general methodology. The following is a synthesized analysis of the solution, including all critical steps and careful points.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**\n    The core of the problem lies in translating \"observe at least 30% of the decays\" into a physical condition. A neutral particle, $X^0$, leaves no track, so its decay is only \"observed\" if it travels a distance `d` from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve. This means the particle's travel distance must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n\n    Particle decay is a statistical process. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `d` or greater is given by the exponential decay law:\n    $$P(travel\\_distance \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$$\n    where `λ` is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame. To find the *minimum* resolution to observe *at least* 30% of the decays, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\n    Solving for `d_res` gives:\n    $$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n    The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic.

Using $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s and $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s:\n        $$ \\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Minimum Resolution and Analyze Results**\n    Substituting the value of `λ` back into the equation from Step 1 and using $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n    $$d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n    This direct calculation yields a result of approximately **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. This value is very close to the option `2.08*1e-6 m`, and has the correct order of magnitude, making it the only plausible answer.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** The crucial first step is to correctly interpret \"observing a decay\" as a statistical condition where the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector resolution, modeled by the exponential survival function $e^{-d/\\lambda}$.\n\n*   **Robust Relativistic Calculation:** Using the energy-momentum relation to find `pc` first, and then using that to calculate the mean decay length `λ`, is the most accurate method that avoids potential intermediate rounding errors from calculating velocity and the Lorentz factor separately.\n\n*   **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis:** This is the key insight identified by all the candidate answers.

Physical Interpretation of the Question**\n\nThe central task is to find the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the neutral particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The \"Observation\" Condition.** Since the $X^0$ particle is neutral, it leaves no track. A decay is considered \"observed\" only if the particle travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector's resolution to distinguish it from the decay point (where the charged products $Y^+$ and $Z^-$ appear). Therefore, the particle must travel a distance `d` that is **greater** than the resolution `d_res`.\n\n*   **The Exponential Decay Law**: Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` will travel a distance of at least `d_res` is described by the survival function:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n\n*   **Mathematical Formulation**: To observe \"at least 30%\" of decays, we set up the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Solving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm gives:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### **2.

    "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, all of which converge on the same physical reasoning and numerical result, here is a consolidated step-by-step solution.\n\n### **1. Physical Interpretation and Formulation**\n\nThe first step is to correctly interpret the physical situation. The question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) needed to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the neutral particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Observation Condition**: Since $X^0$ is neutral, it leaves no track. A decay is considered \"observed\" only if the particle travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough to be resolved by the detector. This means the particle's travel distance, `d`, must be *greater* than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n*   **Statistical Law**: Particle decay is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle will survive to travel a distance of at least `d_res` is given by the survival function:\n    $$ P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} $$\n    where `λ` is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Mathematical Condition**: The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of the decays. To find the minimum resolution that achieves this, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $$ e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30 $$\n    By taking the natural logarithm, we can solve for $d_{res}$:\n    $$ d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) $$\n\n### **2. Relativistic Kinematics and Calculation**\n\nThe particle is highly relativistic ($E=27$ GeV >> $m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV), so we must use relativistic formulas to find its mean decay length `λ` in the lab frame.\n\nFirst, let's perform the calculation precisely using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nE_total = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the particle's momentum (pc)\n# E_total^2 = (pc)^2 + (m0c2)^2\npc = math.sqrt(E_total**2 - m0c2**2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame\n# lambda = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\nmean_decay_length = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the required resolution (d_res)\n# We test two hypotheses for \"at least 30%\"\n\n# Hypothesis A: Literal 30% (0.30)\n# d_res = -lambda * ln(0.30)\nresolution_30_percent = -mean_decay_length * math.log(0.30)\n\n# Hypothesis B: \"30%\" is an approximation for 1/3\n# d_res = -lambda * ln(1/3) = lambda * ln(3)\nresolution_1_3 = mean_decay_length * math.log(3)\n\nprint(f\"Momentum pc = {pc:.3f} GeV/c\")\nprint(f\"Mean decay length lambda = {mean_decay_length:.3e} m\")\nprint(f\"Resolution for P=0.30 is {resolution_30_percent:.3e} m\")\nprint(f\"Resolution for P=1/3 is {resolution_1_3:.3e} m\")\n```\nMomentum pc = 26.784 GeV/c\nMean decay length lambda = 1.884e-06 m\nResolution for P=0.30 is 2.268e-06 m\nResolution for P=1/3 is 2.070e-06 m\n\n### **3. Analysis of Results and Careful Points**\n\nThe unanimous conclusion across all candidate solutions is based on the following key points of analysis:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Order of Magnitude Check.** The direct calculation using a literal 30% survival rate gives a required resolution of $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Looking at the provided options:\n    A) 2.08*1e-9 m\n    B) 2.08*1e-6 m\n    C) 2.08*1e-1 m\n    D) 2.08*1e-3 m\n    Only option **B** has the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$). The others are off by factors of 1000 or more, making them physically impossible. This check alone is sufficient to strongly suggest B is the correct answer.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis.** There is a noticeable discrepancy of about 9% between the direct calculation ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the value in option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). A key insight, correctly identified by all the candidate answers, is that in exam-style physics problems, a round percentage like \"30%\" is often a convenient approximation for a simpler, more fundamental fraction. The most likely fraction in this context is **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$).\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Final Confirmation.** Testing the \"1/3 hypothesis\" yields a required resolution of $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx \\mathbf{2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$. This refined result is an almost perfect match for the value in option B, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$**, with a difference of less than 1%. This provides overwhelming evidence that B is the intended answer and this was the intended method for designing the problem's answer choices.\n\nBoth the direct calculation (which identifies the correct option by its order of magnitude) and the more refined \"1/3 hypothesis\" calculation (which provides an almost exact numerical match) conclusively point to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

Deconstruction of the Problem and Key Principles**\n\nThe task is to find the minimum spatial resolution of a detector ($d_{res}$) that is needed to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a high-energy particle, $X^0$. This problem requires the application of two core principles of modern physics:\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is significantly larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), indicating it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic equations to correctly describe its motion, momentum, and decay characteristics in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random, statistical process. The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is described by the survival function $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where `λ` is the particle's mean decay length in the observer's frame of reference.\n\n### **2. Formulating the Mathematical Condition**\n\nThe phrase \"observe a decay\" for a neutral particle implies that the particle must travel a distance from its creation point that is large enough to be resolved as separate from the decay point. This means the particle's travel distance must be greater than the detector's resolution, i.e., `distance > d_res`.\n\nTo observe \"at least 30%\" of the decays, the probability for this to happen must be equal to 0.30. We use this boundary condition to find the minimum required resolution:\n$$P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nSolving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm gives:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nTo solve for $d_{res}$, we must first calculate the mean decay length, `λ`, in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum (`pc`)**\n    The most accurate method uses the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**\n    The formula that relates the lab-frame mean decay length to the proper lifetime is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    Using the given values ($\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s and $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s):\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$)**\n    Now we substitute the value of `λ` into our primary equation:\n    $d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **4. Analysis of Results and Careful Points**\n\nThis section is crucial for selecting the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Order of Magnitude Check**\n    The calculated resolution based on a literal reading of \"30%\" is approximately **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **D**. All other options are incorrect by factors of 1000 or more, making D the only physically plausible choice.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**\n    The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the value in option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. This discrepancy is a strong hint that the problem was designed with a more fundamental fraction in mind. It is a very common practice in physics multiple-choice questions for a round percentage like \"30%\" to be an approximation for a simpler fraction, most likely **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$). Let's test this well-founded hypothesis:\n    *   The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   $d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (\\ln(3)) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986)$\n    *   $d_{res} \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Final Confirmation**\n    This refined result, **$2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for the value in option D, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. The difference is less than 0.5%, which is easily attributable to the rounding of constants. This provides overwhelming evidence that the problem was designed around a 1/3 probability and that D is the intended answer. Both the direct calculation (which identifies the correct order of magnitude) and the refined analysis (which gives an almost perfect numerical match) lead to the same conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and a verification of the underlying physics, the following is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem requires us to find the minimum detector resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a relativistic particle. The solution path involves combining the principles of special relativity with the statistical laws of particle decay. All the provided candidate answers correctly identify and follow these core steps.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**\n\nFirst, we must define what it means to \"observe\" the decay of a neutral particle. Since the `X^0` particle leaves no track, its decay is observed only if it travels a distance `d` from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve as distinct from the decay point where the charged `Y^+` and `Z^-` appear.\n*   This translates to the condition: particle travel distance, `d`, must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n*   Particle decay is a probabilistic process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `d` or greater is given by:\n    $P(\\text{travel\\_distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of the decays. To find the minimum resolution that achieves this, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n*   Solving for `d_res` by taking the natural logarithm yields:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ) in the Lab Frame**\n\nThe particle's total energy (`E` = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (`m₀c²` = 3.41 GeV), indicating it is highly relativistic. We must calculate its mean decay length in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum (`pc`)**: The most robust method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m₀c²)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**: The formula relating the lab-frame decay length to the proper lifetime (`τ₀`) and momentum is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m₀c²} \\cdot cτ₀$.\n    $ \\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $ \\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$) and Analyze**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into the equation from Step 1.\n$d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$d_{res} \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis calculated result (`2.27e-6 m`) is numerically closest to the value `2.08e-6 m`. Checking the provided options:\nA) 2.08*1e-1 m\nB) 2.08*1e-3 m\nC) 2.08*1e-6 m\nD) 2.08*1e-9 m\nOur calculation clearly points to **Option C** as it is the only one with the correct order of magnitude.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\nA thorough analysis, as synthesized from the candidates, reveals several critical points:\n\n1.  **Correct Physics Model**: The translation of \"observing a decay\" into the statistical survival condition, $P(d > d_{res})$, is the foundational step. Any deterministic calculation would be incorrect.\n2.  **Robust Relativistic Calculation**: Using the momentum-based formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$ is the most accurate way to account for relativistic effects, avoiding potential rounding errors from calculating the Lorentz factor `γ` and velocity `v` separately.\n3.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**: This is a crucial point of interpretation identified by all the competent candidate answers. The calculated value based on a literal 30% ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the option C value ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. This discrepancy is a strong hint that the problem was designed using a simpler fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended survival probability was **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$).\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for `d_res` gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n        $d_{res} \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n4.  **Final Conclusion**: This refined result, **$2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for option C, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides overwhelmingly strong evidence that C is the intended answer and that the \"1/3 hypothesis\" was the intended interpretation for the question's design. The minor remaining difference is easily attributable to the rounding of the initial constants provided in the problem statement.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on an analysis of the provided candidate solutions and the underlying physics, here is a consolidated step-by-step breakdown of the problem.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a relativistic particle, $X^0$. This is a multi-step problem that requires combining concepts from special relativity with the statistical laws of particle decay. All candidate answers correctly identify the same fundamental approach.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1.  **Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**:\n    A decay is \"observed\" if the neutral particle ($X^0$) travels a distance `d` from its creation point that is large enough to be resolved by the detector. This means the travel distance must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`. The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance of at least `d_res` is:\n    $$P(d \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame. The problem asks to observe \"at least 30%\" of decays, so we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\n    Solving for `d_res` gives: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**:\n    The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic.

The candidate answers, despite some inconsistencies in their final letter choice due to different option lists, are remarkably consistent in their scientific approach.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**\n\nThe core of the problem is to understand what it means to \"observe\" the decay of a neutral particle like $X^0$. Since the neutral particle leaves no track in a bubble chamber, its decay is considered \"observed\" only if it travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough to be distinguished from the decay point (where the charged tracks of $Y^+$ and $Z^-$ appear). This means the particle's travel distance, `d`, must be greater than the detector's spatial resolution, `d_res`.\n\nThis is a probabilistic process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` (in the laboratory frame) will travel a distance of at least `d_res` is given by the survival function:\n$$P(distance \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\nThe problem requires this for \"at least 30%\" of the decays. To find the minimum resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nSolving for `d_res` gives:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nThe particle is highly relativistic, as its total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV). Therefore, we must use relativistic kinematics to find its mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum (`pc`)**: This is accurately found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**: The mean decay length in the lab frame is time-dilated. It is most accurately calculated using the formula that incorporates momentum: $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    $$\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$$\n    $$\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution (d_res) and Analyze**\n\nNow we substitute the calculated value of `λ` back into the equation from Step 1.\n$$d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\nLet's compare this result to the given options.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Order of Magnitude Check**: Our calculation using a literal interpretation of \"30%\" gives a result of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The options provided are:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **C**. All other options are off by factors of thousands or more, making them physically incorrect. This alone strongly suggests C is the correct answer.\n\n2.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**: This is a crucial point of interpretation that the vast majority of candidate answers correctly identified. There is a ~9% discrepancy between the calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the value in option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). In multiple-choice physics questions, it is very common for a round percentage like \"30%\" to be an approximation of a simpler, more fundamental fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the problem was designed for a survival probability of **1/3** (~33.3%).\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for `d_res` gives: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n        $$d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$$\n\n3.  **Final Conclusion**: This refined result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an excellent match for option **C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended method for designing the question's answers.

Since the $X^0$ particle leaves no track, its decay is observed only if it travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve as distinct from the decay point.\n\n*   This means the particle's travel distance, `d`, must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n*   Particle decay is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `d` or greater is given by:\n    $P(\\text{travel distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   To observe \"at least 30%\" of the decays, we must find the minimum resolution that satisfies the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n*   Solving for `d_res` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic.

This was identified correctly by all competent candidate answers.\n2.  **Robust Relativistic Calculation**: Using the energy-momentum relation to find `pc` first, and then applying it in the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$, is the most robust way to account for relativistic effects, avoiding potential rounding errors from calculating the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ and velocity $v$ separately.\n3.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**: This is the most critical insight for achieving a precise match. The direct calculation gives $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which differs from the option value of $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m by ~9%. In multiple-choice physics questions, it is common for a round percentage like \"30%\" to be an approximation for a simpler fraction. Testing the hypothesis that the problem intended a survival probability of **1/3** (~33.3%):\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   Calculation: $d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$.\n    This refined result is an almost perfect match (less than 0.5% difference) for the option value of $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, confirming it is the intended answer.\n4.  **Option List Consistency**: The candidate answers showed confusion over the correct letter (A, B, C, or D).

Deconstruction of the Physical Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **The \"Observation\" Condition:** The initial particle $X^0$ is neutral, so it does not leave a track. Its decay products, $Y^+$ and $Z^-$, are charged and do leave tracks. An \"observed\" decay requires that the neutral particle travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve it as distinct from the decay point. This means the particle's travel distance, `d`, must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n\n*   **The Probability Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance of `d` or more is given by:\n    $P(\\text{travel distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   **The Mathematical Formulation:** The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of the decays. To find the minimum required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Solving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm yields:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### **2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nThe particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), meaning it is highly relativistic. We must calculate its mean decay length in the laboratory frame using relativistic kinematics.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$):** The most precise method uses the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$):** The formula relating lab-frame decay length to proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) and momentum is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    *   Using $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s and $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s:\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3.

We compare this to the options provided in the question:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **B**.

This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended interpretation for designing the question's answer choices. The small remaining difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's given constants. Both the direct calculation (which points to the correct option by order of magnitude) and the refined calculation (which gives a near-perfect numerical match) conclusively identify B as the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires combining principles of special relativity with the statistical nature of particle decay to find a detector's minimum resolution. The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the correct physical reasoning and calculation steps. Here is a synthesized analysis.\n\n### **Analysis of the Physical Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum spatial resolution ($d_{res}$) a detector needs to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the high-energy particle $X^0$.\n\n1.  **The Observation Condition:** The initial particle $X^0$ is neutral, so it does not leave a track. Its decay is considered \"observed\" only if its charged decay products ($Y^+$ and $Z^-$) appear at a location that is distinguishably separate from the particle's creation point.

Deconstruction of the Physical Problem**\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. This problem requires a combination of principles from special relativity and the statistical laws of particle decay.\n\n### **2. Core Physical Principles and Formulation**\n\n**A. The Observation Condition**\nA neutral particle, $X^0$, does not leave a track. Its decay is considered \"observed\" only if it travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to distinguish it from the decay point, where the charged products ($Y^+$ and $Z^-$) appear. This means the particle's travel distance must be greater than the detector's resolution.\n$$ \\text{Travel Distance} > d_{res} $$\n\n**B. The Exponential Decay Law**\nThe decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length $\\lambda$ will travel a distance of at least $d_{res}$ is given by the survival function:\n$$ P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} $$\nThe problem requires this probability to be at least 30% (0.30). To find the minimum resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$$ e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30 $$\nBy taking the natural logarithm and rearranging, we solve for $d_{res}$:\n$$ d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) $$\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nTo find $d_{res}$, we must first calculate the mean decay length in the laboratory frame, $\\lambda$.\n\n**Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$)**\nThe particle is highly relativistic since its total energy ($E=27$ GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV). The most robust way to handle the relativistic kinematics is to use the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n*   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n*   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame is dilated and can be accurately calculated using the formula: $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n\n*   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n*   $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nNow we substitute the value of $\\lambda$ into our formula. A direct calculation based on the literal \"30%\" condition gives:\n\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n*   $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **4. Analysis of Results and Careful Points**\n\nA number of careful points are essential for reaching the correct final answer, all of which were highlighted consistently across the candidate analyses.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Comparison with Options & Order of Magnitude.**\n    Our calculated value is $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this to the provided options:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    Only option **A** has the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$). The others are incorrect by factors of thousands or more, making A the only physically plausible choice.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis.**\n    There is a ~9% discrepancy between our direct calculation ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the value in option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). This strongly suggests, as correctly identified by nearly all candidate answers, that \"30%\" is a convenient approximation used in the problem statement for a simpler fraction, likely **1/3** (~33.3%). Let's test this well-founded hypothesis:\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   $d_{res} \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\bf{2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Final Decision.**\n    This refined result, **$2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for option A, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended interpretation for the problem. Both the direct calculation (which points to the correct option by order of magnitude) and the refined calculation (which provides an almost exact match) conclusively identify A as the correct answer. Note that confusion among the candidate answers regarding the final letter is due to them receiving the options in a different order; the numerical result is consistent. Based on the options in this prompt, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying all crucial points.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**: The question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) to observe at least 30% of the decays. Since the $X^0$ particle is neutral, it leaves no track. A decay is considered \"observed\" only if the particle travels a distance from its creation point that is *greater* than the detector's resolution, allowing the creation and decay points to be distinguished. This is a statistical process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability `P` that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` (in the lab frame) will travel a distance greater than `d_res` is:\n    $P(\\text{distance} > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    To find the minimum resolution for observing at least 30% of decays, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Solving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**: The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic.

Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to observe at least 30% of particle decays. The key steps are:\n*   **Defining Observation**: The initial particle $X^0$ is neutral and leaves no track. Its decay is \"observed\" only if it travels a distance `d` from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve as distinct from the decay point where the charged products appear. This means the condition for an observed decay is `d > d_res`.\n*   **Applying the Decay Law**: Particle decay is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` (in the laboratory frame) will travel a distance `d` or greater is:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n*   **Setting the Boundary Condition**: To find the minimum resolution for observing \"at least 30%\" of decays, we solve for the boundary case where the probability is exactly 30% (or 0.30):\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Solving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm yields:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**2.

The probability that a particle will travel a distance of at least `d` before decaying is given by the survival function: $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, where `λ` is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### **2. Formulation and Calculation Steps**\n\nThe agents consistently followed these steps:\n\n**Step A: Set up the Mathematical Condition for Resolution.**\nTo observe \"at least 30%\" of decays, we must find the minimum resolution $d_{res}$ that satisfies the boundary condition:\n$$P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nSolving for $d_{res}$ yields:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ) in the Lab Frame.**\nThis requires using relativistic kinematics.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$):** The most accurate method uses the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length (λ):** The formula relating the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) to the lab-frame mean decay length ($\\lambda$) via momentum is:\n    *   $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    *   $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nSubstitute the calculated value of `λ` into the equation from Step A.\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n*   $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3. Analysis, Careful Points, and Final Decision**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Order of Magnitude Check.**\nThe calculation based on a literal interpretation of \"30%\" gives a resolution of approximately **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. Comparing this with the options provided:\n*   A) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n*   B) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n*   C) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n*   D) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n\nOnly option **D** has the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$). The other options are off by factors of 1000 or more, making D the only plausible answer.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis.**\nThe calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the value in option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. As correctly identified by a strong consensus of the agents, this suggests an intentional design choice in the question. In physics problems, round percentages like \"30%\" are often convenient approximations for simpler fractions. Testing the likely hypothesis that the intended survival probability was **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$):\n*   The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n*   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n*   Using the calculated `λ` and `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`:\n    $d_{res} \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis refined result, **$2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for option D, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a discrepancy of less than 0.5%. This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended path to the solution. Both the direct calculation (which identifies the correct option by order of magnitude) and the more refined calculation (which provides an almost exact numerical match) conclusively point to **D** as the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a multi-step calculation combining principles from special relativity with the statistical laws of particle decay. All provided candidate answers correctly identify the same general methodology. The following is a synthesized analysis of the solution, including all critical steps and careful points.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**\n    The core of the problem lies in translating \"observe at least 30% of the decays\" into a physical condition. A neutral particle, $X^0$, leaves no track, so its decay is only \"observed\" if it travels a distance `d` from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve. This means the particle's travel distance must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n\n    Particle decay is a statistical process. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `d` or greater is given by the exponential decay law:\n    $$P(travel\\_distance \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$$\n    where `λ` is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame. To find the *minimum* resolution to observe *at least* 30% of the decays, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\n    Solving for `d_res` gives:\n    $$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n    The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must calculate its mean decay length in the laboratory frame using relativistic kinematics.\n\n    *   **Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$)**: The most robust method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        $$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n\n    *   **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**: The formula relating the lab-frame mean decay length to the proper lifetime is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$. Using $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s and $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s:\n        $$ \\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Minimum Resolution and Analyze Results**\n    Substituting the value of `λ` back into the equation from Step 1 and using $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n    $$d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n    This direct calculation yields a result of approximately **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. This value is very close to the option `2.08*1e-6 m`, and has the correct order of magnitude, making it the only plausible answer.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** The crucial first step is to correctly interpret \"observing a decay\" as a statistical condition where the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector resolution, modeled by the exponential survival function $e^{-d/\\lambda}$.\n\n*   **Robust Relativistic Calculation:** Using the energy-momentum relation to find `pc` first, and then using that to calculate the mean decay length `λ`, is the most accurate method that avoids potential intermediate rounding errors from calculating velocity and the Lorentz factor separately.\n\n*   **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis:** This is the key insight identified by all the candidate answers. The calculated value based on a literal \"30%\" is ~$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This differs from the provided option value of $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m by about 9%. In multiple-choice physics problems, round percentages are often used as approximations for simpler fractions. Testing the hypothesis that the problem was designed for a survival probability of **1/3** (~33.3%) gives:\n    *   Condition: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    *   Resolution: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n    *   Calculation: $d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n\nThis refined result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for the option **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a discrepancy of less than 0.5%. This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended interpretation. Both the direct calculation (which points to the correct order of magnitude) and the refined calculation (which gives a near-perfect numerical match) conclusively identify the same option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying all crucial points.\n\n### **1. Physical Interpretation of the Question**\n\nThe central task is to find the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the neutral particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The \"Observation\" Condition.** Since the $X^0$ particle is neutral, it leaves no track. A decay is considered \"observed\" only if the particle travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector's resolution to distinguish it from the decay point (where the charged products $Y^+$ and $Z^-$ appear). Therefore, the particle must travel a distance `d` that is **greater** than the resolution `d_res`.\n\n*   **The Exponential Decay Law**: Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` will travel a distance of at least `d_res` is described by the survival function:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n\n*   **Mathematical Formulation**: To observe \"at least 30%\" of decays, we set up the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Solving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm gives:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### **2. Relativistic Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nThe particle is highly relativistic ($E=27$ GeV is much larger than $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV). We must calculate the time-dilated mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Using Momentum for Relativistic Calculations.** The most robust method is to first find the particle's momentum (`pc`) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$. This avoids potential rounding errors from calculating velocity and the Lorentz factor separately.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The lab-frame mean decay length is given by:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n    Using $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s and the given $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s:\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.853) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3. Final Calculation and Decision**\n\n*   **Calculation based on literal \"30%\":**\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Comparison with Options and Order of Magnitude Check.**\n    Our calculated value is $\\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **C**. All other options are incorrect by a factor of 1,000 or more. This check alone is sufficient to select C as the only plausible answer.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis.** The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the value in option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. In multiple-choice physics problems, a round number like \"30%\" often approximates a simpler fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the problem was designed for a survival probability of **1/3** (~33.3%).\n    The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$, which solves to $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    $d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (\\ln(3)) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis refined result ($2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is an almost perfect match for option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides very strong evidence that this was the intended method for designing the question's answer.\n\nBoth the direct calculation and the refined analysis point conclusively to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
