Identify the Physical Principles\nThe problem involves the decay of particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light. The key physical principles are:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of particles (`f`) that survive after a certain time is governed by an exponential decay law.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** For a fast-moving particle, time passes more slowly in its own reference frame compared to the laboratory's reference frame. This means its lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab. The observed lifetime (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's intrinsic lifetime in its own rest frame (`τ_proper`) by the Lorentz factor, `γ`, such that `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Survival Equation\nThe fraction of particles `f` that survive after a time `t_lab` in the laboratory frame is given by:\n`f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n*   The time of flight to the detector wall is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n*   The dilated lifetime is `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n\nSubstituting these into the survival equation gives:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\nFor this specific problem, the term `K = R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant because the detector radius `R` and the particle's proper lifetime `τ_proper` do not change. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### 3. Set Up a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown\nWe can rearrange the simplified equation by taking the natural logarithm:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\n`K = -γ * ln(f)` or `K = γ * ln(1/f)`\n\nSince `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can set them equal:\n`γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂)`\n\n### 4. Substitute Values and Calculate\nWe are given:\n*   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n*   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the ratio:\n`20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = γ₂ * ln(1 / (2/3))`\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\nUsing the standard values for natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### 5. Conclusion and Final Answer\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.18. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 28\nB) 40\nC) 54\nD) 68\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 54.\n\nA logical check confirms this: to have more particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must experience less decay. For a fixed travel distance, this means their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a greater time dilation effect, which corresponds to a *higher* Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is higher than the initial `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires an understanding of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and its application to exponential particle decay.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The fraction of particles, `f = N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t` is governed by the exponential decay law. This law must be applied in the particle's own rest frame (proper time, `t_p`).\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime, a constant for a given particle type.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The time experienced by the particle (`t_p`) is different from the time measured in the laboratory (`t_lab`) due to time dilation. The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `t_p = t_lab / γ`\n    A higher Lorentz factor means the particle experiences less time for the same lab-frame duration, and therefore decays less.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The time it takes for the particles to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab = R/v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Survival Equation:** By substituting the expressions for `t_p` and `t_lab` into the decay law, we get the fraction of particles that survive to reach the detector wall:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n    The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n5.  **Setting up a Ratio:** We can solve this problem without knowing the value of `K` by setting up a ratio between the two scenarios. By rearranging the equation `ln(f) = -K / γ`, we get `K = -γ * ln(f)`. Since `K` is constant:\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n    `γ₁ * ln(f₁) = γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n6.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** Now, we can plug in the known values:\n    *   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Scenario 2: `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    `20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `20 * [-ln(3)] = γ₂ * [-ln(3/2)]`\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Isolating `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n7.  **Calculation:**\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.18. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 40\nB) 54\nC) 68\nD) 28\n\nThe calculated result is closest to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires us to determine the new Lorentz factor (`γ₂`) needed for a higher fraction of particles to survive and reach a detector. The core principles involved are exponential decay and relativistic time dilation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after traveling a certain distance is governed by the exponential decay law. In the laboratory's frame of reference, this is:\n    `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n    where `t_lab` is the time of flight in the lab frame, and `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Incorporate Relativistic Effects:**\n    *   **Time of Flight (`t_lab`):** The particles travel the detector's radius, `R = 30 m`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Therefore, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   **Time Dilation (`τ_lab`):** The particle's lifetime as measured in the lab is dilated by the Lorentz factor `γ`. It is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the formula: `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the survival equation gives:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    The term `K = R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup, as `R`, `c`, and `τ_proper` do not change. The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n4.  **Set Up Equations for the Two Scenarios:**\n    We have two conditions, which we can use to solve for the unknown `γ₂`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n5.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    A robust way to solve this is to take the natural logarithm of both equations and then form a ratio to eliminate the constant `K`.\n\n    From Scenario 1:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  =>  `-ln(3) = -K / 20`  =>  `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    From Scenario 2:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  =>  `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`  =>  `K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Now, we can set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 40\nB) 68\nC) 54\nD) 28\n\nThe closest answer is 54.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   **Time Dilation is Key:** The core of the problem is that a higher Lorentz factor (`γ`) leads to greater time dilation, making the particle's lifetime appear longer in the lab frame. This allows more particles to survive the journey.\n*   **Logical Check:** To increase the survival fraction from 1/3 to 2/3, the Lorentz factor must increase. Our result (`γ₂ ≈ 54`) is greater than the initial value (`γ₁ = 20`), which is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Eliminating Constants:** The problem can be solved without knowing the particle's proper lifetime (`τ_proper`) or the exact speed of light (`c`) by setting up a ratio between the two scenarios, which cancels these constants.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires an understanding of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and its effect on exponential particle decay.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    The fraction of particles, `f = N/N₀`, that survive after a certain time is governed by the exponential decay law. This law must be applied in the particle's own rest frame (proper frame).\n    `f = exp(-t_proper / τ)`\n    where `t_proper` is the time experienced by the particle (proper time) and `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime (a constant for the particle type).\n\n2.  **Relate Lab Frame to Proper Frame:**\n    We observe the experiment in the laboratory frame. The time it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n    Due to time dilation, the time experienced by the moving particle is shorter than the lab time. The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `t_proper = t_lab / γ`\n    Substituting `t_lab`, we get:\n    `t_proper = (R / c) / γ`\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Substitute the expression for `t_proper` into the survival equation:\n    `f = exp(- (R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n    The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this experiment, as the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime do not change. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n4.  **Apply the First Scenario:**\n    We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction is `f₁ = 1/3`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Apply the Second Scenario and Solve for the New Lorentz Factor:**\n    We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the survival fraction is `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Take the natural logarithm again:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    Now, substitute the expression for `K` we found in the previous step:\n    `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`:\n    `-ln(3/2) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    Finally, rearrange to solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 54.2.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Proper Time:** The exponential decay law must be applied using the proper time experienced by the particle, not the time measured in the lab.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Correctly applying the time dilation formula `t_proper = t_lab / γ` is essential.\n*   **Sanity Check:** To have more particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must experience less proper time during their flight. For a fixed flight distance, this requires a higher velocity, and therefore a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** The provided candidate answers almost unanimously derive the correct formula and calculate a value of ~54.2. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, C, D) appear to be simple mapping errors between the calculated number and the option letter, not errors in the physics or mathematics.\n\nThe calculated value of ~54.2 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe analysis and calculation have been completed.\n\n1.  **Physical Model:** The fraction of surviving particles `P` is related to the Lorentz factor `γ` by the formula `P = exp(-K/γ)`, where `K` is a constant incorporating the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime.\n2.  **Derivation:** By setting up a ratio between the two scenarios (initial and target), we derived the formula for the new Lorentz factor `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = γ₁ * ln(1/P₁) / ln(1/P₂)`\n    Plugging in the values `γ₁ = 20`, `P₁ = 1/3`, and `P₂ = 2/3`, this becomes:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n3.  **Calculation:** The Python code executed this formula and returned the result `54.1902258270291`.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

This involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and the law of radioactive decay.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Particle Survival Formula:** The fraction of particles, `P`, that survive after a time `t_lab` in the laboratory's frame of reference is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `P = N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n    where `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime as measured in the lab.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** Due to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` is extended in the lab frame compared to its proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are described as \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Equation:** By substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay formula, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector wall:\n    `P = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n5.  **Setting up a Ratio:** The term `R/(cτ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The formula becomes `P = exp(-K / γ)`. We can rearrange this by taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(P) = -K / γ`\n    `γ * ln(1/P) = K`\n\n    Since `K` is constant for both scenarios, we can write:\n    `γ₁ * ln(1/P₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/P₂)`\n\n6.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** We can now plug in the known values:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `P₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `P₂ = 2/3`\n\n    `20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = γ₂ * ln(1 / (2/3))`\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Now, we can isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n7.  **Calculation:** The code output confirms the numerical calculation:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5)) ≈ 54.19`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 40\nB) 68\nC) 28\nD) 54\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 54.2 is closest to 54.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe problem requires us to determine the Lorentz factor (γ) needed for two-thirds of a group of particles to reach a detector, given the conditions under which one-third of them reach it.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Establish the Physics Model:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after traveling for a time `t_lab` in the laboratory's reference frame is governed by the exponential decay law. This law must account for time dilation from special relativity.\n    *   The decay law is `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the lab-frame lifetime is extended by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`, where `τ_proper` is the particle's lifetime in its own rest frame.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab, `t_lab`, is the distance (detector radius `R`) divided by the velocity (`v`). Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, `v ≈ c` (the speed of light), so `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:** By substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay law, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector wall:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    The term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for a given particle type and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n3.  **Use the Initial Conditions (Scenario 1):**\n    *   Initial Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Initial survival fraction, `f₁ = 1/3`.\n    Plugging these into the simplified equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Target Condition (Scenario 2):**\n    *   Target survival fraction, `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    Using the same equation with the value of `K` we just found:\n    `2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -20 * ln(3) / γ₂`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(x/y) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3/2) = -20 * ln(3) / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3) / γ₂`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    Now, we use the approximate values for the natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.18.

This law must account for time dilation.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`, where `R` is the detector radius (30 m) and `c` is the speed of light. This is because the particles are \"ultra-relativistic\".\n    *   The mean lifetime of the particles in the lab frame, `τ_lab`, is dilated by the Lorentz factor, `γ`. It is related to the particle's intrinsic (proper) lifetime, `τ_proper`, by the formula `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n    *   The survival fraction is therefore `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`. Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` gives:\n        `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n2.  **Group Constants:** The term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The survival equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n3.  **Set Up Equations for Both Scenarios:** We have two distinct scenarios from the problem description.\n    *   **Scenario 1:** A fraction `f₁ = 1/3` of particles survive with a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** We want to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which a fraction `f₂ = 2/3` of particles survive.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** The most efficient way to solve for `γ₂` is to eliminate the unknown constant `K`. We can do this by taking the natural logarithm of both equations and then finding their ratio.\n    *   From Scenario 1: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  =>  `-ln(3) = -K / 20`  =>  `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   From Scenario 2: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  =>  `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`  =>  `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for `K` from the first equation into the second:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Using the standard values for natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Sanity Check:** To have more particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must decay less. For a fixed travel distance, this means they must experience less proper time. This requires a *higher* Lorentz factor (`γ`) to increase time dilation. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is higher than `γ₁ = 20`, which makes physical sense.\n*   **Consistency of Analysis:** All the provided candidate answers that perform the calculation correctly arrive at the same mathematical expression and a numerical result of ~54.2.

The lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's intrinsic lifetime in its own rest frame (`τ_proper`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation**:\n    *   The time it takes for the particles to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The decay formula must use the time and lifetime from the same reference frame. In the lab frame, the fraction of surviving particles is `f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`, we get the fundamental equation for this problem:\n        `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n3.  **Set Up Equations for Both Scenarios**: The term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for this experiment, as the detector and particle type do not change. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation becomes `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   **Scenario 1**: `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   **Scenario 2**: `f₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂` is the unknown we need to find.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**: The most efficient way to solve this is to eliminate the constant `K`.\n    *   First, take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  => `ln(3) = K / 20`  => `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  => `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`  => `K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    *   Now, set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n        `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   Isolate `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value**:\n    *   Using the standard values for natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Errors\n\n*   **Correct Physics**: Nearly all candidate answers correctly identify the physics and derive the correct formula for `γ₂`. The reasoning is sound.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy**: The numerical calculation is consistently and correctly performed across the board, yielding a result of approximately 54.2.\n*   **Primary Failure Mode**: The most common error among the candidate answers is incorrectly matching the calculated result (`~54.2`) to the given multiple-choice options (A=68, B=54, C=28, D=40). For example, Answer 2 calculates `~54.19` but concludes `<<<A>>>` (68), and Answer 3 calculates `~54.18` but concludes `<<<C>>>` (28). This is a simple but critical error in the final step.\n*   **Logical Check**: To have more particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must experience less decay. For a fixed travel distance, this means their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab frame. This requires a *higher* degree of time dilation, which corresponds to a *higher* Lorentz factor. The calculated `γ₂ ≈ 54` is greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physical expectation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe derivation and calculation are robust and consistently point to a value of approximately 54.2.

    "Based on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and a list of careful points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principles**: The problem combines two core concepts: the exponential law of particle decay and the time dilation effect from special relativity.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation**:\n    *   The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` is given by the decay law `f = exp(-t / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime in the relevant reference frame.\n    *   The experiment is observed in the lab frame. The time of flight for the particles to cross the detector radius `R` is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab (`τ_lab`) is extended by the Lorentz factor `γ` compared to its intrinsic lifetime in its own rest frame (`τ_proper`). The relationship is `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n    *   Substituting these into the decay law gives the survival fraction in the lab frame:\n        `f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab) = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Equation**: The term `K = R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for this experiment, as the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties do not change. The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n4.  **Set Up a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown**: We can rearrange the equation by taking the natural logarithm: `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which gives `K = -γ * ln(f)` or `K = γ * ln(1/f)`.

Applying the decay law without accounting for the extended lifetime in the lab frame would be incorrect.\n*   **Use of Ratios**: The most efficient solution method is to form a ratio between the two scenarios. This correctly cancels out the unknown constants (`R`, `c`, `τ_proper`), making the problem solvable without needing their specific values.\n*   **Non-Linear Relationship**: The relationship between the survival fraction and the Lorentz factor is exponential. One cannot assume a simple linear scaling (e.g., doubling the survival fraction does not mean doubling the Lorentz factor).\n*   **Logical Sanity Check**: To increase the survival fraction from 1/3 to 2/3, the particles must have a higher chance of surviving the journey. This means they must experience less proper time, which requires a greater time dilation effect. A greater time dilation corresponds to a *higher* Lorentz factor. The result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is higher than the initial `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options**: A critical final step is to accurately match the calculated numerical value (~54.2) to the provided multiple-choice options. An analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly performed the calculation, many failed at this final step by referencing inconsistent option lists.

Identify the Physical Principles\nThe problem involves the decay of particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light. The key physical principles are:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of particles (`f`) that survive after a certain time is governed by an exponential decay law.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** For a fast-moving particle, time passes more slowly in its own reference frame compared to the laboratory's reference frame. This means its lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab. The observed lifetime (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's intrinsic lifetime in its own rest frame (`τ_proper`) by the Lorentz factor, `γ`, such that `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Survival Equation\nThe fraction of particles `f` that survive after a time `t_lab` in the laboratory frame is given by:\n`f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n*   The time of flight to the detector wall is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n*   The dilated lifetime is `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n\nSubstituting these into the survival equation gives:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\nFor this specific problem, the term `K = R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant because the detector radius `R` and the particle's proper lifetime `τ_proper` do not change. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### 3. Set Up a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown\nWe can rearrange the simplified equation by taking the natural logarithm:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\n`K = -γ * ln(f)` or `K = γ * ln(1/f)`\n\nSince `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can set them equal:\n`γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂)`\n\n### 4. Substitute Values and Calculate\nWe are given:\n*   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n*   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the ratio:\n`20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = γ₂ * ln(1 / (2/3))`\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\nUsing the standard values for natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### 5.

For a fixed travel distance, this means their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a greater time dilation effect, which corresponds to a *higher* Lorentz factor.

This law must be applied in the particle's own rest frame (proper time, `t_p`).\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime, a constant for a given particle type.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The time experienced by the particle (`t_p`) is different from the time measured in the laboratory (`t_lab`) due to time dilation. The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `t_p = t_lab / γ`\n    A higher Lorentz factor means the particle experiences less time for the same lab-frame duration, and therefore decays less.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The time it takes for the particles to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab = R/v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Survival Equation:** By substituting the expressions for `t_p` and `t_lab` into the decay law, we get the fraction of particles that survive to reach the detector wall:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n    The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n5.  **Setting up a Ratio:** We can solve this problem without knowing the value of `K` by setting up a ratio between the two scenarios. By rearranging the equation `ln(f) = -K / γ`, we get `K = -γ * ln(f)`. Since `K` is constant:\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n    `γ₁ * ln(f₁) = γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n6.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** Now, we can plug in the known values:\n    *   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Scenario 2: `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    `20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `20 * [-ln(3)] = γ₂ * [-ln(3/2)]`\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Isolating `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n7.  **Calculation:**\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.18.

In the laboratory's frame of reference, this is:\n    `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n    where `t_lab` is the time of flight in the lab frame, and `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Incorporate Relativistic Effects:**\n    *   **Time of Flight (`t_lab`):** The particles travel the detector's radius, `R = 30 m`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Therefore, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   **Time Dilation (`τ_lab`):** The particle's lifetime as measured in the lab is dilated by the Lorentz factor `γ`. It is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the formula: `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the survival equation gives:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    The term `K = R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup, as `R`, `c`, and `τ_proper` do not change. The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n4.  **Set Up Equations for the Two Scenarios:**\n    We have two conditions, which we can use to solve for the unknown `γ₂`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n5.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    A robust way to solve this is to take the natural logarithm of both equations and then form a ratio to eliminate the constant `K`.\n\n    From Scenario 1:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  =>  `-ln(3) = -K / 20`  =>  `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    From Scenario 2:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  =>  `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`  =>  `K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Now, we can set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.

This allows more particles to survive the journey.\n*   **Logical Check:** To increase the survival fraction from 1/3 to 2/3, the Lorentz factor must increase. Our result (`γ₂ ≈ 54`) is greater than the initial value (`γ₁ = 20`), which is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Eliminating Constants:** The problem can be solved without knowing the particle's proper lifetime (`τ_proper`) or the exact speed of light (`c`) by setting up a ratio between the two scenarios, which cancels these constants.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires an understanding of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and its effect on exponential particle decay.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    The fraction of particles, `f = N/N₀`, that survive after a certain time is governed by the exponential decay law. This law must be applied in the particle's own rest frame (proper frame).\n    `f = exp(-t_proper / τ)`\n    where `t_proper` is the time experienced by the particle (proper time) and `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime (a constant for the particle type).\n\n2.  **Relate Lab Frame to Proper Frame:**\n    We observe the experiment in the laboratory frame. The time it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n    Due to time dilation, the time experienced by the moving particle is shorter than the lab time. The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `t_proper = t_lab / γ`\n    Substituting `t_lab`, we get:\n    `t_proper = (R / c) / γ`\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Substitute the expression for `t_proper` into the survival equation:\n    `f = exp(- (R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n    The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this experiment, as the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime do not change. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n4.  **Apply the First Scenario:**\n    We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction is `f₁ = 1/3`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n5.  **Apply the Second Scenario and Solve for the New Lorentz Factor:**\n    We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the survival fraction is `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Take the natural logarithm again:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    Now, substitute the expression for `K` we found in the previous step:\n    `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`:\n    `-ln(3/2) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    Finally, rearrange to solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 54.2.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Proper Time:** The exponential decay law must be applied using the proper time experienced by the particle, not the time measured in the lab.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Correctly applying the time dilation formula `t_proper = t_lab / γ` is essential.\n*   **Sanity Check:** To have more particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must experience less proper time during their flight. For a fixed flight distance, this requires a higher velocity, and therefore a higher Lorentz factor `γ`.

The relationship is:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are described as \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Equation:** By substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay formula, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector wall:\n    `P = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n5.  **Setting up a Ratio:** The term `R/(cτ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The formula becomes `P = exp(-K / γ)`. We can rearrange this by taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(P) = -K / γ`\n    `γ * ln(1/P) = K`\n\n    Since `K` is constant for both scenarios, we can write:\n    `γ₁ * ln(1/P₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/P₂)`\n\n6.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** We can now plug in the known values:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `P₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `P₂ = 2/3`\n\n    `20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = γ₂ * ln(1 / (2/3))`\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Now, we can isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n7.  **Calculation:** The code output confirms the numerical calculation:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5)) ≈ 54.19`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 40\nB) 68\nC) 28\nD) 54\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 54.2 is closest to 54.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe problem requires us to determine the Lorentz factor (γ) needed for two-thirds of a group of particles to reach a detector, given the conditions under which one-third of them reach it.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Establish the Physics Model:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after traveling for a time `t_lab` in the laboratory's reference frame is governed by the exponential decay law. This law must account for time dilation from special relativity.\n    *   The decay law is `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the lab-frame lifetime is extended by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`, where `τ_proper` is the particle's lifetime in its own rest frame.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab, `t_lab`, is the distance (detector radius `R`) divided by the velocity (`v`). Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, `v ≈ c` (the speed of light), so `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:** By substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay law, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector wall:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    The term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for a given particle type and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n3.  **Use the Initial Conditions (Scenario 1):**\n    *   Initial Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Initial survival fraction, `f₁ = 1/3`.\n    Plugging these into the simplified equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Target Condition (Scenario 2):**\n    *   Target survival fraction, `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    Using the same equation with the value of `K` we just found:\n    `2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -20 * ln(3) / γ₂`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(x/y) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3/2) = -20 * ln(3) / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3) / γ₂`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    Now, we use the approximate values for the natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.18.

This law must account for time dilation.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`, where `R` is the detector radius (30 m) and `c` is the speed of light. This is because the particles are \"ultra-relativistic\".\n    *   The mean lifetime of the particles in the lab frame, `τ_lab`, is dilated by the Lorentz factor, `γ`. It is related to the particle's intrinsic (proper) lifetime, `τ_proper`, by the formula `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n    *   The survival fraction is therefore `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`. Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` gives:\n        `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n2.  **Group Constants:** The term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup.

This dilated lifetime `τ_lab` is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\n3.  **Determine the Time of Flight:**\n    The particles travel a distance equal to the detector's radius, `R = 30 m`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay equation gives the fraction of particles that reach the detector wall:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    The term `K = R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n5.  **Set Up a Ratio of the Two Scenarios:**\n    We can rearrange the simplified equation by taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n    `γ * ln(1/f) = K`\n    Since `K` is constant for both scenarios, we can write:\n    `γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    We are given:\n    *   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Scenario 2: `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    Plugging these values into the ratio equation:\n    `20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = γ₂ * ln(1 / (2/3))`\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Now, we can isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the standard approximate values for natural logarithms:\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.18. This is extremely close to the option C.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The core of the problem is correctly applying the time dilation formula to the particle's lifetime in the decay equation.\n*   The \"ultra-relativistic\" nature of the particles allows the simplification `v ≈ c`.\n*   Solving the problem by creating a ratio of the two scenarios is the most efficient method, as it cancels out the unknown constants related to the particle's proper lifetime and the detector's radius.\n*   A logical check confirms the result: to increase the survival fraction, the particles must experience less proper time, which requires a higher Lorentz factor. Our result (`~54`) is greater than the initial factor (`20`), which is consistent with the physics.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully calculated the new Lorentz factor required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector.

The execution produced a result of `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 28\nB) 40\nC) 54\nD) 68\n\nThe calculated value of 54.19 is closest to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis problem requires an understanding of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and its application to particle decay.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in a given reference frame is described by the exponential decay law:\n    `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_frame)`\n    where `τ_frame` is the mean lifetime of the particle in that specific frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The problem is observed from the laboratory's frame of reference. Due to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` appears longer in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) than its intrinsic lifetime in its own rest frame (`τ_proper`). The relationship is:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are described as \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector's radius `R` in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Survival Equation:** By substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay law, we get the fraction of particles that survive to reach the detector wall:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n5.  **Solving with a Ratio:** The term `K = R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for this experiment, as it depends only on the detector's size and the particle's intrinsic properties. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. We can rearrange this by taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n    `K = -γ * ln(f)` or `K = γ * ln(1/f)`\n\n    Since `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can set them equal:\n    `γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂)`\n\n### Applying the Scenarios\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, and the survival fraction `f₁ = 1/3`.\n*   **Scenario 2:** We need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for a survival fraction `f₂ = 2/3`.\n\nPlugging these values into the ratio equation:\n`20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = γ₂ * ln(1 / (2/3))`\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n### Calculation\n\nUsing the standard values for natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n*   **Logical Check:** To have more particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must experience less proper time during their flight. For a fixed distance, this requires a higher velocity and thus a *higher* Lorentz factor. The calculated `γ₂ ≈ 54` is higher than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** The provided candidate answers almost unanimously agree on the derivation and the final numerical result of ~54.19. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to errors in mapping their calculated result to the options provided in the prompt.\n*   **Final Answer:** The calculated value of approximately 54.18 is closest to the option **B) 54**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the provided candidate answers and identifying crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physics**: The problem involves the decay of particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light. This requires combining two key principles:\n    *   **Exponential Decay**: The fraction of particles (`f`) that survive after a time `t` is given by `f = exp(-t / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime in the relevant reference frame.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation)**: A moving particle's lifetime appears longer to a stationary observer. The lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's intrinsic lifetime in its own rest frame (`τ_proper`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation**:\n    *   The time it takes for the particles to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The decay formula must use the time and lifetime from the same reference frame. In the lab frame, the fraction of surviving particles is `f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`, we get the fundamental equation for this problem:\n        `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n3.  **Set Up Equations for Both Scenarios**: The term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for this experiment, as the detector and particle type do not change. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation becomes `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   **Scenario 1**: `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   **Scenario 2**: `f₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂` is the unknown we need to find.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**: The most efficient way to solve this is to eliminate the constant `K`.\n    *   First, take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  => `ln(3) = K / 20`  => `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  => `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`  => `K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    *   Now, set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n        `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   Isolate `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value**:\n    *   Using the standard values for natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Errors\n\n*   **Correct Physics**: Nearly all candidate answers correctly identify the physics and derive the correct formula for `γ₂`. The reasoning is sound.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy**: The numerical calculation is consistently and correctly performed across the board, yielding a result of approximately 54.2.\n*   **Primary Failure Mode**: The most common error among the candidate answers is incorrectly matching the calculated result (`~54.2`) to the given multiple-choice options (A=68, B=54, C=28, D=40). For example, Answer 2 calculates `~54.19` but concludes `<<<A>>>` (68), and Answer 3 calculates `~54.18` but concludes `<<<C>>>` (28). This is a simple but critical error in the final step.\n*   **Logical Check**: To have more particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must experience less decay. For a fixed travel distance, this means their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab frame. This requires a *higher* degree of time dilation, which corresponds to a *higher* Lorentz factor. The calculated `γ₂ ≈ 54` is greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physical expectation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe derivation and calculation are robust and consistently point to a value of approximately 54.2. This value corresponds directly to option B. The errors in the majority of the provided candidate answers are not in their scientific reasoning but in the final step of selecting the correct option letter.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
