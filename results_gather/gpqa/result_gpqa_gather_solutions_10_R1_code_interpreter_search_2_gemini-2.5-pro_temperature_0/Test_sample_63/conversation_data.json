Let's analyze the effect of each tube:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   Mass change = 0. This indicates that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, which means the gas contained oxygen atoms that were transferred to the copper.\n    *   Mass increase = 0.80 g. This is the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas (O₂ + 2Cu → 2CuO) or another oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO). In either case, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms were delivered by the gas stream.\n\n*   **Final Gas C:** The remaining gas does not react with any of the reagents.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the reactants are salts likely containing nitrogen (as we will see), this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the initial salts. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O from H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O that formed CuO = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming Gas C is N₂.\n    *   The final gas is 0.10 mol of N₂. We must also account for any N₂ produced in Tube 3 if the reacting gas was N₂O.\n    *   Let's consider the two possibilities for the gas reacting in Tube 3:\n        1.  If it was O₂, then the initial gas mixture contained 0.10 mol N₂. Total N = 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol.\n        2.  If it was N₂O, then 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted (since it contains 0.05 mol of O). This reaction (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO) produces 0.05 mol of N₂. The final 0.10 mol of N₂ would be this 0.05 mol plus 0.05 mol of N₂ that was present initially. In this case, the total nitrogen is also 0.05 mol (from N₂O) + 0.05 mol (from initial N₂) = 0.10 mol of N₂ molecules, which is 0.20 mol of N atoms.\n    *   In both plausible scenarios, the total moles of Nitrogen atoms in the products is 0.20 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture contains:\n*   0.40 mol of H\n*   0.25 mol of O\n*   0.20 mol of N\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains n moles of salt A and n moles of salt B. The combined chemical formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B must have an elemental ratio of N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get integers, divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiply by 4 to get whole numbers:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nWe need to find two common salts (A and B) that are composed of N, H, and O, and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The fact that they decompose completely into gases at 200°C strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions.\nLet's try the most common ones: ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n*   **Salt A candidate:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Formula: N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Salt B candidate:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Formula: N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅.\nThis is a perfect match.\n\nWe can verify this by checking the total mass.\nMolar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\nMolar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\nThe total moles of elements (N=0.20, H=0.40, O=0.25) correspond to a total mass of 0.20*14 + 0.40*1 + 0.25*16 = 2.8 + 0.4 + 4.0 = 7.20 g, which matches the initial mass.\nThe number of moles of the (N₄H₈O₅) unit is 7.20 g / (80+64) g/mol = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\nSince the mixture is equimolar (n moles of A and n moles of B), the 0.05 mol of the combined unit corresponds to 0.05 mol of A and 0.05 mol of B. This is consistent with all the data derived in the first steps.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms in A and B:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17 atoms.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the products of the thermal decomposition\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from heating the salts was passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze what each tube tells us about the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)**\n    *   This solution is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂) or sulfur dioxide (SO₂).\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change, indicating that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas did not react with a strong dehydrating agent, limewater, or hot copper, it is likely nitrogen gas (N₂), a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n### 2. Verify the composition and identify the salts\n\nLet's summarize the decomposition products:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.025 mol of O₂\n*   0.10 mol of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂)\n\nLet's check the total mass of these products:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of gases = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass is exactly equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture, which confirms our identification of the products and their quantities. The original salts must therefore be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nThe production of N₂, H₂O, and O₂ upon heating is characteristic of the decomposition of certain ammonium salts. The most common salts that fit this profile are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's assume:\n*   Salt A is **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   Salt B is **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n1.  NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n2.  2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let 'x' be the number of moles of each salt.\n*   Moles of NH₄NO₂ = x\n*   Moles of NH₄NO₃ = x\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reactions, we can calculate the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total H₂O:** (2 * x) from NH₄NO₂ + (4/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   **Total O₂:** 0 from NH₄NO₂ + (1/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = 0.5x\n*   **Total N₂:** (1 * x) from NH₄NO₂ + (2/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = x + x = 2x\n\nNow, we can use the moles of products we calculated earlier to find 'x':\n*   From O₂: 0.5x = 0.025 mol  => x = 0.05 mol.\n*   From H₂O: 4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This matches our calculation).\n*   From N₂: 2x = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe value x = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products. Let's also verify the initial mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.05 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol) = 3.202 g + 4.0025 g = 7.2045 g.\nThis is consistent with the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total number of atoms\n\nThe salts have been correctly identified as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 2 Oxygen (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 3 Oxygen (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** We'll start by using the information from the experiment to determine the chemical nature and amount (in moles) of each gaseous product formed when the salt mixture was heated.\n    *   The weight increase in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ (a drying agent) corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   The fact that the weight of the Ca(OH)₂ solution did not change means no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n    *   The weight increase of the red-hot copper is due to its reaction with oxygen (O₂), forming CuO. This increase is the mass of the oxygen.\n    *   The remaining gas, C, which passed through all tubes unreacted, can be identified by calculating its molar mass from the given volume at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). We'll also verify the law of conservation of mass.\n\n2.  **Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture:** Based on the moles of H₂O, O₂, and gas C, we can calculate the total moles of hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N) atoms in the original mixture. This will give us the overall empirical formula for the combined salts (A+B).\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:** The problem states that A and B are salts that decompose into only gaseous products. The presence of H₂O and N₂ as products strongly suggests they are ammonium salts. Since the mixture is equimolar, we can deduce the specific formulas of the two ammonium salts (A and B) that would combine to match the overall empirical formula we found.\n\n4.  **Verify the Identification:** We will use the total initial mass (7.20 g) and the fact that the mixture is equimolar to confirm that our identified salts are correct. We'll calculate the moles of the mixture.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** Once salts A and B are identified, we will count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B and sum them up to get the final answer.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan with the Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the Products\n# Given data\nmass_mixture = 7.20  # g\nmass_H2O = 3.60      # g, from tube #1\nmass_O2 = 0.80       # g, from tube #3\nvolume_gas_C_STP = 2.24 # L\n\n# Molar masses and constants\nM_H = 1.008\nM_N = 14.007\nM_O = 15.999\nM_H2O = 2 * M_H + M_O\nM_O2 = 2 * M_O\nM_N2 = 2 * M_N\nV_molar_STP = 22.4 # L/mol\n\n# Calculate moles of each product\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nmoles_O2 = mass_O2 / M_O2\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C_STP / V_molar_STP\n\n# Check conservation of mass to identify gas C\n# Assuming gas C is N2, let's calculate its mass\nmass_gas_C_assumed_N2 = moles_gas_C * M_N2\ntotal_product_mass = mass_H2O + mass_O2 + mass_gas_C_assumed_N2\n\n# The total product mass (7.20 g) matches the initial mixture mass.\n# This confirms that gas C is Nitrogen (N2).\n\n# Step 2: Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture\n# Calculate total moles of each element from the products\nmoles_H_total = moles_H2O * 2\nmoles_O_total = moles_H2O * 1 + moles_O2 * 2\nmoles_N_total = moles_gas_C * 2\n\n# The molar ratio of elements in the mixture is H:N:O\n# H : N : O  ~=  0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25\n# To get integers, we multiply by 20, giving a ratio of 8:4:5.\n# So the overall formula of (A+B) is H8N4O5.\n\n# Step 3: Identify Salts A and B\n# The products (N2, H2O) suggest ammonium salts.\n# The overall formula H8N4O5 contains 8 H atoms, which corresponds to two ammonium ions, (NH4)2.\n# (NH4)2 = N2H8.\n# Subtracting this from the total formula leaves the anions: H8N4O5 - N2H8 = N2O5.\n# The two anions must sum to N2O5. The most common and logical choice is nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-).\n# So, Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3) and Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2).\n\n# Step 4: Verify the Identification (optional but good practice)\nM_NH4NO3 = 2*M_N + 4*M_H + 3*M_O\nM_NH4NO2 = 2*M_N + 4*M_H + 2*M_O\n# Moles of mixture n = mass_mixture / (M_NH4NO3 + M_NH4NO2)\n# n = 7.20 / (80.04 + 64.04) = 7.20 / 144.08 ~= 0.05 mol.\n# This is consistent with our product moles:\n# moles_O2 = 0.025 mol (from 0.05 mol NH4NO3)\n# moles_N2 = 0.05 (from NH4NO3) + 0.05 (from NH4NO2) = 0.1 mol\n# moles_H2O = 0.1 (from NH4NO3) + 0.1 (from NH4NO2) = 0.2 mol\n# The identification is correct.\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n# Salt A: NH4NO3\natoms_in_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3  # N + H4 + N + O3\n# Salt B: NH4NO2\natoms_in_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2  # N + H4 + N + O2\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(f\"Salt A is identified as Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3).\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in one formula unit of A: {atoms_in_A}\")\nprint(f\"Salt B is identified as Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2).\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in one formula unit of B: {atoms_in_B}\")\nprint(f\"The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is: {total_atoms}\")\n\n# Match with options\noptions = {'A': 13, 'B': 17, 'C': 19, 'D': 15}\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    if value == total_atoms:\n        final_answer = choice\n        break\n\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {final_answer}.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer: {final_answer}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Salt A is identified as Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3).\nNumber of atoms in one formula unit of A: 9\nSalt B is identified as Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2).\nNumber of atoms in one formula unit of B: 8\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is: 17\nThis corresponds to option B.\nFinal Answer: B\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup and identify the products of decomposition.**\nThe mixture of gases formed by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase is 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.008) + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This is a crucial point: it means **no acidic gases** were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2(16.00) = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with any of the reagents. Given that the original salts are likely nitrogen compounds (a common theme in such problems), and no other elements are suggested, Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Summary of Products:**\nThe decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B yielded:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.025 mol of O₂\n*   0.10 mol of N₂\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\nWe can find the total moles of each element (H, O, N) in the original mixture by summing the atoms from the products.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen comes from both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the composition and find the formulas of the salts.**\nLet's check if the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\nThe problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. Let 'n' be the number of moles of salt A and also the number of moles of salt B.\nThe total moles of elements can be expressed as:\n*   n × (N atoms in A + N atoms in B) = 0.20 mol\n*   n × (H atoms in A + H atoms in B) = 0.40 mol\n*   n × (O atoms in A + O atoms in B) = 0.25 mol\n\nFrom these equations, the ratio of the total number of atoms in the combined formula unit (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. The most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). The H:N ratio in the ammonium ion is 4:1. In our combined formula, the H:N ratio is 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1. However, if we consider that we have two salt molecules, we can propose that each contains one ammonium cation, NH₄⁺.\n*   Two NH₄⁺ ions would account for N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting this from the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ leaves N₂O₅ for the two anions.\n*   We need to split N₂O₅ into two common oxyanions of nitrogen. The most plausible combination is the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻) and the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻).\n    *   NO₂⁻ + NO₃⁻ = N₂O₅²⁻ (in terms of atoms)\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃\n\n**Step 4: Verify the decomposition reactions and molar masses.**\nLet's check if this identification is consistent with all the data.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula N₂H₄O₂. Molar Mass = 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Decomposition: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula N₂H₄O₃. Molar Mass = 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Decomposition at higher temperatures: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). This simplifies to: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + ½O₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nNow, let's find the number of moles, n.\nTotal mass = n × (Molar Mass of A) + n × (Molar Mass of B) = 7.20 g\nn × (64 + 80) = 7.20\nn × 144 = 7.20\nn = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\nLet's check the products from this mixture:\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃: 0.05 mol N₂, (0.05 × ½) = 0.025 mol O₂, and (0.05 × 2) = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n\nTotal products:\n*   N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Correct)\n*   H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol (Correct)\n*   O₂ = 0.025 mol (Correct)\nAll calculated values match the experimental results.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nAlternatively, using the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ we found in Step 3:\nTotal atoms = 4 (N) + 8 (H) + 5 (O) = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe user has provided the same problem again. The previous reasoning and code execution have already confirmed the solution. I will reiterate the final steps of the reasoning.\n\n**1. Identification of Salts:**\nBased on the products of decomposition (H₂O, N₂O, and N₂), the salts were identified as ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n*   Decomposition of Salt A (NH₄NO₃): NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n*   Decomposition of Salt B (NH₄NO₂): NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n\n**2. Verification of Moles and Mass:**\nThe analysis of the gas mixture showed that 0.05 moles of N₂O and 0.05 moles of N₂ were produced. Since the initial mixture was equimolar, this means the original mixture contained 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.20 g\n*   Total Mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given information.\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Atoms:**\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the weight change of each tube to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Weight increase = mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ **0.2 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change.\n    *   This indicates that **no CO₂** or other acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all the tubes, a gas C remains.\n    *   Volume of gas C = 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.1 mol**.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, an alkaline solution, or hot copper. This suggests it is a relatively inert gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂), which is a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n### 2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts\n\nNow, let's determine the mass and moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original 7.20 g mixture by looking at the atoms in the products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.2 mol = **0.4 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming gas C is N₂.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.1 mol = **0.2 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.2 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.2 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.4 mol H × 1.008 g/mol) + (0.2 mol N × 14.007 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.00 g/mol)\n*   Mass ≈ 0.4032 g + 2.8014 g + 4.00 g = 7.2046 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g), confirming our calculations and the identity of gas C as N₂.\n\n### 3. Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states we have an **equimolar mixture** of two salts, A and B. This means if we have 'n' moles of salt A, we also have 'n' moles of salt B. The total amount of the mixture contains 0.2 mol N, 0.4 mol H, and 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe ratio of the atoms in the combined formula unit of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\nTo get an integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined empirical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are decomposition products containing N, H, and O, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions (like nitrate or nitrite). Let's try to find two such salts that sum to the formula N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** The chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** The chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n\nLet's add their formulas together:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A = Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B = Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts was passed through three tubes. Let's analyze the change in each tube to identify the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g, which is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The oxygen must have come from a gaseous oxide that is not acidic and reacts with hot copper. The two common possibilities are nitrous oxide (N₂O) or oxygen (O₂). However, the problem states that a gas C remained *after* this tube. If the gas were O₂, it would be consumed, and it's unlikely that the initial mixture contained elemental nitrogen. A more plausible scenario is the reaction of N₂O with copper: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. In this reaction, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms to form CuO.\n    *   Therefore, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms came from **0.05 mol of N₂O**. This reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   The volume of the remaining gas is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C is the nitrogen (N₂) that passed through all the tubes. It consists of any N₂ produced directly from the decomposition plus the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper.\n    *   Total N₂ = N₂ (original) + N₂ (from N₂O reaction)\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂ (original) + 0.05 mol\n    *   So, the amount of N₂ produced directly from the decomposition is **0.05 mol**.\n\nTo summarize, the decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B yielded:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n### 2. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products is:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.05 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 1.40 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.60 + 2.20 + 1.40 = 7.20 g\n\nThis total mass is equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture. This confirms that the salts decomposed completely into these gaseous products.\n\nThe salts A and B are in an equimolar mixture. Let's assume `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B were heated.\nThe overall reaction is:\n`n`A + `n`B → 0.05 N₂ + 0.05 N₂O + 0.20 H₂O\n\nDividing the product moles by the smallest value (0.05) gives a ratio of 1 N₂ : 1 N₂O : 4 H₂O.\nThis suggests that the decomposition of one mole of A and one mole of B produces 1 mole of N₂, 1 mole of N₂O, and 4 moles of H₂O.\nLet's look for two common nitrogen-containing salts whose decomposition products match this. The most common salts that produce these gases are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nIf we have an equimolar mixture of these two salts, their combined decomposition is:\nNH₄NO₂ + NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + N₂O + 4H₂O\n\nThis perfectly matches the 1:1:4 molar ratio of the products we deduced. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\nLet's verify the moles. The reaction `n`A + `n`B produced 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.05 mol of N₂O. This means `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * (64.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * (80.0 g/mol) = 4.00 g\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (or B): Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (or A): Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in NH₄NO₂) + (Atoms in NH₄NO₃) = 8 + 9 = **17 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂), a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nFrom the moles of the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 mol H/mol H₂O = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 mol N/mol N₂ = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is present in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 mol O/mol H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 mol O/mol O₂)\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n\nLet's check if the mass of these elements equals the initial mass of the mixture:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that salts A and B consist only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B. The total moles of elements are the sum from both salts.\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get integers, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   N: 1, H: 2, O: 1.25. Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of salt A and salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the compounds are salts containing N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts. We need to find two common ammonium salts that add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\nLet's try combining ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃ → Formula: N₂H₄O₃\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂ → Formula: N₂H₄O₂\n\nSum of formulas = (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This matches our derived ratio.\n\nNow, let's verify this with the decomposition reactions. The thermal decomposition of these salts at around 200°C produces the observed gases:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g) (This is the primary reaction, but at higher temperatures or with impurities, it can also produce N₂ and O₂). A more complete decomposition that fits the products is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + 4H₂O + O₂.\n\nLet's assume the reactions are:\n*   n NH₄NO₂ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O\n*   n NH₄NO₃ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O + 0.5n O₂\n\nTotal products would be:\n*   Moles of N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.5n\n\nFrom our initial analysis, we have 0.10 mol N₂, 0.20 mol H₂O, and 0.025 mol O₂.\n*   2n = 0.10 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   4n = 0.20 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   0.5n = 0.025 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n\nThe value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nFinally, we count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of the Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a mixture of salts and passing the resulting gases through a series of tubes. We can identify the gaseous products and their quantities by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). The problem states the weight of this tube did not change. This implies that no CO₂ (or other acidic gas) was formed during the decomposition. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper (Cu) reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight (0.80 g) is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the gas mixture passes through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remain. The volume is given at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. The most common inert gas produced in chemical decompositions of nitrogen-containing compounds is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts**\n\nLet's verify our product identification by checking the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass is exactly equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identified products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are correct and that the original salts A and B are composed only of the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ended up in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ended up in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen ended up in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo get all integers, we multiply the ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe problem states that the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means that the combined chemical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B must correspond to the empirical formula N₄H₈O₅.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are very likely to be ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻).\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated from the experimental data. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\n**Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data to identify the products and their quantities.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect and absorb acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the identity of gas C and verify the law of conservation of mass.**\n\nThe total mass of the initial salt mixture was 7.20 g. This must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of gas C:\n*   Molar mass of C = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nThe elements present in the products are H (from H₂O), O (from H₂O and O₂), and the elements from gas C. Since no CO₂ was formed, there is no carbon. A gas with a molar mass of ~28 g/mol that is inert under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂), with a molar mass of 2 * 14.007 = 28.014 g/mol. This is a perfect match.\n\nSo, the gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n\n**3. Determine the overall stoichiometry of the decomposition.**\n\nWe have the molar amounts of all products:\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.025 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol\n\nTo find the simplest whole-number ratio, we divide all values by the smallest value (0.025):\n*   N₂ : 0.10 / 0.025 = 4\n*   O₂ : 0.025 / 0.025 = 1\n*   H₂O : 0.20 / 0.025 = 8\n\nThe overall stoichiometric ratio of the products is 4N₂ : 1O₂ : 8H₂O.\n\n**4. Identify salts A and B.**\n\nThe original salts A and B decomposed to produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O. This means they must be composed of Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Hydrogen. Since they are salts, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions. The most common candidates are:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nLet's examine their decomposition reactions:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)  *(Note: This decomposition occurs at higher temperatures, consistent with the production of O₂)*\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of A and B. Let's assume we have `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produces: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produces: `n` moles of N₂, `n/2` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `n/2`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nThe molar ratio of the products from this mixture is (2n) : (n/2) : (4n). Multiplying by 2 to clear the fraction gives 4 : 1 : 8. This perfectly matches the ratio we derived from the experimental data. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**5. Calculate the number of atoms.**\n\nNow we can find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (e.g., Ammonium Nitrate): NH₄NO₃**\n    *   Number of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₃⁻) = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen (O) atoms = 3\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (e.g., Ammonium Nitrite): NH₄NO₂**\n    *   Number of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₂⁻) = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen (O) atoms = 2\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n*   Total atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nTo be certain, we can quickly verify the initial mass using the value of `n`. From the product data, we know that 0.025 moles of O₂ were produced.\n*   Moles of O₂ = `n/2` = 0.025 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   So, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Mass(NH₄NO₃) = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.002 g\n*   Mass(NH₄NO₂) = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g\n*   Total mass = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given 7.20 g.\n\nThe reasoning is consistent and all data points are satisfied.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the decomposition products to deduce the composition of the original salts.\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe gas mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through three tubes. The change in weight of each tube tells us what was absorbed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of H₂O produced is 3.60 g.\n    *   To find the moles of water, we use its molar mass (≈18.0 g/mol).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: it means **no CO₂ was produced**. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain the element Carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO). The increase in the tube's mass is due to the captured oxygen.\n    *   The mass of O₂ produced is 0.80 g.\n    *   To find the moles of oxygen, we use its molar mass (32.0 g/mol).\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper, and we know the salts don't contain carbon, the most plausible identity for this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nLet's verify our product identification by checking the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Products** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**\n\nThis total mass perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms our products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are correct and that the original salts A and B are composed only of the elements **Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O)**.\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ended up in N₂. Moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol N**.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ended up in H₂O. Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol H**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen ended up in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have the molar ratio of the elements in the entire mixture: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\n*   N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n*   N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe problem states that the initial substance was an **equimolar mixture** of two salts, A and B. This means the combined chemical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B must be **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are very likely to be ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻). Let's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are **ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a classic stoichiometry problem that can be solved by carefully analyzing the products of the thermal decomposition. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed and passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the mass change of each tube to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the weight of this tube did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of the tube (0.80 g) is the mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is non-reactive towards water absorbers, bases, and hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Volume of N₂ = 2.24 L\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n\n### 2. Verify Mass Conservation and Identify the Salts\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products should equal the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.1 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Gases** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g\n\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture perfectly, confirming our analysis of the products is correct. The decomposition of salts A and B yields H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen points towards ammonium salts, and the presence of oxygen suggests nitrate or nitrite anions.\n\nLet's examine the decomposition of likely candidates:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes to produce nitrogen and water:\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Its decomposition can be complex. While it often produces N₂O and H₂O, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, it can decompose to nitrogen, oxygen, and water:\n    2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states it's an equimolar mixture. Let's assume salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate. Let 'x' be the number of moles for each salt.\n*   From `x` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `x` moles of N₂ and `2x` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `x` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `x` moles of N₂, `0.5x` moles of O₂, and `2x` moles of H₂O (based on the second reaction, per mole of NH₄NO₃).\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = x + x = 2x\n*   Total H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5x\n\nThe molar ratio of the products is N₂ : H₂O : O₂ = 2x : 4x : 0.5x, which simplifies to **4 : 8 : 1**.\n\nLet's compare this to the experimental ratio from Step 1:\n*   N₂ : H₂O : O₂ = 0.1 mol : 0.2 mol : 0.025 mol\n*   Dividing by the smallest value (0.025), we get the ratio **4 : 8 : 1**.\n\nThe ratios match perfectly. Therefore, the salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts was passed through a series of tubes, and the change in mass of each tube tells us what gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of this tube increased by 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂) or sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which would form a precipitate. The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n### **2. Identifying the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe decomposition produced water, a non-reactive gas (C), and an oxygen-containing gas that reacted with copper. The presence of nitrogen in many thermally unstable salts, along with the products, suggests the gases are related to nitrogen compounds.\n\n*   The most common non-reactive gas produced in such decompositions is nitrogen (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n*   The oxygen-containing gas that reacted with copper (providing 0.05 mol of O atoms) and would likely produce N₂ as a byproduct is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   From this reaction, 0.05 moles of N₂O would produce the 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms that formed CuO. This reaction would also produce 0.05 moles of N₂.\n*   The total amount of N₂ (Gas C) collected was 0.10 mol. Since 0.05 mol of N₂ came from the reaction of N₂O with copper, the other 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been produced directly from the initial decomposition.\n\nSo, the gases formed by heating the salts were:\n*   **0.20 mol of H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂**\n\n### **3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂O, and N₂) are characteristic of the thermal decomposition of specific ammonium salts.\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) yields nitrous oxide and water: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O.\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) yields nitrogen gas and water: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nLet's assume Salt A is **NH₄NO₃** and Salt B is **NH₄NO₂**. The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar (contained an equal number of moles of each salt). Let's verify if this matches our findings.\n\n*   Let 'x' be the moles of each salt.\n*   Decomposition of x moles of NH₄NO₃ produces x moles of N₂O and 2x moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of x moles of NH₄NO₂ produces x moles of N₂ and 2x moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Moles of N₂O = x\n*   Moles of N₂ = x\n*   Moles of H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x\n\nFrom our analysis in step 2, we found:\n*   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol  => x = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol   => x = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol  => 4x = 4(0.05) = 0.20 mol\n\nThe values are consistent. Therefore, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\nLet's check the initial mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Separation Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture from the changes in weight of these tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase is 3.60 g, which is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change (Δm = 0).\n    *   This means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed, confirming this reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, a gas C remains.\n    *   Volume at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe total mass of the initial salts was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\nTotal mass of gases = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n7.20 g = 4.40 g + Mass(Gas C)\nMass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\nMolar Mass(Gas C) = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nGas C is inert to the reagents in the tubes and has a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol. The most common gas fitting this description is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nThe elements in the gaseous products (N, H, O) must have originated from the initial salts A and B. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles H = 2 × Moles H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂.\n    *   Moles O = (1 × Moles H₂O) + (2 × Moles O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles N = 2 × Moles N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\nSo, the total elemental mole ratio in the 7.20 g mixture is N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get a simpler integer ratio, we can multiply by 20: N:H:O = 4 : 8 : 5.\nThe combined empirical formula of the salt mixture is N₄H₈O₅.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means the total number of moles of A is equal to the total number of moles of B. Let this be 'n' moles for each. The combined formula (A+B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nThe salts contain N, H, and O. A very common cation containing N and H is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms in the combined formula can be accounted for by two NH₄⁺ ions (one for each salt).\n*   Salt A = NH₄⁺ + Anion A⁻\n*   Salt B = NH₄⁺ + Anion B⁻\n\nThe remaining atoms to form the two anions are N₂O₅ (from N₄H₈O₅ - 2×NH₄). We need to split N₂O₅ into two anions, each with a -1 charge. The most common and chemically sensible anions from these atoms are:\n*   Nitrite ion: NO₂⁻\n*   Nitrate ion: NO₃⁻\nAdding these together gives N₂O₅²⁻, which balances the two NH₄⁺ cations.\n\nSo, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\nLet's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these salts matches the observed products.\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   A known decomposition for NH₄NO₃ at ~200°C is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + 4H₂O + O₂ (or NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 2H₂O + ½ O₂)\n\nLet's assume the mixture contained 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   Products from NH₄NO₂: n mol N₂, 2n mol H₂O\n*   Products from NH₄NO₃: n mol N₂, 2n mol H₂O, 0.5n mol O₂\n*   Total products:\n    *   N₂: n + n = 2n\n    *   H₂O: 2n + 2n = 4n\n    *   O₂: 0.5n\n\nFrom our initial analysis, we found: Moles N₂ = 0.10, Moles H₂O = 0.20, Moles O₂ = 0.025.\n*   2n = 0.10 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n*   4n = 0.20 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n*   0.5n = 0.025 mol => n = 0.05 mol\n\nThe results are consistent, confirming our hypothesis. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. The total mass is (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) = 3.2 g + 4.0 g = 7.2 g, which matches the given information.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the problem statement and chemical principles.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed upon heating the salts and is then passed through a series of tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent, used to absorb water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g is equal to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, indicating the absence of CO₂ or other acidic gases (like SO₂ or most nitrogen oxides).\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper**\n    *   Hot copper can react with oxygen or oxygen-containing compounds like nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form copper oxide (CuO).\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (Gas C) remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, an alkali solution, or hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Identifying the Gaseous Products of Decomposition\n\nFrom the analysis above, we need to identify the initial gases produced by heating the salts. The gases contained 0.20 mol of H₂O, 0.10 mol of N₂, and a gas that supplied 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms to the hot copper.\n\nThe gas that reacted with copper was likely nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is:\nN₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO\n\nThis reaction explains the observations perfectly:\n*   It provides the 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms that caused the 0.80 g mass increase in tube №3.\n*   For this to happen, 0.05 mol of N₂O must have been present in the initial gas mixture.\n*   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n\nThe total amount of N₂ gas (Gas C) collected at the end was 0.10 mol. Since 0.05 mol of this N₂ came from the decomposition of N₂O in tube №3, the other 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been present in the original gas mixture from the start.\n\nTherefore, the thermal decomposition of salts A and B produced:\n*   **0.20 mol of H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂**\n\n### 3. Identifying Salts A and B\n\nThe salts decomposed completely into a mixture of H₂O, N₂O, and N₂. This composition points towards ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen. The two most common salts that produce these gases upon heating are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. Let's assume *n* moles of salt A and *n* moles of salt B were heated.\n*   From *n* moles of NH₄NO₃, we get *n* moles of N₂O and 2*n* moles of H₂O.\n*   From *n* moles of NH₄NO₂, we get *n* moles of N₂ and 2*n* moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products would be:\n*   Moles of N₂O = *n*\n*   Moles of N₂ = *n*\n*   Moles of H₂O = 2*n* + 2*n* = 4*n*\n\nComparing this with our findings from the gas analysis:\n*   Moles of N₂O = *n* = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂ = *n* = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 4*n* = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol\n\nThe results are perfectly consistent, confirming that the mixture contained 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂.\n\n### 4. Verifying the Initial Mass\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 80.06 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 64.06 g/mol\n\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol × 80.06 g/mol = 4.003 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol × 64.06 g/mol = 3.203 g\n*   Total Mass = 4.003 g + 3.203 g = 7.206 g\n\nThis matches the initial weight of 7.20 g.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in one molecule of each.\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** First, we'll use the information from the experiment to determine the chemical nature and quantity (in moles) of the gases produced by heating the salt mixture.\n    *   The weight increase in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   The weight increase in the tube with red-hot copper corresponds to the mass of oxygen (O₂) produced.\n    *   The fact that the Ca(OH)₂ tube's weight did not change means no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced.\n    *   The remaining gas, C, which is inert to all previous traps, is most likely nitrogen (N₂). We can calculate its moles from the given volume at STP.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reactants (Salts A and B):** Based on the products (H₂O, O₂, N₂), we can deduce the original salts. The absence of a solid residue and the production of these specific gases strongly suggest the decomposition of two ammonium salts:\n    *   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes to N₂ + 2H₂O.\n    *   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Decomposes to N₂ + 0.5 O₂ + 2H₂O (this is one of its decomposition pathways, which fits the products).\n\n3.  **Verify with Stoichiometry:** We'll assume the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃ and that they were in an equimolar mixture. We can calculate the moles of each salt (`n`) using the moles of any of the products (e.g., N₂). Then, we will use this value of `n` to predict the quantities of the other products (O₂ and H₂O) and the total initial mass of the mixture. If our predictions match the experimental data, our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Once salts A and B are confirmed to be NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃, we will count the number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt. The sum of these two numbers will be our final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define given data and constants\nmass_h2o = 3.60  # g, from tube #1\nmass_o2 = 0.80   # g, from tube #3\nvolume_gas_c = 2.24  # L at STP, this is N2 gas\n\nMOLAR_MASS_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nMOLAR_MASS_O2 = 31.998   # g/mol\nMOLAR_VOLUME_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\n\n# Step 2: Calculate moles of products\n# The problem states that the final remaining gas is 2.24 L.\n# Based on the likely reactions, this inert gas is Nitrogen (N2).\nmoles_n2 = volume_gas_c / MOLAR_VOLUME_STP\n\n# We hypothesize the salts are Ammonium Nitrite (A) and Ammonium Nitrate (B),\n# as their decomposition produces the observed gases (N2, H2O, O2) without solid residue.\n# Reaction A: NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2H2O\n# Reaction B: 2NH4NO3 -> 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O (or per mole: NH4NO3 -> N2 + 0.5*O2 + 2*H2O)\n\n# Step 3: Use stoichiometry to find the moles of the original salts\n# The mixture is equimolar, so moles of A = moles of B = n.\n# Total moles of N2 produced = n (from A) + n (from B) = 2n\n# So, 2 * n = moles_n2\nn = moles_n2 / 2\n\n# We can verify this value of 'n' using the other products.\n# Predicted moles of O2 = 0.5 * n (only from B)\npredicted_mass_o2 = (0.5 * n) * MOLAR_MASS_O2\n\n# Predicted moles of H2O = 2*n (from A) + 2*n (from B) = 4*n\npredicted_mass_h2o = (4 * n) * MOLAR_MASS_H2O\n\n# We check if our calculated masses match the experimental data.\n# Note: due to rounding of molar masses, the result might be a close approximation.\n# moles_n2 is 0.1, so n is 0.05.\n# predicted_mass_o2 = 0.5 * 0.05 * 31.998 = 0.79995 g (~0.80 g) -> Match!\n# predicted_mass_h2o = 4 * 0.05 * 18.015 = 3.603 g (~3.60 g) -> Match!\n\n# Since the product amounts match, our identification of the salts is correct.\n# Salt A = NH4NO2 (Ammonium Nitrite)\n# Salt B = NH4NO3 (Ammonium Nitrate)\n\n# Step 4: Count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n# Atoms in Salt A (NH4NO2):\n# N: 1 (in NH4) + 1 (in NO2) = 2\n# H: 4\n# O: 2\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Atoms in Salt B (NH4NO3):\n# N: 1 (in NH4) + 1 (in NO3) = 2\n# H: 4\n# O: 3\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# The total number of atoms is the sum of atoms in one unit of A and one unit of B.\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(\"The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is:\")\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is:\n17\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the gas treatment process to identify the decomposition products.**\nThe mixture of gases formed from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. We analyze the results from each tube to identify the components of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent (desiccant) that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g. This means the mass of water produced is 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to test for acidic gases, most commonly CO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, it means there were no acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ in the mixture. This tells us the original salts do not contain carbon or sulfur that would form these oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases containing oxygen, such as O₂, N₂O, or NO. The problem states that CuO is formed, and the mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the previous reagents. Given that we are dealing with nitrogen-containing salts, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Reconstruct the gas mixture before it entered Tube №3.**\nThe gas entering Tube №3 was a mixture of the oxidizing gas and the inert Gas C (N₂). The reaction in Tube №3 removed 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. The gas leaving the tube was 0.10 mol of N₂. Let's consider the possible oxidizing gas.\n\nA very common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts that reacts with hot copper is nitrous oxide (N₂O).\nReaction: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂\n*   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms to form CuO, we must have started with 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n*   The reaction of 0.05 mol of N₂O also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The total N₂ collected at the end is 0.10 mol. This total consists of the N₂ produced in the reaction (0.05 mol) and any N₂ that was present in the original gas mixture and passed through unreacted.\n*   Initial N₂ = Total N₂ - Produced N₂ = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the gas mixture produced from the initial decomposition consisted of:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n**Step 3: Identify the salts A and B.**\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B was heated. Let's assume we have `x` moles of salt A and `x` moles of salt B. We need to find two salts whose decomposition in a 1:1 molar ratio produces the calculated amounts of gases. Common ammonium salts that decompose into these products are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Salt A = Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** The decomposition reaction is NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O.\n*   **Salt B = Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** The decomposition reaction is NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nIf we start with `x` moles of each:\n*   `x` mol NH₄NO₃ produces `x` mol N₂O and `2x` mol H₂O.\n*   `x` mol NH₄NO₂ produces `x` mol N₂ and `2x` mol H₂O.\n\nThe total products would be:\n*   `x` mol of N₂O\n*   `x` mol of N₂\n*   `2x + 2x = 4x` mol of H₂O\n\nComparing this to our findings from Step 2:\n*   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol  => `x` = 0.05\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol  => `x` = 0.05\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol  => `4x` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\nThe results are perfectly consistent with `x = 0.05`. Therefore, the initial mixture was 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the total mass.**\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01*2 + 1.008*4 + 16.00*3 = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01*2 + 1.008*4 + 16.00*2 = 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol ≈ 4.00 g.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol ≈ 3.20 g.\n*   Total mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given total mass, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nThe reasoning and thinking process has been successfully completed, and the calculations have been verified by the Python code execution. The steps were:\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data** to determine the products of the decomposition and their molar quantities.\n    *   The mass increase in the Mg(ClO₄)₂ tube (3.60 g) corresponds to 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   The lack of mass change in the Ca(OH)₂ tube indicates no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed.\n    *   The mass increase in the hot copper tube (0.80 g) corresponds to 0.025 mol of O₂.\n    *   The remaining gas volume (2.24 L at STP) corresponds to 0.10 mol of an inert gas, identified as N₂.\n2.  **Verify the product masses** against the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). The sum of the masses of H₂O (3.60 g), O₂ (0.80 g), and N₂ (2.80 g) equals 7.20 g, confirming the product identification.\n3.  **Deduce the identity of the salts**. Based on the product elements (H, N, O) and the fact that they are salts, ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) were hypothesized.\n4.  **Write the decomposition reactions** and test the hypothesis using the \"equimolar mixture\" condition.\n    *   Reaction 1: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Reaction 2: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n    *   It was calculated that an equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ would produce the exact quantities of N₂, O₂, and H₂O observed experimentally. This confirms that salts A and B are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n5.  **Calculate the final answer**. The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the mass changes in the tubes**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were formed.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the remaining gas C**\n\n*   A total of 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n*   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n*   The total initial mass of the salt mixture was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert to the reagents used is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the elemental composition of the initial mixture**\n\nThe gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The atoms in these products must have come from the initial salts A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** from 0.2 mol of H₂O = 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** from 0.1 mol of N₂ = 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** from 0.2 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ = (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives N₈H₁₆O₁₀, or more simply, multiply by 4 (the inverse of the smallest fraction 0.25) to clear the decimal which gives N₄H₈O₅.\n\n### **Step 4: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts. The combined chemical formula is N₄H₈O₅. The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen strongly suggests the presence of the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺).\n\n*   The H₈ part of the formula corresponds to two ammonium ions: 2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈²⁺.\n*   The remaining atoms are N₂O₅. These must form the anions.\n*   The most common nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions) are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   The sum of these two anions is (NO₃⁻) + (NO₂⁻) = N₂O₅²⁻.\n*   Combining the cations and anions, we get the two salts: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nSo, Salt A is **NH₄NO₃** and Salt B is **NH₄NO₂**.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₃⁻) = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₂⁻) = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts =** Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water. The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). The fact that its weight did not change indicates that no CO₂ was produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After the removal of water and oxygen, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Given the starting materials are salts, this inert gas is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nFrom the products, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol H\n*   **Oxygen (O):** (moles of H₂O) + 2 × (moles of O₂) = 0.2 mol + 2 × 0.025 mol = 0.25 mol O\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol N\n\nThe total mass of the products is (3.60 g H₂O) + (0.80 g O₂) + (0.1 mol × 28.02 g/mol N₂) = 7.20 g, which matches the initial mass of the salts.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that the initial substance is an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, and that only gases are formed upon heating. The absence of a solid residue suggests the salts do not contain metal cations. The most plausible cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The anions must be composed of nitrogen and oxygen.\n\nLet's look at the molar ratio of the elements in the mixture: N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.05, which is half the moles of N₂), which gives N₄H₈O₅.\n\nSince we have an equimolar (1:1) mixture of two salts, A and B, the combined formula (A + B) must be N₄H₈O₅. The presence of 8 hydrogen atoms suggests two ammonium (NH₄⁺) cations in total, one for each salt. The remaining atoms, N₂O₅, must form the two anions. The most common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n*   Anion 1: NO₂⁻\n*   Anion 2: NO₃⁻\n\nCombining these with the ammonium cation gives the two salts:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nLet's check the combined formula: NH₄NO₂ + NH₄NO₃ = N₂H₄O₂ + N₂H₄O₃ = N₄H₈O₅. This matches our derived composition. The decomposition of ammonium nitrite produces nitrogen and water (NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O). The decomposition of ammonium nitrate at around 200°C can produce nitrous oxide and water (NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O) or, at slightly higher temperatures, nitrogen, oxygen, and water (2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O). Both decomposition pathways for ammonium nitrate are consistent with the experimental data, as any N₂O produced would also react with the hot copper to yield N₂ and CuO.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 (in Salt A) + 9 (in Salt B) = 17 atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the products of the thermal decomposition.**\n\nThe gaseous mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes, allowing us to identify the components and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no acidic gases like CO₂ or NO₂ were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent and reacts with oxidizing gases like oxygen (O₂) or nitrogen oxides (e.g., N₂O, NO). The reaction forms copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that combined with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the previous reagents, which strongly suggests it is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g) by the law of conservation of mass. We can find the mass of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles from H₂O) + (moles from reaction with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.00 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen, as no other elements are indicated.\n    *   Mass of N = Total mass - Mass of H - Mass of O = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.01 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n**3. Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe problem states that A and B are salts and form an equimolar mixture. Since the elements are N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. A salt consists of a cation and an anion.\n\n*   The cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺).\n*   Let's check if the salts each contain one ammonium ion. An equimolar mixture of NH₄⁺A⁻ and NH₄⁺B⁻ would have a combined formula of N₂H₈(A'B').\n*   Our elemental mole ratio for the entire mixture is H:N:O = 0.40:0.20:0.25. To get integers, we multiply by 20, which gives H₈N₄O₅.\n*   The formula for the combined pair of salt molecules (A+B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n*   If we assume both salts have one NH₄⁺ cation, we use N₂H₈ for the cations. The remaining atoms for the two anions are N₂O₅.\n*   We need to split N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-based anions. The logical choices are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   Anion 1: NO₂⁻ (uses 1 N, 2 O)\n    *   Anion 2: NO₃⁻ (uses 1 N, 3 O)\n    *   Total atoms used in anions: 2 N, 5 O. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Verify with the decomposition reactions.**\n\nLet's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these salts matches the observed products. The standard thermal decompositions are:\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n\nSince the mixture is equimolar, let's say we have `n` moles of each. The overall reaction is:\n`n`NH₄NO₂ + `n`NH₄NO₃ → `n`N₂ + `n`N₂O + 4`n`H₂O\n\nFrom our analysis, we found 0.20 mol of H₂O was produced.\n*   4`n` = 0.20 mol ⇒ `n` = 0.05 mol.\n\nThis means the decomposition produced:\n*   `n` = 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   `n` = 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n*   4`n` = 0.20 mol of H₂O (which is 3.6 g).\n\nNow let's trace the gases through the tubes:\n*   The N₂O gas (0.05 mol) reacts with the hot copper. It contains 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms (mass = 0.05 * 16 = 0.80 g), matching the mass gain of tube №3. The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This produces another 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The final gas C is the sum of the original N₂ and the N₂ produced from N₂O: 0.05 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.10 mol N₂. This matches the 2.24 L of remaining gas.\n*   Let's check the initial mass:\n    *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ (molar mass ≈ 64 g/mol) = 0.05 × 64 = 3.20 g.\n    *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (molar mass ≈ 80 g/mol) = 0.05 × 80 = 4.00 g.\n    *   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given total weight.\n\nThe identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the information from the gas purification train.**\n    The mixture of gases formed from the decomposition of salts A and B is passed through three tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H2O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of H2O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H2O = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H2O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO2 or SO2. Since the weight of the tube did not change, we can conclude that no such acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent and will react with oxidizing gases. The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This increase is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that combined with the copper to form copper oxide (CuO).\n        *   Molar mass of oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = mass / molar mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        The oxidizing gas must have provided these 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms. Common oxidizing gases containing N and O are N2O or NO. The reaction with N2O is `Cu + N2O -> CuO + N2`. The reaction with O2 is `2Cu + O2 -> 2CuO`.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        This gas C is inert to all the reagents, which strongly suggests it is dinitrogen (N2).\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n    The salts A and B decomposed completely into gases. By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass and elemental composition of the gaseous products must be the same as the initial 7.20 g salt mixture. The products contain hydrogen (from H2O), oxygen (from H2O and the oxidizing gas), and nitrogen (from the final gas C and possibly the oxidizing gas).\n\n    Let's find the total moles of each element in the gaseous products.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in H2O. Moles of H = 2 * moles of H2O = 2 * 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in H2O and the oxidizing gas. Moles of O = (moles of O in H2O) + (moles of O that reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** To find the moles of Nitrogen, we must first identify the oxidizing gas. Let's assume it's nitrous oxide (N2O), as this is a common decomposition product of ammonium salts.\n        *   Reaction in tube 3: `N2O + Cu -> CuO + N2`.\n        *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we must have started with 0.05 mol of N2O.\n        *   This reaction produces 0.05 mol of N2.\n        *   The total final N2 (gas C) is 0.10 mol. This means that in addition to the N2 produced from the N2O reaction, there must have been 0.05 mol of N2 in the initial gas mixture.\n        *   So, the original decomposition products were: 0.20 mol H2O, 0.05 mol N2O, and 0.05 mol N2.\n    *   Let's check the total mass of these products:\n        *   Mass = (0.20 mol * 18.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 28.0 g/mol)\n        *   Mass = 3.60 g + 2.20 g + 1.40 g = 7.20 g.\n        This matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our product identification.\n    *   Now, we can find the total moles of Nitrogen (N):\n        *   Moles of N = (2 * moles of N2O) + (2 * moles of N2) = (2 * 0.05) + (2 * 0.05) = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n\n3.  **Determine the combined formula of salts A and B.**\n    The initial 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol of H, 0.20 mol of N, and 0.25 mol of O. The molar ratio of the elements is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25.\n    To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\n    H : N : O = (0.40 * 20) : (0.20 * 20) : (0.25 * 20) = 8 : 4 : 5.\n    The empirical formula for the combined salts is H8N4O5.\n\n    The problem states we have an equimolar mixture of A and B. This means that the formula H8N4O5 represents the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    Formula(A) + Formula(B) = H8N4O5.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is the total number of atoms in the combined formula H8N4O5.\n    *   Total atoms = (number of H atoms) + (number of N atoms) + (number of O atoms)\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 4 + 5 = 17.\n\n*(Self-check: We can identify the salts A and B that fit this description. The decomposition products (N2, N2O, H2O) suggest ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\nSalt A: Ammonium nitrate, NH4NO3 (Formula: H4N2O3). Atoms = 4(H) + 2(N) + 3(O) = 9.\nSalt B: Ammonium nitrite, NH4NO2 (Formula: H4N2O2). Atoms = 4(H) + 2(N) + 2(O) = 8.\nCombined formula = H(4+4)N(2+2)O(3+2) = H8N4O5. This matches our derived formula.\nTotal atoms = Atoms(A) + Atoms(B) = 9 + 8 = 17. The result is consistent.)*\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental results to identify and quantify the gaseous products.**\n    *   The mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases (\"only a mixture of gases was formed\").\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect and absorb acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂). The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change. This is a critical piece of information, indicating that no CO₂ was present in the gas mixture.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n        *   The mass gain is the mass of oxygen atoms. Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) is 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, a base, or hot copper. This strongly suggests it is a relatively inert gas, like nitrogen (N₂), which is a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts. Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the gaseous products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B. Let's sum up the moles of each element produced:\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O → 0.20 mol × 2 = 0.40 mol of H atoms.\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ → (0.20 mol × 1) + (0.025 mol × 2) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol of O atoms.\n        *   **Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂ → 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol of N atoms.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the mass of these elements to see if it matches the initial mass:\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n        *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n        *   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   The calculated mass perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture. This confirms that salts A and B are composed solely of hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.\n\n3.  **Identify salts A and B.**\n    *   The problem states that A and B form an equimolar mixture.\n    *   The decomposition products (N₂, H₂O, O₂) and the absence of CO₂ or solid residue are characteristic of the thermal decomposition of certain ammonium salts. Let's consider two common ones:\n        *   Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂: Its decomposition is NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n        *   Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃: Its decomposition can vary with temperature. A known reaction is 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n    *   Let's hypothesize that salt A is NH₄NO₂ and salt B is NH₄NO₃. We can test this hypothesis.\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, so let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n    *   The total mass of the mixture is n × (M_A + M_B) = n × (64 + 80) = 144n.\n    *   We know the total mass is 7.20 g: 144n = 7.20 g → n = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n    *   Let's calculate the expected products from this mixture:\n        *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: produces 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 × 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n        *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 reaction): produces (2/2)×0.05 = 0.05 mol N₂, (1/2)×0.05 = 0.025 mol O₂, and (4/2)×0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n    *   Total products expected:\n        *   Total N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol.\n        *   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol.\n        *   Total H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n    *   These calculated amounts exactly match the amounts determined from the experimental data. Therefore, the salts A and B are indeed ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.**\n    *   The question asks for the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 nitrogen atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 nitrogen atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 19\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 15\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data to identify the gaseous products and their quantities.**\n    The problem describes the heating of a mixture of two salts, A and B, and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g. This means 3.60 g of H₂O was produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO), via the reaction 2Cu(s) + O₂(g) → 2CuO(s). The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted. The mass increased by 0.80 g.\n        *   This mass increase is the mass of oxygen (O) atoms.\n        *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas exists as diatomic molecules (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ gas = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** The gas that did not react in any of the tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas is inert to a drying agent, a basic solution, and hot copper. This chemical behavior strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂), a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n    The gaseous products were H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This implies that the original salts A and B are composed of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). We can now calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n    *   **Total moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H atoms from the salts formed 0.20 mol of H₂O. Since each H₂O molecule contains 2 H atoms:\n        *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   **Total moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N atoms formed 0.10 mol of N₂. Since each N₂ molecule contains 2 N atoms:\n        *   Total moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Total moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are found in both the H₂O and O₂ produced.\n        *   Total moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O in O₂)\n        *   Total moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n    *   **Mass Verification:** Let's confirm that the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g).\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n        *   Total mass = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B.**\n    The problem states we have an \"equimolar mixture\" of salts A and B. This means that if we take one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B, their combined elemental formula must have the molar ratio we just calculated.\n    *   Molar ratio of elements in (A + B): N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n    *   To convert this to the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply all numbers by 20:\n        *   N: 0.20 × 20 = 4\n        *   H: 0.40 × 20 = 8\n        *   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n    *   Therefore, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n    We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that, when added together, give this formula. The most common ions are ammonium (NH₄⁺), nitrate (NO₃⁻), and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's try combining them:\n    *   Let Salt A be Ammonium Nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Let Salt B be Ammonium Nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\n    Let's check if their combined formula matches our derived formula:\n    (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N(₂₊₂)H(₄₊₄)O(₃₊₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    This is a perfect match. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n\n    *   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total atoms = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze what each tube tells us about the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** The mass increased by 3.60 g. Magnesium perchlorate is a powerful drying agent, which means it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** The mass of this tube did not change. Calcium hydroxide solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂, which would react to form a precipitate and increase the mass of the tube (e.g., CO₂ + Ca(OH)₂ → CaCO₃(s) + H₂O). The fact that the mass did not change strongly implies that no acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. This indicates that the gas mixture contained an oxidizing agent that reacted with copper. The mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Common gases from salt decomposition that can oxidize hot copper are O₂, N₂O, or NO. The oxygen atoms in these gases are the source of the mass increase.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained (at standard temperature and pressure, STP). This gas must be inert to all the previous reagents (Mg(ClO₄)₂, Ca(OH)₂, hot Cu).\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   A common inert gas produced in the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Deduce the Composition of the Initial Gas Mixture**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the initial gaseous products were H₂O, an oxidizing gas containing 0.05 mol of oxygen, and an inert gas which is likely N₂. Let's identify the oxidizing gas.\n\n*   Consider the decomposition of common nitrogen-containing salts. They often produce N₂ and N₂O. Let's hypothesize that the oxidizing gas is nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n    *   The reaction with copper is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n    *   This reaction provides one oxygen atom per molecule of N₂O.\n    *   Since 0.05 mol of O atoms reacted, there must have been **0.05 mol of N₂O**.\n    *   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n*   Now let's account for the final gas C (0.1 mol of N₂). This total amount of N₂ is the sum of N₂ produced directly from the salt decomposition and the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper.\n    *   Total N₂ = (Initial N₂) + (N₂ from N₂O reaction)\n    *   0.1 mol = (Initial N₂) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Initial N₂ = 0.1 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\nSo, the original mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was:\n*   **0.2 mol of H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂**\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe are looking for an equimolar mixture of two salts (A and B) that decompose upon heating to produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O in a 0.05 : 0.05 : 0.2 molar ratio (which simplifies to 1 : 1 : 4).\n\nLet's consider the decomposition of common ammonium salts:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nIf we have an equimolar mixture of these two salts, let's say 'n' moles of each:\n*   n NH₄NO₂ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O\n*   n NH₄NO₃ → n N₂O + 2n H₂O\n\nThe total products would be:\n*   n moles of N₂\n*   n moles of N₂O\n*   2n + 2n = 4n moles of H₂O\n\nThe molar ratio of the products (N₂ : N₂O : H₂O) is n : n : 4n, which simplifies to 1 : 1 : 4. This perfectly matches the ratio we deduced from the experimental data.\n\nTherefore, the salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Verify with Mass Data**\n\nFrom our product analysis, we found that n = 0.05 mol. Let's check if 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass, confirming our identification of the salts and their quantities.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their chemical formulas.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe detailed chemical analysis provided in the prompt allows for a step-by-step deduction of the identities of salts A and B.\n\n### Analysis of Gaseous Products\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent used to absorb water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂). The fact that the weight of the tube did not change indicates that no acidic gases were present in the mixture produced by the decomposition.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of the tube (0.80 g) corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted to form copper oxide (CuO).\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol\n    *   Since the gas is O₂, moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol\n\n4.  **Gas C (Remaining gas):** The remaining gas C has a volume of 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP), which corresponds to:\n    *   Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the products equals the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g). We can find the mass of gas C:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n\nNow, we can determine the molar mass of gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is inert to the reagents used is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe decomposition of the salt mixture produced H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This indicates the original salts were composed of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. As no solid residue was left, this points towards ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxoacids. The most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's examine their decomposition reactions:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** At temperatures around 200-250°C, the decomposition is 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). At lower temperatures, it primarily produces N₂O and H₂O. Given the products, the higher temperature decomposition is the relevant reaction.\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let's assume the mixture consists of `x` moles of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and `x` moles of salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe total moles of products would be:\n*   **From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂:** `x` mol N₂ + `2x` mol H₂O\n*   **From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃:** `x` mol N₂ + `0.5x` mol O₂ + `2x` mol H₂O\n\nThe total moles of each product from the mixture are:\n*   **Total N₂:** `x` + `x` = `2x`\n*   **Total H₂O:** `2x` + `2x` = `4x`\n*   **Total O₂:** `0.5x`\n\nThe ratio of the product moles is H₂O : N₂ : O₂ = `4x` : `2x` : `0.5x`, which simplifies to 8 : 4 : 1.\n\nLet's compare this to the experimental moles we calculated:\n*   n(H₂O) = 0.2 mol\n*   n(N₂) = 0.1 mol\n*   n(O₂) = 0.025 mol\n\nThe experimental ratio is 0.2 : 0.1 : 0.025, which also simplifies to 8 : 4 : 1. The perfect match confirms our hypothesis.\n\nNow, we can find the value of `x`:\n*   Using O₂: `0.5x` = 0.025 mol  => `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   Using N₂: `2x` = 0.1 mol => `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   Using H₂O: `4x` = 0.2 mol => `x` = 0.05 mol\n\nAll calculations consistently show that the mixture contained 0.05 moles of each salt.\n\nAs a final check, let's calculate the initial mass:\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol) = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### Calculation of Total Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 (from A) + 9 (from B) = 17 atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the mass changes in the tubes to identify the gaseous products.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase is due to the oxygen.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n**2. Identify the final remaining gas C.**\n\n*   Volume of gas C = 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n*   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n*   The total initial mass of the salts was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Total Mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(C)\n    *   Mass(C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n*   Now, we can find the molar mass of gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Determine the empirical formula of the combined salts.**\n\nThe decomposition produced 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂. Let's find the total moles of each element present in the original mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** 0.2 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.4 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** 0.1 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = 0.2 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** (0.2 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 O/O₂) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the initial mixture is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n*   N: 0.2 × 20 = 4\n*   H: 0.4 × 20 = 8\n*   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n\nSo, the combined empirical formula for (Salt A + Salt B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe problem states that A and B are salts in an equimolar mixture. We need to split the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   The presence of 8 hydrogen atoms strongly suggests two ammonium cations (NH₄⁺), which would account for 2 N and 8 H atoms.\n*   The remaining atoms are N₂O₅ (N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈). These must form the two anions for the salts.\n*   To balance the charge of the two NH₄⁺ cations (2 x +1 = +2), the two anions must have a total charge of -2.\n*   The most common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   Combining one nitrate and one nitrite gives (NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻) = N₂O₅²⁻. This perfectly matches the remaining atoms (2 N, 5 O) and the required total charge (-2).\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nNow, we find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each:\n*   Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThis is a stoichiometric problem that can be solved by analyzing the products of the thermal decomposition.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases was formed and passed through three tubes.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 15.999 ≈ 18.015 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ **0.20 mol**.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, we can conclude that no acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO was formed and the weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   The simplest oxidizing gas containing oxygen is O₂. If the gas was O₂, this would correspond to 0.05 mol / 2 = **0.025 mol of O₂**.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas. The most common inert gas from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B decomposed entirely into H₂O, O₂, and N₂. We can verify the law of conservation of mass:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total Mass of Gases = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the salts, confirming our analysis of the products.\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = **0.40 mol H**\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = **0.20 mol N**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 O/O₂) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**\n\n### Step 3: Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe salts contain Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and Oxygen. Common salts with these elements are ammonium salts like ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The problem states the mixture of salts A and B is equimolar (contains the same number of moles of each salt).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) → N₂ + 2H₂O**\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) → N₂ + ½O₂ + 2H₂O** (This decomposition pathway for NH₄NO₃ occurs at 250-300°C and fits the products observed).\n\nLet the mixture contain `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   Total moles of N₂ produced = `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = 2`n`\n*   Total moles of H₂O produced = 2`n` (from A) + 2`n` (from B) = 4`n`\n*   Total moles of O₂ produced = 0 (from A) + 0.5`n` (from B) = 0.5`n`\n\nFrom our product analysis, we know:\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.025 mol. So, 0.5`n` = 0.025 mol ⇒ `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   Let's check this with the other products:\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 2`n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches our findings).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 4`n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe identification is consistent. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) atom from NH₄⁺ + 1 Nitrogen (N) atom from NO₂⁻ = 2 N atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) atom from NH₄⁺ + 1 Nitrogen (N) atom from NO₃⁻ = 2 N atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of atoms in both salts is the sum of the atoms in each formula:\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes the analysis of the gaseous products formed when the salt mixture is heated. Let's determine the identity and amount of each gas.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂).\n    *   Weight change = 0 g.\n    *   This means no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas that reacted are: Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol O / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   *Alternative consideration:* Another gas that could react is N₂O (dinitrogen monoxide), via Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. In this case, 0.05 mol of N₂O would have reacted to provide 0.05 mol of O atoms. We will keep this in mind.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** The gas that passed through all tubes without reacting.\n    *   Volume of C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C is non-acidic, not water, and doesn't react with hot copper (or is the product of a reaction with copper). The most likely candidate, given that we are dealing with salts, is nitrogen gas (N₂), which is very inert.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nThe elements in the original salts must be the same as the elements in the gaseous products. Let's find the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** All O comes from H₂O and the O₂ that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol H₂O × (1 mol O / 1 mol H₂O) + 0.05 mol O (from tube 3) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** Assuming gas C is N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N.\n\nNow, let's verify these amounts by calculating the total mass and comparing it to the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass = 0.40 g + 4.00 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial weight of the mixture perfectly. Our assumptions about the products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the mixture is equimolar (moles of A = moles of B = n) and contains only H, N, and O atoms. The total mole ratio of elements in the mixture is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To get integers, multiply by 20: 8 : 4 : 5.\n\nThe combined formula of (A + B) is therefore proportional to H₈N₄O₅. We need to find two common nitrogen-containing salts (A and B) that add up to this formula. Let's consider ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids:\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: H₄N₂O₃)\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: H₄N₂O₂)\n\nLet's check if these two salts work:\n*   (Formula of A) + (Formula of B) = (H₄N₂O₃) + (H₄N₂O₂) = H₈N₄O₅.\nThis matches our derived elemental ratio. So, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\nWe can further verify this by checking the reaction stoichiometry. If n moles of each salt decompose:\n*   `n` NH₄NO₂(s) → `n` N₂(g) + `2n` H₂O(g)\n*   `n` NH₄NO₃(s) → `n` N₂(g) + `n/2` O₂(g) + `2n` H₂O(g) (This is one possible decomposition at higher temperatures)\nTotal products:\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n/2\nComparing with our experimental results:\n*   H₂O: 4n = 0.20 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   N₂: 2n = 0.10 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   O₂: n/2 = 0.025 mol → n = 0.05 mol\nAll calculations yield n = 0.05 mol, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Salt A (e.g., Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Number of N atoms = 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Number of H atoms = 4\n    *   Number of O atoms = 3\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (e.g., Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Number of N atoms = 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Number of H atoms = 4\n    *   Number of O atoms = 2\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in A and B:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Experimental Data\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent used to absorb water. The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced by the decomposition.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The weight did not change, which means no CO₂ was produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** The weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This weight gain is from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, which did not react in any of the tubes, has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. This gas is inert under the given conditions, strongly suggesting it is Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Identify the Gaseous Products\n\nThe initial salts completely decompose into a mixture of gases. Based on the analysis above, the products are:\n1.  **Water (H₂O):** 0.2 mol\n2.  **An oxidizing gas** that supplied 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n3.  **An inert gas (N₂):** which is the final product, Gas C.\n\nLet's deduce the identity of the oxidizing gas. Two common nitrogen-based gases from salt decomposition fit this description:\n*   **Case A: The gas is Nitrous Oxide (N₂O).** The reaction with copper would be: `N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO`.\n    *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.05 mol of N₂O is required.\n    *   This reaction would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   The final 0.1 mol of inert gas (N₂) would be composed of this newly formed 0.05 mol N₂ and another 0.05 mol of N₂ that was also an initial product of the decomposition.\n    *   So, the gaseous products from the initial decomposition would be: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n\n*   **Case B: The gas is Oxygen (O₂).** The reaction with copper is: `O₂ + 2Cu → 2CuO`.\n    *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we need 0.025 mol of O₂ gas.\n    *   The remaining 0.1 mol of inert gas would be N₂.\n    *   In this scenario, the products are: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂.\n\n### 3. Identify the Original Salts (A and B)\n\nThe decomposition products contain nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. This points towards ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxoanions, like ammonium nitrate or ammonium nitrite. Let's test the decomposition reactions of these salts.\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n\nNow, let's see if an equimolar mixture of these two salts matches the products we deduced in **Case A**. Let's assume we started with 'x' moles of Salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 'x' moles of Salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   `x NH₄NO₂(s) → x N₂(g) + 2x H₂O(g)`\n*   `x NH₄NO₃(s) → x N₂O(g) + 2x H₂O(g)`\n\n**Total Products:**\n*   **N₂:** x mol\n*   **N₂O:** x mol\n*   **H₂O:** 2x + 2x = 4x mol\n\nLet's compare this to our derived products from the experiment (Case A): 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.2 mol H₂O.\n\n*   If x = 0.05 mol, the predicted products are:\n    *   N₂: 0.05 mol\n    *   N₂O: 0.05 mol\n    *   H₂O: 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol\nThese values perfectly match the experimental results.\n\n### 4. Verify the Initial Mass\n\nLet's check if the total mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ equals the given starting mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) = 64.06 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 80.06 g/mol\n\n*   Mass of Salt A = 0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol = 3.203 g\n*   Mass of Salt B = 0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol = 4.003 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.203 g + 4.003 g = 7.206 g\n\nThis calculated mass is in excellent agreement with the initial 7.20 g. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** I will first determine the composition and molar quantities of the gaseous products based on the experimental data provided.\n    *   The mass increase in tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂) corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced. I'll calculate the moles of H₂O.\n    *   The weight of tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂) did not change, which means no acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ were formed.\n    *   The mass increase in tube №3 (hot copper) corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms from an oxidizing gas (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ -> 2CuO. I'll calculate the moles of O₂.\n    *   The remaining gas C (2.24 L at STP) passed through all tubes, indicating it's unreactive. Given the likely elements, this gas must be nitrogen (N₂). I'll calculate its moles.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Reactants (Salts A and B):**\n    *   The products (H₂O, N₂, O₂) are composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. This strongly suggests that salts A and B are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions.\n    *   I'll consider the decomposition reactions of common salts that fit this profile. Specifically, ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂), which decompose as follows:\n        *   `2 NH₄NO₃(s) → 2 N₂(g) + 4 H₂O(g) + O₂(g)`\n        *   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2 H₂O(g)`\n    *   This pair of reactions produces all the observed gases and no others.\n\n3.  **Solve for Quantities:**\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n    *   Oxygen (O₂) is only produced by the decomposition of ammonium nitrate. Using the moles of O₂ calculated in step 1, I can determine the moles of ammonium nitrate (`n`) in the initial mixture.\n    *   Since the mixture is equimolar, the moles of ammonium nitrite will also be `n`.\n\n4.  **Verify the Hypothesis:**\n    *   Using the calculated value of `n`, I will verify that the decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produces the exact amounts of N₂ and H₂O calculated in step 1.\n    *   I will also calculate the total initial mass of the mixture (`n` * M(NH₄NO₃) + `n` * M(NH₄NO₂)) and check if it equals the given 7.20 g.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Once salts A and B are confirmed to be NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂, I will count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n    *   The final answer will be the sum of the atoms in NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses of relevant atoms and molecules (in g/mol)\nM_H = 1.0\nM_N = 14.0\nM_O = 16.0\nM_H2O = 2 * M_H + M_O\nM_N2 = 2 * M_N\nM_O2 = 2 * M_O\n\n# --- Step 1: Analyze the gaseous products ---\nprint(\"Step 1: Determining the moles of each gaseous product.\")\n\n# Water (H2O) absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nprint(f\"The mass of water produced is {mass_H2O} g, which is {moles_H2O:.3f} moles of H2O.\")\n\n# Oxygen (O2) reacted with hot copper.

The gaseous products are analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds directly to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ (which would form a CaCO₃ precipitate) or SO₂. The fact that its weight did not change means that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition. This rules out salts like carbonates, sulfites, or most sulfates.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This weight increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The oxidizing gas must have supplied these 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms. Common oxidizing gases in such decompositions are O₂ or N₂O.\n        *   If the gas was O₂, we would have 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol of O₂.\n        *   If the gas was N₂O, we would have 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas C remains. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C did not react with a drying agent, limewater, or hot copper, indicating it's an inert gas like N₂.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the composition of the gaseous products.**\nLet's consider the two possibilities for the oxidizing gas.\n\n*   **Possibility A:** The oxidizing gas is N₂O. The reaction in tube №3 is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.05 mol of N₂O must have reacted.\n    *   This reaction would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   The total remaining gas C (0.10 mol) would be the sum of any inert gas produced directly from the salt decomposition and the 0.05 mol of N₂ produced in tube №3. This means the initial salt decomposition must have produced 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of an inert gas (likely N₂).\n    *   So, the initial gaseous products were: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** The oxidizing gas is O₂. The reaction in tube №3 is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.025 mol of O₂ must have reacted.\n    *   The remaining gas C (0.10 mol) would be the inert gas from the initial decomposition.\n    *   So, the initial gaseous products were: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\nPossibility A is more likely given the common decomposition products of nitrogen-containing salts. Let's proceed with this assumption and verify it.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the salts A and B.**\nThe products (H₂O, N₂O, N₂) strongly suggest that the original salts contain Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Common salts that fit this profile are ammonium salts of oxyanions of nitrogen.\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Decomposes upon heating: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes upon heating: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nLet's test if an equimolar mixture of these two salts (A and B) matches our findings. Let the mixture contain `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   From `n` mol of NH₄NO₂: `n` mol of N₂ and `2n` mol of H₂O are produced.\n*   From `n` mol of NH₄NO₃: `n` mol of N₂O and `2n` mol of H₂O are produced.\n\n**Total products from the mixture:**\n*   Total N₂ = `n` mol\n*   Total N₂O = `n` mol\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = `4n` mol\n\nNow, let's match this with our derived amounts from Step 2 (Possibility A):\n*   Total H₂O: `4n` = 0.20 mol  =>  `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   Total N₂O: `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   Total N₂: `n` = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three calculations yield a consistent value of `n = 0.05` mol. This confirms our hypothesis. The initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the total mass.**\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 2*14 + 4*1 + 2*16 = 28 + 4 + 32 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 2*14 + 4*1 + 3*16 = 28 + 4 + 48 = 80 g/mol.\n\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total mass of mixture = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem. The identification of salts A and B as ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate is correct.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe final question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in salts A and B** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful desiccant and absorbs water. The mass increase is due to the absorption of H₂O.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Moles of H₂O = `mass / molar mass` = `3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol` ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is lime water, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂. The mass did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the copper reacted with an oxidizing gas by taking its oxygen. The mass increase of the tube is equal to the mass of oxygen captured.\n    *   Mass of oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = `mass / molar mass` = `0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol` = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The production of H₂O and nitrogen-containing compounds suggests the original salts are nitrogen-based. A likely oxidizing gas is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O), which decomposes on hot copper: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂. This reaction delivers exactly one oxygen atom per molecule of N₂O. Therefore, the amount of N₂O gas must be 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C (remaining gas):** 2.24 L of a gas remains at STP. This gas did not react with any of the previous reagents.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = `volume / molar volume at STP` = `2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol` = 0.10 mol.\n    *   An inert gas under these conditions is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe gaseous products are H₂O (0.20 mol), N₂O (0.05 mol), and a final amount of N₂ (0.10 mol). The lack of C, S, etc., and the presence of N, H, and O strongly suggest that salts A and B are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. Let's hypothesize their identities based on common thermal decomposition reactions:\n*   Ammonium nitrite decomposition: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   Ammonium nitrate decomposition: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n\nLet's assume the equimolar mixture consists of `x` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `x` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**3. Stoichiometric Verification**\n\n*   **Total H₂O:** `x` mol NH₄NO₂ produces `2x` mol H₂O. `x` mol NH₄NO₃ produces `2x` mol H₂O. Total H₂O = `2x + 2x = 4x`.\n    *   We found `n(H₂O) = 0.20 mol`, so `4x = 0.20 mol` → `x = 0.05 mol`.\n\n*   **N₂O:** `x` mol of NH₄NO₃ produces `x` mol of N₂O.\n    *   If `x = 0.05 mol`, this gives 0.05 mol of N₂O. This matches our deduction from the mass gain of the copper tube.\n\n*   **Final N₂ (Gas C):** `x` mol of NH₄NO₂ produces `x` mol of N₂. The reaction of N₂O with copper (`N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂`) produces another `x` mol of N₂. Total N₂ = `x + x = 2x`.\n    *   If `x = 0.05 mol`, total N₂ = `2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol`. This matches the moles of Gas C.\n\n*   **Initial Mass:** The hypothesis holds for all products. Let's check the initial mass.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n    *   Total Mass = `mass(NH₄NO₃) + mass(NH₄NO₂)`\n    *   Total Mass = `(x * 80.04) + (x * 64.04)` = `0.05 * (80.04 + 64.04)` = `0.05 * 144.08` = 7.204 g. This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms in salts A and B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the composition of salts A and B and the total number of atoms.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Gaseous Products\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from heating the salts was passed through three tubes sequentially. We can identify the components of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water absorbed.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change indicates that no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) or readily soluble basic gases (like NH₃) were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    The oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas. Given the likely elements (N, H, O from salts), nitrous oxide (N₂O) is a strong candidate. The reaction is:\n    Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    According to this reaction, 0.05 moles of N₂O would react to provide the 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms, and this reaction would also produce 0.05 moles of nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    This remaining gas must be inert to all three tubes. Nitrogen (N₂) fits this description. This 0.1 mol of N₂ is the total amount collected at the end. It consists of any N₂ that was in the initial gas mixture plus the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction in tube №3.\n    *   Total N₂ = Initial N₂ + N₂ (from N₂O)\n    *   0.1 mol = Initial N₂ + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, Initial N₂ = 0.05 mol.\n\nBased on this analysis, the initial mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was:\n*   0.2 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n### 2. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe gaseous products are water, nitrous oxide, and nitrogen gas. This product mix strongly suggests the thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture of salts A and B was equimolar. Let's assume 'x' moles of each salt were present.\n*   Decomposition of 'x' moles of NH₄NO₃ produces 'x' moles of N₂O and '2x' moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of 'x' moles of NH₄NO₂ produces 'x' moles of N₂ and '2x' moles of H₂O.\n\nComparing this with our calculated moles of products:\n*   Moles of N₂O = x = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂ = x = 0.05 mol\nBoth equations yield x = 0.05 mol, which is consistent with the equimolar condition.\n\nNow, let's check the moles of water:\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2x (from NH₄NO₃) + 2x (from NH₄NO₂) = 4x\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 4 * (0.05 mol) = 0.2 mol.\nThis matches the amount of water calculated from the experiment in Tube №1.\n\n### 3. Verification of Total Mass\n\nLet's verify that the mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ equals the given total mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 2(14.01) + 4(1.01) + 3(16.00) = 80.06 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 2(14.01) + 4(1.01) + 2(16.00) = 64.06 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 4.003 g + 3.203 g = 7.206 g.\n\nThis value is in excellent agreement with the 7.20 g stated in the problem. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Total Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 nitrogen atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms.\n    Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 nitrogen atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms.\n    Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was passed through a series of tubes, allowing for the identification and quantification of the components:\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol = 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight of this tube did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted to form copper oxide (CuO).\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After the sequential removal of water and oxygen, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n    *   This remaining gas is non-reactive with the agents in the tubes, which strongly suggests it is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nTo confirm the identities of the products, we can check the mass balance. The total mass of the initial salt mixture was 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = 0.1 mol * 28.014 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of gaseous products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g\n\nThe total mass of the products equals the initial mass of the reactants, confirming that decomposition was complete and our product identification (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) is correct.\n\n**2. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe gaseous products contain nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. The original salts must therefore be composed of these elements. Since the problem describes salts that decompose completely into gases upon heating, ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyacids are strong candidates.\n\nLet's examine the molar ratios of the products:\n*   N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.1 mol : 0.025 mol : 0.2 mol\n*   Simplifying this ratio by dividing by the smallest value (0.025) gives: **4 : 1 : 8**\n\nNow, consider the thermal decomposition of likely salts:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes to produce nitrogen and water:\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** At higher temperatures (above 250-300°C), its decomposition primarily produces nitrogen, oxygen, and water:\n    2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture of salts A and B was equimolar. Let's assume we have 'n' moles of Salt A and 'n' moles of Salt B. If we hypothesize that the salts are ammonium nitrate (A) and ammonium nitrite (B):\n*   **From n moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio):**\n    *   n moles of N₂\n    *   0.5n moles of O₂\n    *   2n moles of H₂O\n*   **From n moles of NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   n moles of N₂\n    *   2n moles of H₂O\n\nCombining the products from the equimolar mixture:\n*   **Total N₂** = n + n = 2n\n*   **Total O₂** = 0.5n\n*   **Total H₂O** = 2n + 2n = 4n\n\nThe predicted molar ratio of the products from this mixture is **N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 2n : 0.5n : 4n**, which simplifies to **4 : 1 : 8**. This perfectly matches the experimentally determined ratio.\n\nWe can now find the value of 'n' using the known moles of any product:\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n\nThis confirms the initial mixture contained 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrate and 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrite.\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two identified salts.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\nThe total number of atoms in both salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Products of the Decomposition\n\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated, forming only a mixture of gases. This gas mixture was passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Copper reacts with oxygen to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   This means 0.80 g of oxygen atoms (O) were in the gas mixture.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as a diatomic molecule (O₂) in the gas, the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After the other components were removed, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n### 2. Identify Gas C\n\nWe can determine the molar mass of Gas C using the law of conservation of mass. The initial mass of the salts (7.20 g) must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol is most likely nitrogen gas (N₂), which has a molar mass of 28.02 g/mol. Nitrogen is also inert under the conditions in the tubes, which is consistent with the observations.\n\n### 3. Determine the Empirical Formula of the Salts\n\nThe original salts A and B decomposed into 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂. From this, we can find the total amount of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = (0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To convert this to a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**.\n\n### 4. Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe salts are in an equimolar mixture. This means for every mole of salt A, there is one mole of salt B. The combined empirical formula of one unit of A plus one unit of B is N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   The presence of 8 hydrogen atoms suggests the presence of two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), as 2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n*   If we assign two NH₄⁺ ions, the remaining atoms for the two anions are N₄₋₂O₅, or N₂O₅.\n*   We need to split the N₂O₅ composition into two separate, common anions. The most logical split is into a nitrate ion (NO₃⁻) and a nitrite ion (NO₂⁻).\n\nThis leads to the identification of the two salts:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions. At elevated temperatures, ammonium nitrite decomposes to nitrogen and water:\nNH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nThe decomposition of ammonium nitrate typically yields N₂O and H₂O. However, at higher temperatures or in the presence of other substances, it can decompose completely to nitrogen, oxygen, and water, which matches the observed products.\n2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O, or per mole: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nThis combination of salts and their decomposition pathways perfectly matches all the quantitative data from the experiment.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 (in A) + 9 (in B) = 17 atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the reaction and products**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The gaseous products are passed through a series of tubes to identify and quantify them.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   To find the moles of water: Moles = Mass / Molar Mass.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2*(1.008) + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, which means no CO₂ or other acidic gases were present in the product mixture. This tells us the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO was formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This increase is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from molecular oxygen (O₂) or another oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n        *   If it was O₂, the reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol, which contains 0.05 mol of O atoms.\n        *   If it was N₂O, the reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol, which contains 0.05 mol of O atoms.\n    *   In either case, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms were transferred to the copper.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C**\n    *   The remaining gas does not react with any of the previous reagents. Its volume is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the products (H₂O, O-containing gas), the salts likely contain N, H, and O. A common inert gas from the decomposition of such salts is nitrogen gas (N₂). So, we can confidently assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial mixture**\n\nFrom the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N ends up as the final gas N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and the species that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles of O in H₂O) + (Moles of O captured by Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's check if the total mass of these elements matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly. Thus, salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. This points towards ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen oxyanions (like NO₂⁻ or NO₃⁻). Let's consider the decomposition of these salts.\n\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃(s). Its decomposition depends on temperature. At around 200°C, the main reaction is NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g). N₂O is an oxidizing gas that would react with hot copper.\n\nLet's hypothesize that A = **NH₄NO₂** and B = **NH₄NO₃**. The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B.\n\nLet's trace the products from this hypothetical mixture:\n*   n moles of NH₄NO₂ decomposes to: n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   n moles of NH₄NO₃ decomposes to: n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nThe total initial products would be:\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n moles.\n*   Gases to be passed over hot copper: n moles of N₂ (from A) and n moles of N₂O (from B).\n\nNow, let's match this to our experimental data:\n*   From H₂O: Moles of H₂O = 4n = 0.20 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**.\n*   From Tube 3: n moles of N₂O react with Cu. This involves the transfer of n moles of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Moles of O captured by Cu = n = 0.05 mol. This is a perfect match.\n*   From Gas C: The N₂ gas from A (n moles) passes through unreacted. The N₂O from B reacts to form N₂ (n moles).\n    *   Total final N₂ = n (from A) + n (from B's product) = n + n = 2n.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.05 mol = 0.10 mol. This also matches perfectly.\n\nAll data are consistent with the mixture being 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two identified salts.\n\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   Atoms: 2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 2 Oxygen (O)\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n    *   Atoms: 2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 3 Oxygen (O)\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in salts A and B:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 17\nB) 13\nC) 19\nD) 15\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\n    The experiment is designed to identify the gases produced when the mixture of salts A and B is heated.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 1.008*2 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The mass of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted. So, 0.80 g of O₂ was produced.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ ≈ 16.00*2 = 32.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After removing H₂O and O₂, 2.24 L of a gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). The gas did not react with a desiccant, a base, or hot copper. This suggests a non-reactive gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n    *   **Summary of Products:** The decomposition of salts A and B produced 0.20 mol of H₂O, 0.025 mol of O₂, and 0.10 mol of N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\n    Since the products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂, the original salts must contain the elements Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). Let's calculate the total amount of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Total moles of H atoms:** From 0.20 mol H₂O, there are 0.20 * 2 = 0.40 mol of H.\n    *   **Total moles of N atoms:** From 0.10 mol N₂, there are 0.10 * 2 = 0.20 mol of N.\n    *   **Total moles of O atoms:** Oxygen comes from both H₂O and O₂.\n        *   From H₂O: 0.20 mol of O.\n        *   From O₂: 0.025 * 2 = 0.05 mol of O.\n        *   Total moles of O = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol of O.\n\n    *   **Verify Mass:** Let's check if the masses of these elements sum to the initial mass.\n        *   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.008 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.007 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.00 g/mol)\n        *   Mass ≈ 0.403 g + 2.801 g + 4.000 g ≈ 7.204 g. This confirms the composition.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n\n    We have an equimolar mixture of two salts containing N, H, and O. The overall mole ratio of atoms in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simpler integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n\n    Let's consider common salts containing these elements. Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) are excellent candidates as they are known to decompose upon heating to produce the observed gases.\n    *   Formula of Salt A: NH₄NO₃ (empirical formula N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   Formula of Salt B: NH₄NO₂ (empirical formula N₂H₄O₂)\n\n    If we combine one formula unit of each, the total atomic composition is:\n    *   N: 2 + 2 = 4\n    *   H: 4 + 4 = 8\n    *   O: 3 + 2 = 5\n    This gives the ratio N₄H₈O₅, which exactly matches our experimental finding. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n4.  **Confirm with Stoichiometry**\n\n    Let's verify that the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these salts produces the correct amount of products. Let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt in the mixture.\n    *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   From n moles of NH₄NO₂, we get n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n    *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrate: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n        *   From n moles of NH₄NO₃, we get n moles of N₂, n/2 moles of O₂, and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\n    *   Total moles of products:\n        *   N₂: n + n = 2n\n        *   O₂: n/2\n        *   H₂O: 2n + 2n = 4n\n\n    *   From our results, we know total moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol. So, 2n = 0.10 mol, which means n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Let's check this value with the other products:\n        *   Expected O₂ = n/2 = 0.05/2 = 0.025 mol. (Matches)\n        *   Expected H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (Matches)\n\n    *   Finally, let's check the total mass:\n        *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.002 g\n        *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g\n        *   Total mass = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g. (Matches)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes a sequence of reactions to identify the gaseous products from the decomposition. Let's analyze each step:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This is a key finding: the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, and the mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is entirely due to the oxygen atoms that have bonded with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This indicates that one of the gaseous products contained 0.05 moles of reactive oxygen atoms. A common decomposition product of nitrogen-based salts is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O). The reaction with hot copper would be: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. In this reaction, 0.05 moles of N₂O would provide the 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms to form CuO, and it would also produce 0.05 moles of N₂ gas.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas (C) is chemically inert to the reagents used, which strongly identifies it as nitrogen gas (N₂). This final 0.10 mol of N₂ consists of any N₂ produced directly in the decomposition plus the N₂ produced in Tube №3.\n    *   Total N₂ collected = N₂(from initial decomposition) + N₂(from N₂O reaction in Tube 3)\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂(initial) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, the initial decomposition must have directly produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n**2. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nFrom our analysis, the initial decomposition produced a gas mixture of:\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n\nWe are looking for two nitrogen-hydrogen-oxygen salts (A and B) that would yield these products. The decomposition reactions of ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate are a perfect match:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. If we assume the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃, the products would be:\n*   From NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From NH₄NO₃: 0.05 mol N₂O and 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   Total products: 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol H₂O.\n\nThis perfectly matches our findings from the experimental data. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This implies the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning identified the salts as Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3).\n# The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt combined.\n\n# Formula for Ammonium Nitrite is NH4NO2.\n# We can represent its elemental count as N2H4O2.\natoms_in_salt_A = 2 + 4 + 2 # (2 N, 4 H, 2 O)\n\n# Formula for Ammonium Nitrate is NH4NO3.\n# We can represent its elemental count as N2H4O3.\natoms_in_salt_B = 2 + 4 + 3 # (2 N, 4 H, 3 O)\n\n# The total number of atoms is the sum of atoms in one unit of A and one unit of B.\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_salt_A + atoms_in_salt_B\nprint(total_atoms)\n\n```\n\n17\n\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 17\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThe reasoning and calculations have been successfully validated by the code execution.\n\n1.  **Identify Products from Experimental Data:**\n    *   Tube 1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂): Absorbs H₂O. Mass gain = 3.60 g. Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂): No weight change implies no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) were formed.\n    *   Tube 3 (Hot Copper): Hot Cu reacts with an oxidizing gas, and CuO is formed. The weight gain of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen. Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol. The gas supplying the oxygen is likely a nitrogen oxide, as water has already been removed.\n    *   Remaining Gas (C): Volume = 2.24 L at STP. Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. This gas is inert to all previous reagents, suggesting it is N₂.\n\n2.  **Hypothesize Salts A and B:**\n    *   The products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxide of nitrogen) and the complete decomposition into gases strongly suggest ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n        *   A: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   B: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   The N₂O gas from salt B would then react with the hot copper in tube №3:\n        *   N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This reaction supplies the oxygen atoms detected.\n\n3.  **Verify the Hypothesis:**\n    *   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the moles of each salt.\n    *   From the decomposition reactions:\n        *   Total moles of H₂O = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = 4n.\n        *   From our data, moles of H₂O = 0.2 mol. So, 4n = 0.2 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Now, let's check the other products with n = 0.05 mol.\n        *   **Tube 3:** Salt B produces 'n' moles of N₂O. Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol. This provides 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. Mass of O = 0.05 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 0.80 g. This matches the experimental data.\n        *   **Gas C (N₂):** The final N₂ gas comes from two sources: the decomposition of salt A ('n' moles) and the reduction of N₂O ('n' moles). Total N₂ = n + n = 2n = 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This matches the experimental data for gas C.\n        *   **Initial Mass:** Let's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of each salt is 7.20 g.\n            *   Mass of NH₄NO₂ (Molar Mass ≈ 64 g/mol) = 0.05 mol × 64 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n            *   Mass of NH₄NO₃ (Molar Mass ≈ 80 g/mol) = 0.05 mol × 80 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n            *   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass.\n    *   The hypothesis is correct. Salts A and B are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂: 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃: 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe user wants me to solve a quantitative chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Information Distillation**\n*   **Reactants:** 7.20 g of an equimolar mixture of Salt A and Salt B.\n*   **Reaction:** Heated to 200°C, decomposing completely into gases.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The gas mixture passed through Tube 1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂), whose weight increased by 3.60 g. This substance absorbs water.\n    *   Then through Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution), whose weight did not change. This indicates no acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ were absorbed.\n    *   Then through Tube 3 (red-hot copper), whose weight increased by 0.80 g due to CuO formation. This indicates the presence of oxygen.\n    *   The remaining gas, C, has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n*   **Goal:** Find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B combined.\n\n**2. Step-by-step Derivations**\n\n*   **Step 2a: Identify and quantify the products.**\n    *   **Tube 1:** The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of H₂O.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube 3:** The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen that reacted with Cu to form CuO.\n        *   The gas must be O₂. The mass increase is purely the mass of oxygen atoms.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since the gas is O₂, moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L at STP.\n        *   Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   **Tube 2:** The weight did not change. The gases entering it were the products from decomposition minus the water absorbed in Tube 1. The gas C that remains is inert to the whole system, and O₂ does not react with Ca(OH)₂. Therefore, gas C must be something inert like N₂, which is a common decomposition product. Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Verify product identification with the law of conservation of mass.**\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of N₂ produced = 0.1 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n    *   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the salt mixture perfectly. Our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) is correct.\n\n*   **Step 2c: Determine the total elemental composition of the initial mixture.**\n    *   Moles of Hydrogen (H) = 0.2 mol H₂O * 2 H/H₂O = 0.4 mol H.\n    *   Moles of Nitrogen (N) = 0.1 mol N₂ * 2 N/N₂ = 0.2 mol N.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen (O) = (0.2 mol H₂O * 1 O/H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ * 2 O/O₂) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n    *   The total moles of elements in the 7.20 g mixture are H: 0.4, N: 0.2, O: 0.25.\n    *   The ratio of atoms is H:N:O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25. To get integers, multiply by 20: H:N:O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n\n*   **Step 2d: Identify Salts A and B.**\n    *   The total empirical formula of the mixture is H₈N₄O₅.\n    *   Since the mixture is equimolar, this formula represents the sum of the atoms in one molecule of salt A and one molecule of salt B: Formula(A) + Formula(B) = H₈N₄O₅.\n    *   The elements are H, N, and O, suggesting ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n    *   H₈N₄O₅ contains eight hydrogen atoms, which corresponds perfectly to two ammonium cations (2 x NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈).\n    *   The remaining part is N₂O₅. This can be split into two common anions: NO₃⁻ and NO₂⁻.\n    *   Let Salt A be ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Let Salt B be ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Let's check the sum: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This matches our derived formula.\n\n*   **Step 2e: Verify the decomposition reactions.**\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₂: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₃: At temperatures around 200°C, one possible decomposition pathway is 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). The problem conditions (presence of O₂ as a product) support this pathway over the more common decomposition to N₂O.\n    *   Let's assume there are `x` moles of each salt.\n        *   `x` mol NH₄NO₂ produces `x` mol N₂ and `2x` mol H₂O.\n        *   `x` mol NH₄NO₃ produces `x` mol N₂ + `0.5x` mol O₂ + `2x` mol H₂O (based on the stoichiometry above).\n    *   Total products: `2x` mol N₂, `4x` mol H₂O, and `0.5x` mol O₂.\n    *   We found n(N₂) = 0.1 mol, n(H₂O) = 0.2 mol, and n(O₂) = 0.025 mol.\n    *   Let's check the ratios:\n        *   n(H₂O) / n(O₂) = 0.2 / 0.025 = 8. Theoretical ratio = `4x` / `0.5x` = 8. (Matches)\n        *   n(N₂) / n(O₂) = 0.1 / 0.025 = 4. Theoretical ratio = `2x` / `0.5x` = 4. (Matches)\n    *   The proposed identities of the salts and their decomposition reactions are consistent with all the data.\n\n*   **Step 2f: Calculate the final answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nFinal check of all steps. The logic is consistent and all provided data points have been used and accounted for. The identification of products from the experimental setup is standard chemical knowledge. The deduction of the reactants from the products is a logical stoichiometric calculation. The final step is a simple counting of atoms based on the derived formulas.\n\nBased on the detailed step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, the correct answer is 17. This corresponds to option B.The detailed stoichiometric analysis has led to the identification of salts A and B as ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂), respectively.\n\nThe number of atoms in each salt is calculated as follows:\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms, for a total of 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms, for a total of 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit.\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis detailed calculation, which is consistent with all the experimental data provided in the problem statement, confirms the result.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was passed through three tubes, and the mass changes were recorded. This allows us to identify the components of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds directly to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ **0.2 mol H₂O**\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of this tube did not change, no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of the tube is due to the oxygen atoms bonding with the copper to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). Therefore, the mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol O\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of oxygen gas are:\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol O / 2 = **0.025 mol O₂**\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that remained after passing through all three tubes had a volume of 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.1 mol Gas C**\n    *   This remaining gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. The most likely candidate for a gas produced from nitrogen-containing salts is the inert nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n### **2. Verification with Mass Conservation**\n\nLet's check if the mass of the products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol × 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = 0.1 mol × 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Products** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture. This confirms our identification of the products and their quantities: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂.\n\n### **3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe gaseous products contain Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. This means the original salts must be composed of these elements. Since they are salts, they consist of a cation and an anion. Common ions formed from these elements are the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺) and the nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻) anions. This strongly suggests that the salts are ammonium-based.\n\nLet's consider the decomposition of **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n*   **Reaction 1:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Reaction 2:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. Let 'n' be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B.\n*   Moles of A = n\n*   Moles of B = n\n\nBased on the stoichiometry of the reactions above, we can express the moles of each product in terms of 'n':\n*   **Total N₂ produced:** n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = 2n\n*   **Total H₂O produced:** 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n\n*   **Total O₂ produced:** 0 (from NH₄NO₂) + n/2 (from NH₄NO₃) = n/2\n\nNow, we equate these with the moles calculated from the experimental results:\n*   Total N₂: 2n = 0.1 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Total H₂O: 4n = 0.2 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Total O₂: n/2 = 0.025 mol => **n = 0.05 mol**\n\nThe value of **n = 0.05 mol** is consistent for all three products, which strongly confirms that the salts are indeed Ammonium Nitrite and Ammonium Nitrate.\n\n### **4. Final Calculation: Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 8**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 9**\n\n*   **Total atoms in salts A and B combined:** 8 + 9 = **17**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Observations**\n\nThe problem describes the heating of an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃) and change the mass of the tube. Since the weight did not change, no significant amount of acidic gas like CO₂ was produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   Hot copper can also react with nitrogen oxides. For example, nitrous oxide (N₂O) reacts to form nitrogen gas and copper oxide (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO). This possibility must be considered.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas did not react with the drying agent, limewater, or hot copper. The most common inert gas in such decompositions is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify the Products of Decomposition**\n\nBased on the analysis, the gaseous products from heating salts A and B are:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\n**3. Determine the Composition and Moles of the Initial Salts**\n\nThe products contain nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, which must have come from the initial salts. This points towards ammonium salts of oxyacids of nitrogen. Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe decomposition reactions for these salts are:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate:** The decomposition is temperature-dependent. At around 200°C, the main reaction produces nitrous oxide: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g). However, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, a different reaction can occur: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\nLet's assume the mixture is equimolar, with `n` moles of each salt. Let's calculate `n` from the total mass.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol\n*   Total mass = `n * (64.04) + n * (80.04) = 7.20` g\n*   `n * (144.08) = 7.20`\n*   `n = 7.20 / 144.08 ≈ 0.05` mol\n\nSo, we have **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂** and **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃**. Now let's see if their decomposition products match the experimental results.\n\n*   **Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   Using NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Products: **0.05 mol N₂** and **0.10 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Let's test the reaction: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O.\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃, the moles of products are:\n        *   N₂: (0.05 mol NH₄NO₃) * (2 mol N₂ / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = **0.05 mol N₂**\n        *   O₂: (0.05 mol NH₄NO₃) * (1 mol O₂ / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = **0.025 mol O₂**\n        *   H₂O: (0.05 mol NH₄NO₃) * (4 mol H₂O / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = **0.10 mol H₂O**\n\n*   **Total products from the mixture:**\n    *   Total Moles H₂O = 0.10 (from nitrite) + 0.10 (from nitrate) = **0.20 mol**. (Matches experiment)\n    *   Total Moles O₂ = 0 (from nitrite) + 0.025 (from nitrate) = **0.025 mol**.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the candidate solutions.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Experimental Data**\n\nThe core of the problem is to identify two salts, A and B, based on the products of their thermal decomposition.\n\n*   **Initial State:** 7.20 g of an equimolar mixture of Salt A and Salt B.\n*   **Tube №1 (Drying Agent):** The mass increased by 3.60 g. This directly corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Acidic Gas Trap):** The mass did not change. This is a crucial clue that **no acidic gases** (like CO₂ or SO₂) were formed. The salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n*   **Tube №3 (Hot Copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g. The problem states CuO was formed, so this mass gain is purely from oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Final Gas (C):** 2.24 L at STP. This corresponds to 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. This gas is inert to all previous traps, strongly suggesting it is Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Chemical Formulas of the Salts**\n\nTwo main lines of reasoning emerge from the candidate answers, both leading to the same conclusion.\n\n*   **Path A: Assuming the oxidizing gas was O₂.**\n    *   If the 0.80 g of oxygen atoms came from O₂ gas, then moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   The total decomposition products are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n    *   The total mass of these products is (0.2 * 18) + (0.025 * 32) + (0.1 * 28) = 3.60 + 0.80 + 2.80 = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass.\n    *   The elemental composition of the salts is:\n        *   N: 0.10 mol N₂ * 2 = 0.20 mol\n        *   H: 0.20 mol H₂O * 2 = 0.40 mol\n        *   O: (0.20 mol H₂O * 1) + (0.025 mol O₂ * 2) = 0.25 mol\n    *   The elemental ratio N:H:O is 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25, which simplifies to the integer ratio **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n*   **Path B: Assuming the oxidizing gas was N₂O (more likely at 200°C).**\n    *   The reaction in tube 3 is N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.05 mol of N₂O was needed. This reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   The final 0.10 mol of gas C (N₂) is comprised of the 0.05 mol from this reaction, plus 0.05 mol of N₂ from the initial decomposition.\n    *   The total decomposition products are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n    *   The total mass is (0.2 * 18) + (0.05 * 44) + (0.05 * 28) = 3.60 + 2.20 + 1.40 = 7.20 g. This also matches.\n    *   The elemental composition of the salts is:\n        *   N: (0.05 mol N₂O * 2) + (0.05 mol N₂ * 2) = 0.20 mol\n        *   H: 0.20 mol H₂O * 2 = 0.40 mol\n        *   O: (0.20 mol H₂O * 1) + (0.05 mol N₂O * 1) = 0.25 mol\n    *   The elemental ratio N:H:O is 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25, which again simplifies to **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nBoth valid chemical interpretations lead to the same combined formula for the two salts (A+B): **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B and Calculate the Atoms**\n\nSince the mixture is equimolar, we need to split the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas. The common salts containing N, H, and O that fit this are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n*   Salt A: **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**, formula N₂H₄O₃\n*   Salt B: **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **, formula N₂H₄O₂\n\nLet's check the sum of their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is simply the total number of atoms in the combined formula N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   Total Atoms = 4 (Nitrogen) + 8 (Hydrogen) + 5 (Oxygen) = **17 atoms**.\n\nAlternatively, we can count them from the individual formulas:\n*   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n*   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n*   Total = 9 + 8 = **17 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Let's analyze the effect of each tube:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   Mass change = 0. This indicates that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, which means the gas contained oxygen atoms that were transferred to the copper.\n    *   Mass increase = 0.80 g. This is the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas (O₂ + 2Cu → 2CuO) or another oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO). In either case, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms were delivered by the gas stream.\n\n*   **Final Gas C:** The remaining gas does not react with any of the reagents.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the reactants are salts likely containing nitrogen (as we will see), this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the initial salts. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O from H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O that formed CuO = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming Gas C is N₂.\n    *   The final gas is 0.10 mol of N₂. We must also account for any N₂ produced in Tube 3 if the reacting gas was N₂O.\n    *   Let's consider the two possibilities for the gas reacting in Tube 3:\n        1.  If it was O₂, then the initial gas mixture contained 0.10 mol N₂. Total N = 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol.\n        2.  If it was N₂O, then 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted (since it contains 0.05 mol of O). This reaction (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO) produces 0.05 mol of N₂. The final 0.10 mol of N₂ would be this 0.05 mol plus 0.05 mol of N₂ that was present initially. In this case, the total nitrogen is also 0.05 mol (from N₂O) + 0.05 mol (from initial N₂) = 0.10 mol of N₂ molecules, which is 0.20 mol of N atoms.\n    *   In both plausible scenarios, the total moles of Nitrogen atoms in the products is 0.20 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture contains:\n*   0.40 mol of H\n*   0.25 mol of O\n*   0.20 mol of N\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains n moles of salt A and n moles of salt B. The combined chemical formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B must have an elemental ratio of N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get integers, divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiply by 4 to get whole numbers:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nWe need to find two common salts (A and B) that are composed of N, H, and O, and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The fact that they decompose completely into gases at 200°C strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions.\nLet's try the most common ones: ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n*   **Salt A candidate:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Formula: N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Salt B candidate:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Formula: N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅.\nThis is a perfect match.\n\nWe can verify this by checking the total mass.\nMolar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\nMolar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\nThe total moles of elements (N=0.20, H=0.40, O=0.25) correspond to a total mass of 0.20*14 + 0.40*1 + 0.25*16 = 2.8 + 0.4 + 4.0 = 7.20 g, which matches the initial mass.\nThe number of moles of the (N₄H₈O₅) unit is 7.20 g / (80+64) g/mol = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\nSince the mixture is equimolar (n moles of A and n moles of B), the 0.05 mol of the combined unit corresponds to 0.05 mol of A and 0.05 mol of B. This is consistent with all the data derived in the first steps.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms in A and B:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17 atoms.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the products of the thermal decomposition\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from heating the salts was passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze what each tube tells us about the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)**\n    *   This solution is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂) or sulfur dioxide (SO₂).\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change, indicating that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas did not react with a strong dehydrating agent, limewater, or hot copper, it is likely nitrogen gas (N₂), a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n### 2. Verify the composition and identify the salts\n\nLet's summarize the decomposition products:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.025 mol of O₂\n*   0.10 mol of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂)\n\nLet's check the total mass of these products:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of gases = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass is exactly equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture, which confirms our identification of the products and their quantities. The original salts must therefore be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nThe production of N₂, H₂O, and O₂ upon heating is characteristic of the decomposition of certain ammonium salts. The most common salts that fit this profile are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's assume:\n*   Salt A is **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   Salt B is **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n1.  NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n2.  2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let 'x' be the number of moles of each salt.\n*   Moles of NH₄NO₂ = x\n*   Moles of NH₄NO₃ = x\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reactions, we can calculate the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total H₂O:** (2 * x) from NH₄NO₂ + (4/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   **Total O₂:** 0 from NH₄NO₂ + (1/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = 0.5x\n*   **Total N₂:** (1 * x) from NH₄NO₂ + (2/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = x + x = 2x\n\nNow, we can use the moles of products we calculated earlier to find 'x':\n*   From O₂: 0.5x = 0.025 mol  => x = 0.05 mol.\n*   From H₂O: 4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This matches our calculation).\n*   From N₂: 2x = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe value x = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products. Let's also verify the initial mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.05 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol) = 3.202 g + 4.0025 g = 7.2045 g.\nThis is consistent with the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total number of atoms\n\nThe salts have been correctly identified as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 2 Oxygen (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 3 Oxygen (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** We'll start by using the information from the experiment to determine the chemical nature and amount (in moles) of each gaseous product formed when the salt mixture was heated.\n    *   The weight increase in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ (a drying agent) corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   The fact that the weight of the Ca(OH)₂ solution did not change means no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n    *   The weight increase of the red-hot copper is due to its reaction with oxygen (O₂), forming CuO. This increase is the mass of the oxygen.\n    *   The remaining gas, C, which passed through all tubes unreacted, can be identified by calculating its molar mass from the given volume at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). We'll also verify the law of conservation of mass.\n\n2.  **Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture:** Based on the moles of H₂O, O₂, and gas C, we can calculate the total moles of hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N) atoms in the original mixture. This will give us the overall empirical formula for the combined salts (A+B).\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:** The problem states that A and B are salts that decompose into only gaseous products. The presence of H₂O and N₂ as products strongly suggests they are ammonium salts. Since the mixture is equimolar, we can deduce the specific formulas of the two ammonium salts (A and B) that would combine to match the overall empirical formula we found.\n\n4.  **Verify the Identification:** We will use the total initial mass (7.20 g) and the fact that the mixture is equimolar to confirm that our identified salts are correct. We'll calculate the moles of the mixture.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** Once salts A and B are identified, we will count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B and sum them up to get the final answer.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan with the Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the Products\n# Given data\nmass_mixture = 7.20  # g\nmass_H2O = 3.60      # g, from tube #1\nmass_O2 = 0.80       # g, from tube #3\nvolume_gas_C_STP = 2.24 # L\n\n# Molar masses and constants\nM_H = 1.008\nM_N = 14.007\nM_O = 15.999\nM_H2O = 2 * M_H + M_O\nM_O2 = 2 * M_O\nM_N2 = 2 * M_N\nV_molar_STP = 22.4 # L/mol\n\n# Calculate moles of each product\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nmoles_O2 = mass_O2 / M_O2\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C_STP / V_molar_STP\n\n# Check conservation of mass to identify gas C\n# Assuming gas C is N2, let's calculate its mass\nmass_gas_C_assumed_N2 = moles_gas_C * M_N2\ntotal_product_mass = mass_H2O + mass_O2 + mass_gas_C_assumed_N2\n\n# The total product mass (7.20 g) matches the initial mixture mass.\n# This confirms that gas C is Nitrogen (N2).\n\n# Step 2: Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture\n# Calculate total moles of each element from the products\nmoles_H_total = moles_H2O * 2\nmoles_O_total = moles_H2O * 1 + moles_O2 * 2\nmoles_N_total = moles_gas_C * 2\n\n# The molar ratio of elements in the mixture is H:N:O\n# H : N : O  ~=  0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25\n# To get integers, we multiply by 20, giving a ratio of 8:4:5.\n# So the overall formula of (A+B) is H8N4O5.\n\n# Step 3: Identify Salts A and B\n# The products (N2, H2O) suggest ammonium salts.\n# The overall formula H8N4O5 contains 8 H atoms, which corresponds to two ammonium ions, (NH4)2.\n# (NH4)2 = N2H8.\n# Subtracting this from the total formula leaves the anions: H8N4O5 - N2H8 = N2O5.\n# The two anions must sum to N2O5.

We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase is 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.008) + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This is a crucial point: it means **no acidic gases** were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2(16.00) = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with any of the reagents. Given that the original salts are likely nitrogen compounds (a common theme in such problems), and no other elements are suggested, Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Summary of Products:**\nThe decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B yielded:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.025 mol of O₂\n*   0.10 mol of N₂\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\nWe can find the total moles of each element (H, O, N) in the original mixture by summing the atoms from the products.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen comes from both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the composition and find the formulas of the salts.**\nLet's check if the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\nThe problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. Let 'n' be the number of moles of salt A and also the number of moles of salt B.\nThe total moles of elements can be expressed as:\n*   n × (N atoms in A + N atoms in B) = 0.20 mol\n*   n × (H atoms in A + H atoms in B) = 0.40 mol\n*   n × (O atoms in A + O atoms in B) = 0.25 mol\n\nFrom these equations, the ratio of the total number of atoms in the combined formula unit (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. The most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). The H:N ratio in the ammonium ion is 4:1. In our combined formula, the H:N ratio is 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1. However, if we consider that we have two salt molecules, we can propose that each contains one ammonium cation, NH₄⁺.\n*   Two NH₄⁺ ions would account for N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting this from the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ leaves N₂O₅ for the two anions.\n*   We need to split N₂O₅ into two common oxyanions of nitrogen. The most plausible combination is the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻) and the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻).\n    *   NO₂⁻ + NO₃⁻ = N₂O₅²⁻ (in terms of atoms)\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃\n\n**Step 4: Verify the decomposition reactions and molar masses.**\nLet's check if this identification is consistent with all the data.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula N₂H₄O₂. Molar Mass = 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Decomposition: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula N₂H₄O₃. Molar Mass = 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Decomposition at higher temperatures: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). This simplifies to: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + ½O₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nNow, let's find the number of moles, n.\nTotal mass = n × (Molar Mass of A) + n × (Molar Mass of B) = 7.20 g\nn × (64 + 80) = 7.20\nn × 144 = 7.20\nn = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\nLet's check the products from this mixture:\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃: 0.05 mol N₂, (0.05 × ½) = 0.025 mol O₂, and (0.05 × 2) = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n\nTotal products:\n*   N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Correct)\n*   H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol (Correct)\n*   O₂ = 0.025 mol (Correct)\nAll calculated values match the experimental results.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nAlternatively, using the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ we found in Step 3:\nTotal atoms = 4 (N) + 8 (H) + 5 (O) = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe user has provided the same problem again. The previous reasoning and code execution have already confirmed the solution. I will reiterate the final steps of the reasoning.\n\n**1. Identification of Salts:**\nBased on the products of decomposition (H₂O, N₂O, and N₂), the salts were identified as ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n*   Decomposition of Salt A (NH₄NO₃): NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n*   Decomposition of Salt B (NH₄NO₂): NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n\n**2. Verification of Moles and Mass:**\nThe analysis of the gas mixture showed that 0.05 moles of N₂O and 0.05 moles of N₂ were produced. Since the initial mixture was equimolar, this means the original mixture contained 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.20 g\n*   Total Mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given information.\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Atoms:**\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the weight change of each tube to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Weight increase = mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ **0.2 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change.\n    *   This indicates that **no CO₂** or other acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all the tubes, a gas C remains.\n    *   Volume of gas C = 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.1 mol**.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, an alkaline solution, or hot copper. This suggests it is a relatively inert gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂), which is a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n### 2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts\n\nNow, let's determine the mass and moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original 7.20 g mixture by looking at the atoms in the products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.2 mol = **0.4 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming gas C is N₂.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.1 mol = **0.2 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.2 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.2 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.4 mol H × 1.008 g/mol) + (0.2 mol N × 14.007 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.00 g/mol)\n*   Mass ≈ 0.4032 g + 2.8014 g + 4.00 g = 7.2046 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g), confirming our calculations and the identity of gas C as N₂.\n\n### 3. Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states we have an **equimolar mixture** of two salts, A and B. This means if we have 'n' moles of salt A, we also have 'n' moles of salt B. The total amount of the mixture contains 0.2 mol N, 0.4 mol H, and 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe ratio of the atoms in the combined formula unit of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\nTo get an integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined empirical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are decomposition products containing N, H, and O, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions (like nitrate or nitrite). Let's try to find two such salts that sum to the formula N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** The chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** The chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n\nLet's add their formulas together:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A = Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B = Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts was passed through three tubes. Let's analyze the change in each tube to identify the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g, which is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The oxygen must have come from a gaseous oxide that is not acidic and reacts with hot copper. The two common possibilities are nitrous oxide (N₂O) or oxygen (O₂). However, the problem states that a gas C remained *after* this tube. If the gas were O₂, it would be consumed, and it's unlikely that the initial mixture contained elemental nitrogen. A more plausible scenario is the reaction of N₂O with copper: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. In this reaction, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms to form CuO.\n    *   Therefore, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms came from **0.05 mol of N₂O**. This reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   The volume of the remaining gas is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C is the nitrogen (N₂) that passed through all the tubes. It consists of any N₂ produced directly from the decomposition plus the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper.\n    *   Total N₂ = N₂ (original) + N₂ (from N₂O reaction)\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂ (original) + 0.05 mol\n    *   So, the amount of N₂ produced directly from the decomposition is **0.05 mol**.\n\nTo summarize, the decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B yielded:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n### 2. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products is:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.05 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 1.40 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.60 + 2.20 + 1.40 = 7.20 g\n\nThis total mass is equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture. This confirms that the salts decomposed completely into these gaseous products.\n\nThe salts A and B are in an equimolar mixture. Let's assume `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B were heated.\nThe overall reaction is:\n`n`A + `n`B → 0.05 N₂ + 0.05 N₂O + 0.20 H₂O\n\nDividing the product moles by the smallest value (0.05) gives a ratio of 1 N₂ : 1 N₂O : 4 H₂O.\nThis suggests that the decomposition of one mole of A and one mole of B produces 1 mole of N₂, 1 mole of N₂O, and 4 moles of H₂O.\nLet's look for two common nitrogen-containing salts whose decomposition products match this. The most common salts that produce these gases are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nIf we have an equimolar mixture of these two salts, their combined decomposition is:\nNH₄NO₂ + NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + N₂O + 4H₂O\n\nThis perfectly matches the 1:1:4 molar ratio of the products we deduced. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\nLet's verify the moles. The reaction `n`A + `n`B produced 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.05 mol of N₂O. This means `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * (64.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * (80.0 g/mol) = 4.00 g\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (or B): Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (or A): Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in NH₄NO₂) + (Atoms in NH₄NO₃) = 8 + 9 = **17 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂), a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nFrom the moles of the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 mol H/mol H₂O = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 mol N/mol N₂ = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is present in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 mol O/mol H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 mol O/mol O₂)\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n\nLet's check if the mass of these elements equals the initial mass of the mixture:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that salts A and B consist only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B. The total moles of elements are the sum from both salts.\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get integers, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   N: 1, H: 2, O: 1.25. Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of salt A and salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the compounds are salts containing N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts. We need to find two common ammonium salts that add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\nLet's try combining ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃ → Formula: N₂H₄O₃\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂ → Formula: N₂H₄O₂\n\nSum of formulas = (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This matches our derived ratio.\n\nNow, let's verify this with the decomposition reactions. The thermal decomposition of these salts at around 200°C produces the observed gases:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g) (This is the primary reaction, but at higher temperatures or with impurities, it can also produce N₂ and O₂). A more complete decomposition that fits the products is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + 4H₂O + O₂.\n\nLet's assume the reactions are:\n*   n NH₄NO₂ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O\n*   n NH₄NO₃ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O + 0.5n O₂\n\nTotal products would be:\n*   Moles of N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.5n\n\nFrom our initial analysis, we have 0.10 mol N₂, 0.20 mol H₂O, and 0.025 mol O₂.\n*   2n = 0.10 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   4n = 0.20 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   0.5n = 0.025 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n\nThe value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nFinally, we count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of the Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a mixture of salts and passing the resulting gases through a series of tubes. We can identify the gaseous products and their quantities by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). The problem states the weight of this tube did not change. This implies that no CO₂ (or other acidic gas) was formed during the decomposition. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper (Cu) reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight (0.80 g) is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the gas mixture passes through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remain. The volume is given at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. The most common inert gas produced in chemical decompositions of nitrogen-containing compounds is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts**\n\nLet's verify our product identification by checking the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass is exactly equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identified products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are correct and that the original salts A and B are composed only of the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ended up in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ended up in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen ended up in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo get all integers, we multiply the ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe problem states that the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means that the combined chemical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B must correspond to the empirical formula N₄H₈O₅.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are very likely to be ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻).\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated from the experimental data. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\n**Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data to identify the products and their quantities.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect and absorb acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the identity of gas C and verify the law of conservation of mass.**\n\nThe total mass of the initial salt mixture was 7.20 g. This must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of gas C:\n*   Molar mass of C = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nThe elements present in the products are H (from H₂O), O (from H₂O and O₂), and the elements from gas C. Since no CO₂ was formed, there is no carbon. A gas with a molar mass of ~28 g/mol that is inert under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂), with a molar mass of 2 * 14.007 = 28.014 g/mol. This is a perfect match.\n\nSo, the gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n\n**3. Determine the overall stoichiometry of the decomposition.**\n\nWe have the molar amounts of all products:\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.025 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol\n\nTo find the simplest whole-number ratio, we divide all values by the smallest value (0.025):\n*   N₂ : 0.10 / 0.025 = 4\n*   O₂ : 0.025 / 0.025 = 1\n*   H₂O : 0.20 / 0.025 = 8\n\nThe overall stoichiometric ratio of the products is 4N₂ : 1O₂ : 8H₂O.\n\n**4. Identify salts A and B.**\n\nThe original salts A and B decomposed to produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O. This means they must be composed of Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Hydrogen. Since they are salts, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions. The most common candidates are:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nLet's examine their decomposition reactions:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)  *(Note: This decomposition occurs at higher temperatures, consistent with the production of O₂)*\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of A and B. Let's assume we have `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produces: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produces: `n` moles of N₂, `n/2` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `n/2`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nThe molar ratio of the products from this mixture is (2n) : (n/2) : (4n). Multiplying by 2 to clear the fraction gives 4 : 1 : 8. This perfectly matches the ratio we derived from the experimental data. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**5. Calculate the number of atoms.**\n\nNow we can find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (e.g., Ammonium Nitrate): NH₄NO₃**\n    *   Number of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₃⁻) = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen (O) atoms = 3\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (e.g., Ammonium Nitrite): NH₄NO₂**\n    *   Number of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₂⁻) = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen (O) atoms = 2\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n*   Total atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nTo be certain, we can quickly verify the initial mass using the value of `n`. From the product data, we know that 0.025 moles of O₂ were produced.\n*   Moles of O₂ = `n/2` = 0.025 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   So, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Mass(NH₄NO₃) = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.002 g\n*   Mass(NH₄NO₂) = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g\n*   Total mass = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given 7.20 g.\n\nThe reasoning is consistent and all data points are satisfied.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the decomposition products to deduce the composition of the original salts.\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe gas mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through three tubes. The change in weight of each tube tells us what was absorbed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of H₂O produced is 3.60 g.\n    *   To find the moles of water, we use its molar mass (≈18.0 g/mol).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: it means **no CO₂ was produced**. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain the element Carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO). The increase in the tube's mass is due to the captured oxygen.\n    *   The mass of O₂ produced is 0.80 g.\n    *   To find the moles of oxygen, we use its molar mass (32.0 g/mol).\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper, and we know the salts don't contain carbon, the most plausible identity for this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nLet's verify our product identification by checking the law of conservation of mass.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Products** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**\n\nThis total mass perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms our products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are correct and that the original salts A and B are composed only of the elements **Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O)**.\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ended up in N₂. Moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol N**.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ended up in H₂O. Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol H**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen ended up in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have the molar ratio of the elements in the entire mixture: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\n*   N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n*   N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe problem states that the initial substance was an **equimolar mixture** of two salts, A and B. This means the combined chemical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B must be **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are very likely to be ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻). Let's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are **ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a classic stoichiometry problem that can be solved by carefully analyzing the products of the thermal decomposition. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed and passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the mass change of each tube to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the weight of this tube did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of the tube (0.80 g) is the mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is non-reactive towards water absorbers, bases, and hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Volume of N₂ = 2.24 L\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n\n### 2. Verify Mass Conservation and Identify the Salts\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products should equal the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.1 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Gases** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g\n\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture perfectly, confirming our analysis of the products is correct. The decomposition of salts A and B yields H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen points towards ammonium salts, and the presence of oxygen suggests nitrate or nitrite anions.\n\nLet's examine the decomposition of likely candidates:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes to produce nitrogen and water:\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Its decomposition can be complex. While it often produces N₂O and H₂O, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, it can decompose to nitrogen, oxygen, and water:\n    2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states it's an equimolar mixture. Let's assume salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate. Let 'x' be the number of moles for each salt.\n*   From `x` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `x` moles of N₂ and `2x` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `x` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `x` moles of N₂, `0.5x` moles of O₂, and `2x` moles of H₂O (based on the second reaction, per mole of NH₄NO₃).\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = x + x = 2x\n*   Total H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5x\n\nThe molar ratio of the products is N₂ : H₂O : O₂ = 2x : 4x : 0.5x, which simplifies to **4 : 8 : 1**.\n\nLet's compare this to the experimental ratio from Step 1:\n*   N₂ : H₂O : O₂ = 0.1 mol : 0.2 mol : 0.025 mol\n*   Dividing by the smallest value (0.025), we get the ratio **4 : 8 : 1**.\n\nThe ratios match perfectly. Therefore, the salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts was passed through a series of tubes, and the change in mass of each tube tells us what gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of this tube increased by 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂) or sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which would form a precipitate. The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n### **2. Identifying the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe decomposition produced water, a non-reactive gas (C), and an oxygen-containing gas that reacted with copper. The presence of nitrogen in many thermally unstable salts, along with the products, suggests the gases are related to nitrogen compounds.\n\n*   The most common non-reactive gas produced in such decompositions is nitrogen (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n*   The oxygen-containing gas that reacted with copper (providing 0.05 mol of O atoms) and would likely produce N₂ as a byproduct is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   From this reaction, 0.05 moles of N₂O would produce the 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms that formed CuO. This reaction would also produce 0.05 moles of N₂.\n*   The total amount of N₂ (Gas C) collected was 0.10 mol. Since 0.05 mol of N₂ came from the reaction of N₂O with copper, the other 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been produced directly from the initial decomposition.\n\nSo, the gases formed by heating the salts were:\n*   **0.20 mol of H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂**\n\n### **3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂O, and N₂) are characteristic of the thermal decomposition of specific ammonium salts.\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) yields nitrous oxide and water: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O.\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) yields nitrogen gas and water: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nLet's assume Salt A is **NH₄NO₃** and Salt B is **NH₄NO₂**. The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar (contained an equal number of moles of each salt). Let's verify if this matches our findings.\n\n*   Let 'x' be the moles of each salt.\n*   Decomposition of x moles of NH₄NO₃ produces x moles of N₂O and 2x moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of x moles of NH₄NO₂ produces x moles of N₂ and 2x moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Moles of N₂O = x\n*   Moles of N₂ = x\n*   Moles of H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x\n\nFrom our analysis in step 2, we found:\n*   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol  => x = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol   => x = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol  => 4x = 4(0.05) = 0.20 mol\n\nThe values are consistent. Therefore, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\nLet's check the initial mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Separation Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture from the changes in weight of these tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase is 3.60 g, which is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change (Δm = 0).\n    *   This means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed, confirming this reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, a gas C remains.\n    *   Volume at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe total mass of the initial salts was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\nTotal mass of gases = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n7.20 g = 4.40 g + Mass(Gas C)\nMass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\nMolar Mass(Gas C) = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nGas C is inert to the reagents in the tubes and has a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol. The most common gas fitting this description is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nThe elements in the gaseous products (N, H, O) must have originated from the initial salts A and B. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles H = 2 × Moles H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂.\n    *   Moles O = (1 × Moles H₂O) + (2 × Moles O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles N = 2 × Moles N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\nSo, the total elemental mole ratio in the 7.20 g mixture is N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get a simpler integer ratio, we can multiply by 20: N:H:O = 4 : 8 : 5.\nThe combined empirical formula of the salt mixture is N₄H₈O₅.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means the total number of moles of A is equal to the total number of moles of B. Let this be 'n' moles for each. The combined formula (A+B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nThe salts contain N, H, and O. A very common cation containing N and H is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms in the combined formula can be accounted for by two NH₄⁺ ions (one for each salt).\n*   Salt A = NH₄⁺ + Anion A⁻\n*   Salt B = NH₄⁺ + Anion B⁻\n\nThe remaining atoms to form the two anions are N₂O₅ (from N₄H₈O₅ - 2×NH₄). We need to split N₂O₅ into two anions, each with a -1 charge. The most common and chemically sensible anions from these atoms are:\n*   Nitrite ion: NO₂⁻\n*   Nitrate ion: NO₃⁻\nAdding these together gives N₂O₅²⁻, which balances the two NH₄⁺ cations.\n\nSo, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\nLet's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these salts matches the observed products.\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   A known decomposition for NH₄NO₃ at ~200°C is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + 4H₂O + O₂ (or NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 2H₂O + ½ O₂)\n\nLet's assume the mixture contained 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   Products from NH₄NO₂: n mol N₂, 2n mol H₂O\n*   Products from NH₄NO₃: n mol N₂, 2n mol H₂O, 0.5n mol O₂\n*   Total products:\n    *   N₂: n + n = 2n\n    *   H₂O: 2n + 2n = 4n\n    *   O₂: 0.5n\n\nFrom our initial analysis, we found: Moles N₂ = 0.10, Moles H₂O = 0.20, Moles O₂ = 0.025.\n*   2n = 0.10 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n*   4n = 0.20 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n*   0.5n = 0.025 mol => n = 0.05 mol\n\nThe results are consistent, confirming our hypothesis. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. The total mass is (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) = 3.2 g + 4.0 g = 7.2 g, which matches the given information.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the problem statement and chemical principles.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed upon heating the salts and is then passed through a series of tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent, used to absorb water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g is equal to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, indicating the absence of CO₂ or other acidic gases (like SO₂ or most nitrogen oxides).\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper**\n    *   Hot copper can react with oxygen or oxygen-containing compounds like nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form copper oxide (CuO).\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (Gas C) remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, an alkali solution, or hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Identifying the Gaseous Products of Decomposition\n\nFrom the analysis above, we need to identify the initial gases produced by heating the salts. The gases contained 0.20 mol of H₂O, 0.10 mol of N₂, and a gas that supplied 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms to the hot copper.\n\nThe gas that reacted with copper was likely nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is:\nN₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO\n\nThis reaction explains the observations perfectly:\n*   It provides the 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms that caused the 0.80 g mass increase in tube №3.\n*   For this to happen, 0.05 mol of N₂O must have been present in the initial gas mixture.\n*   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n\nThe total amount of N₂ gas (Gas C) collected at the end was 0.10 mol. Since 0.05 mol of this N₂ came from the decomposition of N₂O in tube №3, the other 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been present in the original gas mixture from the start.\n\nTherefore, the thermal decomposition of salts A and B produced:\n*   **0.20 mol of H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂**\n\n### 3. Identifying Salts A and B\n\nThe salts decomposed completely into a mixture of H₂O, N₂O, and N₂. This composition points towards ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen. The two most common salts that produce these gases upon heating are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. Let's assume *n* moles of salt A and *n* moles of salt B were heated.\n*   From *n* moles of NH₄NO₃, we get *n* moles of N₂O and 2*n* moles of H₂O.\n*   From *n* moles of NH₄NO₂, we get *n* moles of N₂ and 2*n* moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products would be:\n*   Moles of N₂O = *n*\n*   Moles of N₂ = *n*\n*   Moles of H₂O = 2*n* + 2*n* = 4*n*\n\nComparing this with our findings from the gas analysis:\n*   Moles of N₂O = *n* = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂ = *n* = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 4*n* = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol\n\nThe results are perfectly consistent, confirming that the mixture contained 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂.\n\n### 4. Verifying the Initial Mass\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 80.06 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 64.06 g/mol\n\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol × 80.06 g/mol = 4.003 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol × 64.06 g/mol = 3.203 g\n*   Total Mass = 4.003 g + 3.203 g = 7.206 g\n\nThis matches the initial weight of 7.20 g.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in one molecule of each.\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** First, we'll use the information from the experiment to determine the chemical nature and quantity (in moles) of the gases produced by heating the salt mixture.\n    *   The weight increase in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   The weight increase in the tube with red-hot copper corresponds to the mass of oxygen (O₂) produced.\n    *   The fact that the Ca(OH)₂ tube's weight did not change means no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced.\n    *   The remaining gas, C, which is inert to all previous traps, is most likely nitrogen (N₂). We can calculate its moles from the given volume at STP.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reactants (Salts A and B):** Based on the products (H₂O, O₂, N₂), we can deduce the original salts. The absence of a solid residue and the production of these specific gases strongly suggest the decomposition of two ammonium salts:\n    *   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes to N₂ + 2H₂O.\n    *   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Decomposes to N₂ + 0.5 O₂ + 2H₂O (this is one of its decomposition pathways, which fits the products).\n\n3.  **Verify with Stoichiometry:** We'll assume the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃ and that they were in an equimolar mixture. We can calculate the moles of each salt (`n`) using the moles of any of the products (e.g., N₂). Then, we will use this value of `n` to predict the quantities of the other products (O₂ and H₂O) and the total initial mass of the mixture. If our predictions match the experimental data, our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Once salts A and B are confirmed to be NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃, we will count the number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.

We analyze the results from each tube to identify the components of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent (desiccant) that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g. This means the mass of water produced is 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to test for acidic gases, most commonly CO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, it means there were no acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ in the mixture. This tells us the original salts do not contain carbon or sulfur that would form these oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases containing oxygen, such as O₂, N₂O, or NO. The problem states that CuO is formed, and the mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the previous reagents. Given that we are dealing with nitrogen-containing salts, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Reconstruct the gas mixture before it entered Tube №3.**\nThe gas entering Tube №3 was a mixture of the oxidizing gas and the inert Gas C (N₂). The reaction in Tube №3 removed 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. The gas leaving the tube was 0.10 mol of N₂. Let's consider the possible oxidizing gas.\n\nA very common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts that reacts with hot copper is nitrous oxide (N₂O).\nReaction: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂\n*   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms to form CuO, we must have started with 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n*   The reaction of 0.05 mol of N₂O also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The total N₂ collected at the end is 0.10 mol. This total consists of the N₂ produced in the reaction (0.05 mol) and any N₂ that was present in the original gas mixture and passed through unreacted.\n*   Initial N₂ = Total N₂ - Produced N₂ = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the gas mixture produced from the initial decomposition consisted of:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n**Step 3: Identify the salts A and B.**\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B was heated. Let's assume we have `x` moles of salt A and `x` moles of salt B. We need to find two salts whose decomposition in a 1:1 molar ratio produces the calculated amounts of gases. Common ammonium salts that decompose into these products are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Salt A = Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** The decomposition reaction is NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O.\n*   **Salt B = Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** The decomposition reaction is NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nIf we start with `x` moles of each:\n*   `x` mol NH₄NO₃ produces `x` mol N₂O and `2x` mol H₂O.\n*   `x` mol NH₄NO₂ produces `x` mol N₂ and `2x` mol H₂O.\n\nThe total products would be:\n*   `x` mol of N₂O\n*   `x` mol of N₂\n*   `2x + 2x = 4x` mol of H₂O\n\nComparing this to our findings from Step 2:\n*   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol  => `x` = 0.05\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol  => `x` = 0.05\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol  => `4x` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\nThe results are perfectly consistent with `x = 0.05`. Therefore, the initial mixture was 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the total mass.**\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01*2 + 1.008*4 + 16.00*3 = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01*2 + 1.008*4 + 16.00*2 = 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol ≈ 4.00 g.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol ≈ 3.20 g.\n*   Total mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given total mass, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nThe reasoning and thinking process has been successfully completed, and the calculations have been verified by the Python code execution. The steps were:\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data** to determine the products of the decomposition and their molar quantities.\n    *   The mass increase in the Mg(ClO₄)₂ tube (3.60 g) corresponds to 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   The lack of mass change in the Ca(OH)₂ tube indicates no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed.\n    *   The mass increase in the hot copper tube (0.80 g) corresponds to 0.025 mol of O₂.\n    *   The remaining gas volume (2.24 L at STP) corresponds to 0.10 mol of an inert gas, identified as N₂.\n2.  **Verify the product masses** against the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). The sum of the masses of H₂O (3.60 g), O₂ (0.80 g), and N₂ (2.80 g) equals 7.20 g, confirming the product identification.\n3.  **Deduce the identity of the salts**. Based on the product elements (H, N, O) and the fact that they are salts, ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) were hypothesized.\n4.  **Write the decomposition reactions** and test the hypothesis using the \"equimolar mixture\" condition.\n    *   Reaction 1: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Reaction 2: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n    *   It was calculated that an equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ would produce the exact quantities of N₂, O₂, and H₂O observed experimentally. This confirms that salts A and B are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n5.  **Calculate the final answer**. The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the mass changes in the tubes**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were formed.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the remaining gas C**\n\n*   A total of 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n*   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n*   The total initial mass of the salt mixture was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert to the reagents used is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the elemental composition of the initial mixture**\n\nThe gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The atoms in these products must have come from the initial salts A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** from 0.2 mol of H₂O = 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** from 0.1 mol of N₂ = 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** from 0.2 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ = (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives N₈H₁₆O₁₀, or more simply, multiply by 4 (the inverse of the smallest fraction 0.25) to clear the decimal which gives N₄H₈O₅.\n\n### **Step 4: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts. The combined chemical formula is N₄H₈O₅. The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen strongly suggests the presence of the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺).\n\n*   The H₈ part of the formula corresponds to two ammonium ions: 2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈²⁺.\n*   The remaining atoms are N₂O₅. These must form the anions.\n*   The most common nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions) are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   The sum of these two anions is (NO₃⁻) + (NO₂⁻) = N₂O₅²⁻.\n*   Combining the cations and anions, we get the two salts: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nSo, Salt A is **NH₄NO₃** and Salt B is **NH₄NO₂**.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₃⁻) = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₂⁻) = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts =** Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water. The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). The fact that its weight did not change indicates that no CO₂ was produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After the removal of water and oxygen, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Given the starting materials are salts, this inert gas is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nFrom the products, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol H\n*   **Oxygen (O):** (moles of H₂O) + 2 × (moles of O₂) = 0.2 mol + 2 × 0.025 mol = 0.25 mol O\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol N\n\nThe total mass of the products is (3.60 g H₂O) + (0.80 g O₂) + (0.1 mol × 28.02 g/mol N₂) = 7.20 g, which matches the initial mass of the salts.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that the initial substance is an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, and that only gases are formed upon heating. The absence of a solid residue suggests the salts do not contain metal cations. The most plausible cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The anions must be composed of nitrogen and oxygen.\n\nLet's look at the molar ratio of the elements in the mixture: N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.05, which is half the moles of N₂), which gives N₄H₈O₅.\n\nSince we have an equimolar (1:1) mixture of two salts, A and B, the combined formula (A + B) must be N₄H₈O₅. The presence of 8 hydrogen atoms suggests two ammonium (NH₄⁺) cations in total, one for each salt. The remaining atoms, N₂O₅, must form the two anions. The most common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n*   Anion 1: NO₂⁻\n*   Anion 2: NO₃⁻\n\nCombining these with the ammonium cation gives the two salts:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nLet's check the combined formula: NH₄NO₂ + NH₄NO₃ = N₂H₄O₂ + N₂H₄O₃ = N₄H₈O₅. This matches our derived composition. The decomposition of ammonium nitrite produces nitrogen and water (NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O). The decomposition of ammonium nitrate at around 200°C can produce nitrous oxide and water (NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O) or, at slightly higher temperatures, nitrogen, oxygen, and water (2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O). Both decomposition pathways for ammonium nitrate are consistent with the experimental data, as any N₂O produced would also react with the hot copper to yield N₂ and CuO.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 (in Salt A) + 9 (in Salt B) = 17 atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the products of the thermal decomposition.**\n\nThe gaseous mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes, allowing us to identify the components and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no acidic gases like CO₂ or NO₂ were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent and reacts with oxidizing gases like oxygen (O₂) or nitrogen oxides (e.g., N₂O, NO). The reaction forms copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that combined with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the previous reagents, which strongly suggests it is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g) by the law of conservation of mass. We can find the mass of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles from H₂O) + (moles from reaction with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.00 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen, as no other elements are indicated.\n    *   Mass of N = Total mass - Mass of H - Mass of O = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.01 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n**3. Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe problem states that A and B are salts and form an equimolar mixture. Since the elements are N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. A salt consists of a cation and an anion.\n\n*   The cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺).\n*   Let's check if the salts each contain one ammonium ion. An equimolar mixture of NH₄⁺A⁻ and NH₄⁺B⁻ would have a combined formula of N₂H₈(A'B').\n*   Our elemental mole ratio for the entire mixture is H:N:O = 0.40:0.20:0.25. To get integers, we multiply by 20, which gives H₈N₄O₅.\n*   The formula for the combined pair of salt molecules (A+B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n*   If we assume both salts have one NH₄⁺ cation, we use N₂H₈ for the cations. The remaining atoms for the two anions are N₂O₅.\n*   We need to split N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-based anions. The logical choices are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   Anion 1: NO₂⁻ (uses 1 N, 2 O)\n    *   Anion 2: NO₃⁻ (uses 1 N, 3 O)\n    *   Total atoms used in anions: 2 N, 5 O. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Verify with the decomposition reactions.**\n\nLet's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these salts matches the observed products. The standard thermal decompositions are:\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n\nSince the mixture is equimolar, let's say we have `n` moles of each. The overall reaction is:\n`n`NH₄NO₂ + `n`NH₄NO₃ → `n`N₂ + `n`N₂O + 4`n`H₂O\n\nFrom our analysis, we found 0.20 mol of H₂O was produced.\n*   4`n` = 0.20 mol ⇒ `n` = 0.05 mol.\n\nThis means the decomposition produced:\n*   `n` = 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   `n` = 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n*   4`n` = 0.20 mol of H₂O (which is 3.6 g).\n\nNow let's trace the gases through the tubes:\n*   The N₂O gas (0.05 mol) reacts with the hot copper. It contains 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms (mass = 0.05 * 16 = 0.80 g), matching the mass gain of tube №3. The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This produces another 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The final gas C is the sum of the original N₂ and the N₂ produced from N₂O: 0.05 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.10 mol N₂. This matches the 2.24 L of remaining gas.\n*   Let's check the initial mass:\n    *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ (molar mass ≈ 64 g/mol) = 0.05 × 64 = 3.20 g.\n    *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (molar mass ≈ 80 g/mol) = 0.05 × 80 = 4.00 g.\n    *   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given total weight.\n\nThe identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the information from the gas purification train.**\n    The mixture of gases formed from the decomposition of salts A and B is passed through three tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H2O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of H2O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H2O = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H2O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO2 or SO2. Since the weight of the tube did not change, we can conclude that no such acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent and will react with oxidizing gases. The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This increase is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that combined with the copper to form copper oxide (CuO).\n        *   Molar mass of oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = mass / molar mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        The oxidizing gas must have provided these 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms. Common oxidizing gases containing N and O are N2O or NO. The reaction with N2O is `Cu + N2O -> CuO + N2`. The reaction with O2 is `2Cu + O2 -> 2CuO`.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        This gas C is inert to all the reagents, which strongly suggests it is dinitrogen (N2).\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n    The salts A and B decomposed completely into gases. By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass and elemental composition of the gaseous products must be the same as the initial 7.20 g salt mixture. The products contain hydrogen (from H2O), oxygen (from H2O and the oxidizing gas), and nitrogen (from the final gas C and possibly the oxidizing gas).\n\n    Let's find the total moles of each element in the gaseous products.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in H2O. Moles of H = 2 * moles of H2O = 2 * 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in H2O and the oxidizing gas. Moles of O = (moles of O in H2O) + (moles of O that reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** To find the moles of Nitrogen, we must first identify the oxidizing gas. Let's assume it's nitrous oxide (N2O), as this is a common decomposition product of ammonium salts.\n        *   Reaction in tube 3: `N2O + Cu -> CuO + N2`.\n        *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we must have started with 0.05 mol of N2O.\n        *   This reaction produces 0.05 mol of N2.\n        *   The total final N2 (gas C) is 0.10 mol. This means that in addition to the N2 produced from the N2O reaction, there must have been 0.05 mol of N2 in the initial gas mixture.\n        *   So, the original decomposition products were: 0.20 mol H2O, 0.05 mol N2O, and 0.05 mol N2.\n    *   Let's check the total mass of these products:\n        *   Mass = (0.20 mol * 18.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 28.0 g/mol)\n        *   Mass = 3.60 g + 2.20 g + 1.40 g = 7.20 g.\n        This matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our product identification.\n    *   Now, we can find the total moles of Nitrogen (N):\n        *   Moles of N = (2 * moles of N2O) + (2 * moles of N2) = (2 * 0.05) + (2 * 0.05) = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n\n3.  **Determine the combined formula of salts A and B.**\n    The initial 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol of H, 0.20 mol of N, and 0.25 mol of O. The molar ratio of the elements is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25.\n    To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\n    H : N : O = (0.40 * 20) : (0.20 * 20) : (0.25 * 20) = 8 : 4 : 5.\n    The empirical formula for the combined salts is H8N4O5.\n\n    The problem states we have an equimolar mixture of A and B. This means that the formula H8N4O5 represents the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    Formula(A) + Formula(B) = H8N4O5.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is the total number of atoms in the combined formula H8N4O5.\n    *   Total atoms = (number of H atoms) + (number of N atoms) + (number of O atoms)\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 4 + 5 = 17.\n\n*(Self-check: We can identify the salts A and B that fit this description. The decomposition products (N2, N2O, H2O) suggest ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\nSalt A: Ammonium nitrate, NH4NO3 (Formula: H4N2O3). Atoms = 4(H) + 2(N) + 3(O) = 9.\nSalt B: Ammonium nitrite, NH4NO2 (Formula: H4N2O2). Atoms = 4(H) + 2(N) + 2(O) = 8.\nCombined formula = H(4+4)N(2+2)O(3+2) = H8N4O5. This matches our derived formula.\nTotal atoms = Atoms(A) + Atoms(B) = 9 + 8 = 17. The result is consistent.)*\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental results to identify and quantify the gaseous products.**\n    *   The mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases (\"only a mixture of gases was formed\").\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect and absorb acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂). The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change. This is a critical piece of information, indicating that no CO₂ was present in the gas mixture.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n        *   The mass gain is the mass of oxygen atoms. Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) is 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, a base, or hot copper. This strongly suggests it is a relatively inert gas, like nitrogen (N₂), which is a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts. Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the gaseous products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B. Let's sum up the moles of each element produced:\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O → 0.20 mol × 2 = 0.40 mol of H atoms.\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ → (0.20 mol × 1) + (0.025 mol × 2) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol of O atoms.\n        *   **Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂ → 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol of N atoms.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the mass of these elements to see if it matches the initial mass:\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n        *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n        *   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   The calculated mass perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture. This confirms that salts A and B are composed solely of hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.\n\n3.  **Identify salts A and B.**\n    *   The problem states that A and B form an equimolar mixture.\n    *   The decomposition products (N₂, H₂O, O₂) and the absence of CO₂ or solid residue are characteristic of the thermal decomposition of certain ammonium salts. Let's consider two common ones:\n        *   Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂: Its decomposition is NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n        *   Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃: Its decomposition can vary with temperature. A known reaction is 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n    *   Let's hypothesize that salt A is NH₄NO₂ and salt B is NH₄NO₃. We can test this hypothesis.\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, so let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n    *   The total mass of the mixture is n × (M_A + M_B) = n × (64 + 80) = 144n.\n    *   We know the total mass is 7.20 g: 144n = 7.20 g → n = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n    *   Let's calculate the expected products from this mixture:\n        *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: produces 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 × 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n        *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 reaction): produces (2/2)×0.05 = 0.05 mol N₂, (1/2)×0.05 = 0.025 mol O₂, and (4/2)×0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n    *   Total products expected:\n        *   Total N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol.\n        *   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol.\n        *   Total H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n    *   These calculated amounts exactly match the amounts determined from the experimental data. Therefore, the salts A and B are indeed ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.**\n    *   The question asks for the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 nitrogen atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 nitrogen atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed.

The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g. This means 3.60 g of H₂O was produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO), via the reaction 2Cu(s) + O₂(g) → 2CuO(s). The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted. The mass increased by 0.80 g.\n        *   This mass increase is the mass of oxygen (O) atoms.\n        *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas exists as diatomic molecules (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ gas = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** The gas that did not react in any of the tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas is inert to a drying agent, a basic solution, and hot copper. This chemical behavior strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂), a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n    The gaseous products were H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This implies that the original salts A and B are composed of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). We can now calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n    *   **Total moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H atoms from the salts formed 0.20 mol of H₂O. Since each H₂O molecule contains 2 H atoms:\n        *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   **Total moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N atoms formed 0.10 mol of N₂. Since each N₂ molecule contains 2 N atoms:\n        *   Total moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Total moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are found in both the H₂O and O₂ produced.\n        *   Total moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O in O₂)\n        *   Total moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n    *   **Mass Verification:** Let's confirm that the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g).\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n        *   Total mass = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B.**\n    The problem states we have an \"equimolar mixture\" of salts A and B. This means that if we take one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B, their combined elemental formula must have the molar ratio we just calculated.\n    *   Molar ratio of elements in (A + B): N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n    *   To convert this to the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply all numbers by 20:\n        *   N: 0.20 × 20 = 4\n        *   H: 0.40 × 20 = 8\n        *   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n    *   Therefore, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n    We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that, when added together, give this formula. The most common ions are ammonium (NH₄⁺), nitrate (NO₃⁻), and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's try combining them:\n    *   Let Salt A be Ammonium Nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Let Salt B be Ammonium Nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\n    Let's check if their combined formula matches our derived formula:\n    (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N(₂₊₂)H(₄₊₄)O(₃₊₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    This is a perfect match. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n\n    *   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total atoms = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze what each tube tells us about the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** The mass increased by 3.60 g. Magnesium perchlorate is a powerful drying agent, which means it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** The mass of this tube did not change. Calcium hydroxide solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂, which would react to form a precipitate and increase the mass of the tube (e.g., CO₂ + Ca(OH)₂ → CaCO₃(s) + H₂O). The fact that the mass did not change strongly implies that no acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. This indicates that the gas mixture contained an oxidizing agent that reacted with copper. The mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Common gases from salt decomposition that can oxidize hot copper are O₂, N₂O, or NO. The oxygen atoms in these gases are the source of the mass increase.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained (at standard temperature and pressure, STP). This gas must be inert to all the previous reagents (Mg(ClO₄)₂, Ca(OH)₂, hot Cu).\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   A common inert gas produced in the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Deduce the Composition of the Initial Gas Mixture**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the initial gaseous products were H₂O, an oxidizing gas containing 0.05 mol of oxygen, and an inert gas which is likely N₂. Let's identify the oxidizing gas.\n\n*   Consider the decomposition of common nitrogen-containing salts. They often produce N₂ and N₂O. Let's hypothesize that the oxidizing gas is nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n    *   The reaction with copper is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n    *   This reaction provides one oxygen atom per molecule of N₂O.\n    *   Since 0.05 mol of O atoms reacted, there must have been **0.05 mol of N₂O**.\n    *   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n*   Now let's account for the final gas C (0.1 mol of N₂). This total amount of N₂ is the sum of N₂ produced directly from the salt decomposition and the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper.\n    *   Total N₂ = (Initial N₂) + (N₂ from N₂O reaction)\n    *   0.1 mol = (Initial N₂) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Initial N₂ = 0.1 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\nSo, the original mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was:\n*   **0.2 mol of H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂**\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe are looking for an equimolar mixture of two salts (A and B) that decompose upon heating to produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O in a 0.05 : 0.05 : 0.2 molar ratio (which simplifies to 1 : 1 : 4).\n\nLet's consider the decomposition of common ammonium salts:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nIf we have an equimolar mixture of these two salts, let's say 'n' moles of each:\n*   n NH₄NO₂ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O\n*   n NH₄NO₃ → n N₂O + 2n H₂O\n\nThe total products would be:\n*   n moles of N₂\n*   n moles of N₂O\n*   2n + 2n = 4n moles of H₂O\n\nThe molar ratio of the products (N₂ : N₂O : H₂O) is n : n : 4n, which simplifies to 1 : 1 : 4. This perfectly matches the ratio we deduced from the experimental data.\n\nTherefore, the salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Verify with Mass Data**\n\nFrom our product analysis, we found that n = 0.05 mol. Let's check if 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass, confirming our identification of the salts and their quantities.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their chemical formulas.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe detailed chemical analysis provided in the prompt allows for a step-by-step deduction of the identities of salts A and B.\n\n### Analysis of Gaseous Products\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent used to absorb water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂). The fact that the weight of the tube did not change indicates that no acidic gases were present in the mixture produced by the decomposition.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of the tube (0.80 g) corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted to form copper oxide (CuO).\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol\n    *   Since the gas is O₂, moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol\n\n4.  **Gas C (Remaining gas):** The remaining gas C has a volume of 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP), which corresponds to:\n    *   Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the products equals the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g). We can find the mass of gas C:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n\nNow, we can determine the molar mass of gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is inert to the reagents used is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe decomposition of the salt mixture produced H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This indicates the original salts were composed of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. As no solid residue was left, this points towards ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxoacids. The most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's examine their decomposition reactions:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** At temperatures around 200-250°C, the decomposition is 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). At lower temperatures, it primarily produces N₂O and H₂O. Given the products, the higher temperature decomposition is the relevant reaction.\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let's assume the mixture consists of `x` moles of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and `x` moles of salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe total moles of products would be:\n*   **From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂:** `x` mol N₂ + `2x` mol H₂O\n*   **From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃:** `x` mol N₂ + `0.5x` mol O₂ + `2x` mol H₂O\n\nThe total moles of each product from the mixture are:\n*   **Total N₂:** `x` + `x` = `2x`\n*   **Total H₂O:** `2x` + `2x` = `4x`\n*   **Total O₂:** `0.5x`\n\nThe ratio of the product moles is H₂O : N₂ : O₂ = `4x` : `2x` : `0.5x`, which simplifies to 8 : 4 : 1.\n\nLet's compare this to the experimental moles we calculated:\n*   n(H₂O) = 0.2 mol\n*   n(N₂) = 0.1 mol\n*   n(O₂) = 0.025 mol\n\nThe experimental ratio is 0.2 : 0.1 : 0.025, which also simplifies to 8 : 4 : 1. The perfect match confirms our hypothesis.\n\nNow, we can find the value of `x`:\n*   Using O₂: `0.5x` = 0.025 mol  => `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   Using N₂: `2x` = 0.1 mol => `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   Using H₂O: `4x` = 0.2 mol => `x` = 0.05 mol\n\nAll calculations consistently show that the mixture contained 0.05 moles of each salt.\n\nAs a final check, let's calculate the initial mass:\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol) = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### Calculation of Total Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 (from A) + 9 (from B) = 17 atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the mass changes in the tubes to identify the gaseous products.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase is due to the oxygen.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n**2. Identify the final remaining gas C.**\n\n*   Volume of gas C = 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n*   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n*   The total initial mass of the salts was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Total Mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(C)\n    *   Mass(C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n*   Now, we can find the molar mass of gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Determine the empirical formula of the combined salts.**\n\nThe decomposition produced 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂. Let's find the total moles of each element present in the original mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** 0.2 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.4 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** 0.1 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = 0.2 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** (0.2 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 O/O₂) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the initial mixture is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n*   N: 0.2 × 20 = 4\n*   H: 0.4 × 20 = 8\n*   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n\nSo, the combined empirical formula for (Salt A + Salt B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe problem states that A and B are salts in an equimolar mixture. We need to split the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   The presence of 8 hydrogen atoms strongly suggests two ammonium cations (NH₄⁺), which would account for 2 N and 8 H atoms.\n*   The remaining atoms are N₂O₅ (N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈). These must form the two anions for the salts.\n*   To balance the charge of the two NH₄⁺ cations (2 x +1 = +2), the two anions must have a total charge of -2.\n*   The most common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   Combining one nitrate and one nitrite gives (NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻) = N₂O₅²⁻. This perfectly matches the remaining atoms (2 N, 5 O) and the required total charge (-2).\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nNow, we find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each:\n*   Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThis is a stoichiometric problem that can be solved by analyzing the products of the thermal decomposition.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases was formed and passed through three tubes.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 15.999 ≈ 18.015 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ **0.20 mol**.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, we can conclude that no acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO was formed and the weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   The simplest oxidizing gas containing oxygen is O₂. If the gas was O₂, this would correspond to 0.05 mol / 2 = **0.025 mol of O₂**.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas. The most common inert gas from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B decomposed entirely into H₂O, O₂, and N₂. We can verify the law of conservation of mass:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total Mass of Gases = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the salts, confirming our analysis of the products.\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = **0.40 mol H**\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = **0.20 mol N**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 O/O₂) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**\n\n### Step 3: Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe salts contain Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and Oxygen. Common salts with these elements are ammonium salts like ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The problem states the mixture of salts A and B is equimolar (contains the same number of moles of each salt).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) → N₂ + 2H₂O**\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) → N₂ + ½O₂ + 2H₂O** (This decomposition pathway for NH₄NO₃ occurs at 250-300°C and fits the products observed).\n\nLet the mixture contain `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   Total moles of N₂ produced = `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = 2`n`\n*   Total moles of H₂O produced = 2`n` (from A) + 2`n` (from B) = 4`n`\n*   Total moles of O₂ produced = 0 (from A) + 0.5`n` (from B) = 0.5`n`\n\nFrom our product analysis, we know:\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.025 mol. So, 0.5`n` = 0.025 mol ⇒ `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   Let's check this with the other products:\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 2`n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches our findings).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 4`n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe identification is consistent. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) atom from NH₄⁺ + 1 Nitrogen (N) atom from NO₂⁻ = 2 N atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) atom from NH₄⁺ + 1 Nitrogen (N) atom from NO₃⁻ = 2 N atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of atoms in both salts is the sum of the atoms in each formula:\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes the analysis of the gaseous products formed when the salt mixture is heated. Let's determine the identity and amount of each gas.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂).\n    *   Weight change = 0 g.\n    *   This means no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas that reacted are: Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol O / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   *Alternative consideration:* Another gas that could react is N₂O (dinitrogen monoxide), via Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. In this case, 0.05 mol of N₂O would have reacted to provide 0.05 mol of O atoms. We will keep this in mind.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** The gas that passed through all tubes without reacting.\n    *   Volume of C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C is non-acidic, not water, and doesn't react with hot copper (or is the product of a reaction with copper). The most likely candidate, given that we are dealing with salts, is nitrogen gas (N₂), which is very inert.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nThe elements in the original salts must be the same as the elements in the gaseous products. Let's find the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** All O comes from H₂O and the O₂ that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol H₂O × (1 mol O / 1 mol H₂O) + 0.05 mol O (from tube 3) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** Assuming gas C is N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N.\n\nNow, let's verify these amounts by calculating the total mass and comparing it to the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass = 0.40 g + 4.00 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial weight of the mixture perfectly. Our assumptions about the products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the mixture is equimolar (moles of A = moles of B = n) and contains only H, N, and O atoms. The total mole ratio of elements in the mixture is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To get integers, multiply by 20: 8 : 4 : 5.\n\nThe combined formula of (A + B) is therefore proportional to H₈N₄O₅. We need to find two common nitrogen-containing salts (A and B) that add up to this formula. Let's consider ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids:\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: H₄N₂O₃)\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: H₄N₂O₂)\n\nLet's check if these two salts work:\n*   (Formula of A) + (Formula of B) = (H₄N₂O₃) + (H₄N₂O₂) = H₈N₄O₅.\nThis matches our derived elemental ratio. So, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\nWe can further verify this by checking the reaction stoichiometry. If n moles of each salt decompose:\n*   `n` NH₄NO₂(s) → `n` N₂(g) + `2n` H₂O(g)\n*   `n` NH₄NO₃(s) → `n` N₂(g) + `n/2` O₂(g) + `2n` H₂O(g) (This is one possible decomposition at higher temperatures)\nTotal products:\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n/2\nComparing with our experimental results:\n*   H₂O: 4n = 0.20 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   N₂: 2n = 0.10 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   O₂: n/2 = 0.025 mol → n = 0.05 mol\nAll calculations yield n = 0.05 mol, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Salt A (e.g., Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Number of N atoms = 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Number of H atoms = 4\n    *   Number of O atoms = 3\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (e.g., Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Number of N atoms = 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Number of H atoms = 4\n    *   Number of O atoms = 2\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in A and B:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Experimental Data\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent used to absorb water. The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced by the decomposition.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The weight did not change, which means no CO₂ was produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** The weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This weight gain is from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, which did not react in any of the tubes, has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. This gas is inert under the given conditions, strongly suggesting it is Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Identify the Gaseous Products\n\nThe initial salts completely decompose into a mixture of gases. Based on the analysis above, the products are:\n1.  **Water (H₂O):** 0.2 mol\n2.  **An oxidizing gas** that supplied 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n3.  **An inert gas (N₂):** which is the final product, Gas C.\n\nLet's deduce the identity of the oxidizing gas. Two common nitrogen-based gases from salt decomposition fit this description:\n*   **Case A: The gas is Nitrous Oxide (N₂O).** The reaction with copper would be: `N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO`.\n    *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.05 mol of N₂O is required.\n    *   This reaction would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   The final 0.1 mol of inert gas (N₂) would be composed of this newly formed 0.05 mol N₂ and another 0.05 mol of N₂ that was also an initial product of the decomposition.\n    *   So, the gaseous products from the initial decomposition would be: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n\n*   **Case B: The gas is Oxygen (O₂).** The reaction with copper is: `O₂ + 2Cu → 2CuO`.\n    *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we need 0.025 mol of O₂ gas.\n    *   The remaining 0.1 mol of inert gas would be N₂.\n    *   In this scenario, the products are: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂.\n\n### 3. Identify the Original Salts (A and B)\n\nThe decomposition products contain nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. This points towards ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxoanions, like ammonium nitrate or ammonium nitrite. Let's test the decomposition reactions of these salts.\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n\nNow, let's see if an equimolar mixture of these two salts matches the products we deduced in **Case A**. Let's assume we started with 'x' moles of Salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 'x' moles of Salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   `x NH₄NO₂(s) → x N₂(g) + 2x H₂O(g)`\n*   `x NH₄NO₃(s) → x N₂O(g) + 2x H₂O(g)`\n\n**Total Products:**\n*   **N₂:** x mol\n*   **N₂O:** x mol\n*   **H₂O:** 2x + 2x = 4x mol\n\nLet's compare this to our derived products from the experiment (Case A): 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.2 mol H₂O.\n\n*   If x = 0.05 mol, the predicted products are:\n    *   N₂: 0.05 mol\n    *   N₂O: 0.05 mol\n    *   H₂O: 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol\nThese values perfectly match the experimental results.\n\n### 4. Verify the Initial Mass\n\nLet's check if the total mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ equals the given starting mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) = 64.06 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 80.06 g/mol\n\n*   Mass of Salt A = 0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol = 3.203 g\n*   Mass of Salt B = 0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol = 4.003 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.203 g + 4.003 g = 7.206 g\n\nThis calculated mass is in excellent agreement with the initial 7.20 g. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** I will first determine the composition and molar quantities of the gaseous products based on the experimental data provided.\n    *   The mass increase in tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂) corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced. I'll calculate the moles of H₂O.\n    *   The weight of tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂) did not change, which means no acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ were formed.\n    *   The mass increase in tube №3 (hot copper) corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms from an oxidizing gas (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ -> 2CuO. I'll calculate the moles of O₂.\n    *   The remaining gas C (2.24 L at STP) passed through all tubes, indicating it's unreactive. Given the likely elements, this gas must be nitrogen (N₂). I'll calculate its moles.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Reactants (Salts A and B):**\n    *   The products (H₂O, N₂, O₂) are composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. This strongly suggests that salts A and B are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions.\n    *   I'll consider the decomposition reactions of common salts that fit this profile. Specifically, ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂), which decompose as follows:\n        *   `2 NH₄NO₃(s) → 2 N₂(g) + 4 H₂O(g) + O₂(g)`\n        *   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2 H₂O(g)`\n    *   This pair of reactions produces all the observed gases and no others.\n\n3.  **Solve for Quantities:**\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n    *   Oxygen (O₂) is only produced by the decomposition of ammonium nitrate. Using the moles of O₂ calculated in step 1, I can determine the moles of ammonium nitrate (`n`) in the initial mixture.\n    *   Since the mixture is equimolar, the moles of ammonium nitrite will also be `n`.\n\n4.  **Verify the Hypothesis:**\n    *   Using the calculated value of `n`, I will verify that the decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produces the exact amounts of N₂ and H₂O calculated in step 1.\n    *   I will also calculate the total initial mass of the mixture (`n` * M(NH₄NO₃) + `n` * M(NH₄NO₂)) and check if it equals the given 7.20 g.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Once salts A and B are confirmed to be NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂, I will count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n    *   The final answer will be the sum of the atoms in NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses of relevant atoms and molecules (in g/mol)\nM_H = 1.0\nM_N = 14.0\nM_O = 16.0\nM_H2O = 2 * M_H + M_O\nM_N2 = 2 * M_N\nM_O2 = 2 * M_O\n\n# --- Step 1: Analyze the gaseous products ---\nprint(\"Step 1: Determining the moles of each gaseous product.\")\n\n# Water (H2O) absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nprint(f\"The mass of water produced is {mass_H2O} g, which is {moles_H2O:.3f} moles of H2O.\")\n\n# Oxygen (O2) reacted with hot copper.

The gaseous products are analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds directly to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ (which would form a CaCO₃ precipitate) or SO₂. The fact that its weight did not change means that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition. This rules out salts like carbonates, sulfites, or most sulfates.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This weight increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The oxidizing gas must have supplied these 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms. Common oxidizing gases in such decompositions are O₂ or N₂O.\n        *   If the gas was O₂, we would have 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol of O₂.\n        *   If the gas was N₂O, we would have 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas C remains. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C did not react with a drying agent, limewater, or hot copper, indicating it's an inert gas like N₂.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the composition of the gaseous products.**\nLet's consider the two possibilities for the oxidizing gas.\n\n*   **Possibility A:** The oxidizing gas is N₂O. The reaction in tube №3 is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.05 mol of N₂O must have reacted.\n    *   This reaction would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   The total remaining gas C (0.10 mol) would be the sum of any inert gas produced directly from the salt decomposition and the 0.05 mol of N₂ produced in tube №3. This means the initial salt decomposition must have produced 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of an inert gas (likely N₂).\n    *   So, the initial gaseous products were: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** The oxidizing gas is O₂. The reaction in tube №3 is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.025 mol of O₂ must have reacted.\n    *   The remaining gas C (0.10 mol) would be the inert gas from the initial decomposition.\n    *   So, the initial gaseous products were: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\nPossibility A is more likely given the common decomposition products of nitrogen-containing salts. Let's proceed with this assumption and verify it.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the salts A and B.**\nThe products (H₂O, N₂O, N₂) strongly suggest that the original salts contain Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Common salts that fit this profile are ammonium salts of oxyanions of nitrogen.\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Decomposes upon heating: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes upon heating: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nLet's test if an equimolar mixture of these two salts (A and B) matches our findings. Let the mixture contain `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   From `n` mol of NH₄NO₂: `n` mol of N₂ and `2n` mol of H₂O are produced.\n*   From `n` mol of NH₄NO₃: `n` mol of N₂O and `2n` mol of H₂O are produced.\n\n**Total products from the mixture:**\n*   Total N₂ = `n` mol\n*   Total N₂O = `n` mol\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = `4n` mol\n\nNow, let's match this with our derived amounts from Step 2 (Possibility A):\n*   Total H₂O: `4n` = 0.20 mol  =>  `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   Total N₂O: `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   Total N₂: `n` = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three calculations yield a consistent value of `n = 0.05` mol. This confirms our hypothesis. The initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the total mass.**\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 2*14 + 4*1 + 2*16 = 28 + 4 + 32 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 2*14 + 4*1 + 3*16 = 28 + 4 + 48 = 80 g/mol.\n\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total mass of mixture = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem. The identification of salts A and B as ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate is correct.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe final question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in salts A and B** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful desiccant and absorbs water. The mass increase is due to the absorption of H₂O.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Moles of H₂O = `mass / molar mass` = `3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol` ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is lime water, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂. The mass did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the copper reacted with an oxidizing gas by taking its oxygen. The mass increase of the tube is equal to the mass of oxygen captured.\n    *   Mass of oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = `mass / molar mass` = `0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol` = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The production of H₂O and nitrogen-containing compounds suggests the original salts are nitrogen-based. A likely oxidizing gas is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O), which decomposes on hot copper: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂. This reaction delivers exactly one oxygen atom per molecule of N₂O. Therefore, the amount of N₂O gas must be 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C (remaining gas):** 2.24 L of a gas remains at STP. This gas did not react with any of the previous reagents.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = `volume / molar volume at STP` = `2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol` = 0.10 mol.\n    *   An inert gas under these conditions is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe gaseous products are H₂O (0.20 mol), N₂O (0.05 mol), and a final amount of N₂ (0.10 mol). The lack of C, S, etc., and the presence of N, H, and O strongly suggest that salts A and B are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. Let's hypothesize their identities based on common thermal decomposition reactions:\n*   Ammonium nitrite decomposition: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   Ammonium nitrate decomposition: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n\nLet's assume the equimolar mixture consists of `x` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `x` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**3. Stoichiometric Verification**\n\n*   **Total H₂O:** `x` mol NH₄NO₂ produces `2x` mol H₂O. `x` mol NH₄NO₃ produces `2x` mol H₂O. Total H₂O = `2x + 2x = 4x`.\n    *   We found `n(H₂O) = 0.20 mol`, so `4x = 0.20 mol` → `x = 0.05 mol`.\n\n*   **N₂O:** `x` mol of NH₄NO₃ produces `x` mol of N₂O.\n    *   If `x = 0.05 mol`, this gives 0.05 mol of N₂O. This matches our deduction from the mass gain of the copper tube.\n\n*   **Final N₂ (Gas C):** `x` mol of NH₄NO₂ produces `x` mol of N₂. The reaction of N₂O with copper (`N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂`) produces another `x` mol of N₂. Total N₂ = `x + x = 2x`.\n    *   If `x = 0.05 mol`, total N₂ = `2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol`. This matches the moles of Gas C.\n\n*   **Initial Mass:** The hypothesis holds for all products. Let's check the initial mass.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n    *   Total Mass = `mass(NH₄NO₃) + mass(NH₄NO₂)`\n    *   Total Mass = `(x * 80.04) + (x * 64.04)` = `0.05 * (80.04 + 64.04)` = `0.05 * 144.08` = 7.204 g. This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms in salts A and B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the composition of salts A and B and the total number of atoms.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Gaseous Products\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from heating the salts was passed through three tubes sequentially. We can identify the components of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water absorbed.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change indicates that no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) or readily soluble basic gases (like NH₃) were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    The oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas. Given the likely elements (N, H, O from salts), nitrous oxide (N₂O) is a strong candidate. The reaction is:\n    Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    According to this reaction, 0.05 moles of N₂O would react to provide the 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms, and this reaction would also produce 0.05 moles of nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    This remaining gas must be inert to all three tubes. Nitrogen (N₂) fits this description. This 0.1 mol of N₂ is the total amount collected at the end. It consists of any N₂ that was in the initial gas mixture plus the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction in tube №3.\n    *   Total N₂ = Initial N₂ + N₂ (from N₂O)\n    *   0.1 mol = Initial N₂ + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, Initial N₂ = 0.05 mol.\n\nBased on this analysis, the initial mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was:\n*   0.2 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n### 2. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe gaseous products are water, nitrous oxide, and nitrogen gas. This product mix strongly suggests the thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture of salts A and B was equimolar. Let's assume 'x' moles of each salt were present.\n*   Decomposition of 'x' moles of NH₄NO₃ produces 'x' moles of N₂O and '2x' moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of 'x' moles of NH₄NO₂ produces 'x' moles of N₂ and '2x' moles of H₂O.\n\nComparing this with our calculated moles of products:\n*   Moles of N₂O = x = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂ = x = 0.05 mol\nBoth equations yield x = 0.05 mol, which is consistent with the equimolar condition.\n\nNow, let's check the moles of water:\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2x (from NH₄NO₃) + 2x (from NH₄NO₂) = 4x\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 4 * (0.05 mol) = 0.2 mol.\nThis matches the amount of water calculated from the experiment in Tube №1.\n\n### 3. Verification of Total Mass\n\nLet's verify that the mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ equals the given total mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 2(14.01) + 4(1.01) + 3(16.00) = 80.06 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 2(14.01) + 4(1.01) + 2(16.00) = 64.06 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 4.003 g + 3.203 g = 7.206 g.\n\nThis value is in excellent agreement with the 7.20 g stated in the problem. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Total Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 nitrogen atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms.\n    Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 nitrogen atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms.\n    Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was passed through a series of tubes, allowing for the identification and quantification of the components:\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol = 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight of this tube did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted to form copper oxide (CuO).\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After the sequential removal of water and oxygen, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n    *   This remaining gas is non-reactive with the agents in the tubes, which strongly suggests it is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nTo confirm the identities of the products, we can check the mass balance. The total mass of the initial salt mixture was 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = 0.1 mol * 28.014 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of gaseous products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g\n\nThe total mass of the products equals the initial mass of the reactants, confirming that decomposition was complete and our product identification (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) is correct.\n\n**2. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe gaseous products contain nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. The original salts must therefore be composed of these elements. Since the problem describes salts that decompose completely into gases upon heating, ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyacids are strong candidates.\n\nLet's examine the molar ratios of the products:\n*   N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.1 mol : 0.025 mol : 0.2 mol\n*   Simplifying this ratio by dividing by the smallest value (0.025) gives: **4 : 1 : 8**\n\nNow, consider the thermal decomposition of likely salts:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes to produce nitrogen and water:\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** At higher temperatures (above 250-300°C), its decomposition primarily produces nitrogen, oxygen, and water:\n    2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture of salts A and B was equimolar. Let's assume we have 'n' moles of Salt A and 'n' moles of Salt B. If we hypothesize that the salts are ammonium nitrate (A) and ammonium nitrite (B):\n*   **From n moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio):**\n    *   n moles of N₂\n    *   0.5n moles of O₂\n    *   2n moles of H₂O\n*   **From n moles of NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   n moles of N₂\n    *   2n moles of H₂O\n\nCombining the products from the equimolar mixture:\n*   **Total N₂** = n + n = 2n\n*   **Total O₂** = 0.5n\n*   **Total H₂O** = 2n + 2n = 4n\n\nThe predicted molar ratio of the products from this mixture is **N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 2n : 0.5n : 4n**, which simplifies to **4 : 1 : 8**. This perfectly matches the experimentally determined ratio.\n\nWe can now find the value of 'n' using the known moles of any product:\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n\nThis confirms the initial mixture contained 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrate and 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrite.\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two identified salts.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\nThe total number of atoms in both salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Products of the Decomposition\n\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated, forming only a mixture of gases. This gas mixture was passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Copper reacts with oxygen to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   This means 0.80 g of oxygen atoms (O) were in the gas mixture.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as a diatomic molecule (O₂) in the gas, the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After the other components were removed, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n### 2. Identify Gas C\n\nWe can determine the molar mass of Gas C using the law of conservation of mass. The initial mass of the salts (7.20 g) must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol is most likely nitrogen gas (N₂), which has a molar mass of 28.02 g/mol. Nitrogen is also inert under the conditions in the tubes, which is consistent with the observations.\n\n### 3. Determine the Empirical Formula of the Salts\n\nThe original salts A and B decomposed into 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂. From this, we can find the total amount of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = (0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To convert this to a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**.\n\n### 4. Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe salts are in an equimolar mixture. This means for every mole of salt A, there is one mole of salt B. The combined empirical formula of one unit of A plus one unit of B is N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   The presence of 8 hydrogen atoms suggests the presence of two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), as 2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n*   If we assign two NH₄⁺ ions, the remaining atoms for the two anions are N₄₋₂O₅, or N₂O₅.\n*   We need to split the N₂O₅ composition into two separate, common anions. The most logical split is into a nitrate ion (NO₃⁻) and a nitrite ion (NO₂⁻).\n\nThis leads to the identification of the two salts:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions. At elevated temperatures, ammonium nitrite decomposes to nitrogen and water:\nNH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nThe decomposition of ammonium nitrate typically yields N₂O and H₂O. However, at higher temperatures or in the presence of other substances, it can decompose completely to nitrogen, oxygen, and water, which matches the observed products.\n2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O, or per mole: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nThis combination of salts and their decomposition pathways perfectly matches all the quantitative data from the experiment.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 (in A) + 9 (in B) = 17 atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the reaction and products**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The gaseous products are passed through a series of tubes to identify and quantify them.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   To find the moles of water: Moles = Mass / Molar Mass.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2*(1.008) + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃).\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, which means no CO₂ or other acidic gases were present in the product mixture. This tells us the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO was formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This increase is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from molecular oxygen (O₂) or another oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n        *   If it was O₂, the reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol, which contains 0.05 mol of O atoms.\n        *   If it was N₂O, the reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol, which contains 0.05 mol of O atoms.\n    *   In either case, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms were transferred to the copper.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C**\n    *   The remaining gas does not react with any of the previous reagents. Its volume is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the products (H₂O, O-containing gas), the salts likely contain N, H, and O. A common inert gas from the decomposition of such salts is nitrogen gas (N₂). So, we can confidently assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial mixture**\n\nFrom the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N ends up as the final gas N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and the species that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles of O in H₂O) + (Moles of O captured by Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's check if the total mass of these elements matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly. Thus, salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. This points towards ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen oxyanions (like NO₂⁻ or NO₃⁻). Let's consider the decomposition of these salts.\n\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃(s). Its decomposition depends on temperature. At around 200°C, the main reaction is NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g). N₂O is an oxidizing gas that would react with hot copper.\n\nLet's hypothesize that A = **NH₄NO₂** and B = **NH₄NO₃**. The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B.\n\nLet's trace the products from this hypothetical mixture:\n*   n moles of NH₄NO₂ decomposes to: n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   n moles of NH₄NO₃ decomposes to: n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nThe total initial products would be:\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n moles.\n*   Gases to be passed over hot copper: n moles of N₂ (from A) and n moles of N₂O (from B).\n\nNow, let's match this to our experimental data:\n*   From H₂O: Moles of H₂O = 4n = 0.20 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**.\n*   From Tube 3: n moles of N₂O react with Cu. This involves the transfer of n moles of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Moles of O captured by Cu = n = 0.05 mol. This is a perfect match.\n*   From Gas C: The N₂ gas from A (n moles) passes through unreacted. The N₂O from B reacts to form N₂ (n moles).\n    *   Total final N₂ = n (from A) + n (from B's product) = n + n = 2n.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.05 mol = 0.10 mol. This also matches perfectly.\n\nAll data are consistent with the mixture being 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4.

In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 17\nB) 13\nC) 19\nD) 15\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\n    The experiment is designed to identify the gases produced when the mixture of salts A and B is heated.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 1.008*2 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The mass of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted. So, 0.80 g of O₂ was produced.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ ≈ 16.00*2 = 32.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After removing H₂O and O₂, 2.24 L of a gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). The gas did not react with a desiccant, a base, or hot copper. This suggests a non-reactive gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n    *   **Summary of Products:** The decomposition of salts A and B produced 0.20 mol of H₂O, 0.025 mol of O₂, and 0.10 mol of N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\n    Since the products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂, the original salts must contain the elements Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). Let's calculate the total amount of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Total moles of H atoms:** From 0.20 mol H₂O, there are 0.20 * 2 = 0.40 mol of H.\n    *   **Total moles of N atoms:** From 0.10 mol N₂, there are 0.10 * 2 = 0.20 mol of N.\n    *   **Total moles of O atoms:** Oxygen comes from both H₂O and O₂.\n        *   From H₂O: 0.20 mol of O.\n        *   From O₂: 0.025 * 2 = 0.05 mol of O.\n        *   Total moles of O = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol of O.\n\n    *   **Verify Mass:** Let's check if the masses of these elements sum to the initial mass.\n        *   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.008 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.007 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.00 g/mol)\n        *   Mass ≈ 0.403 g + 2.801 g + 4.000 g ≈ 7.204 g. This confirms the composition.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n\n    We have an equimolar mixture of two salts containing N, H, and O. The overall mole ratio of atoms in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simpler integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n\n    Let's consider common salts containing these elements. Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) are excellent candidates as they are known to decompose upon heating to produce the observed gases.\n    *   Formula of Salt A: NH₄NO₃ (empirical formula N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   Formula of Salt B: NH₄NO₂ (empirical formula N₂H₄O₂)\n\n    If we combine one formula unit of each, the total atomic composition is:\n    *   N: 2 + 2 = 4\n    *   H: 4 + 4 = 8\n    *   O: 3 + 2 = 5\n    This gives the ratio N₄H₈O₅, which exactly matches our experimental finding. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n4.  **Confirm with Stoichiometry**\n\n    Let's verify that the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these salts produces the correct amount of products. Let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt in the mixture.\n    *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   From n moles of NH₄NO₂, we get n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n    *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrate: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n        *   From n moles of NH₄NO₃, we get n moles of N₂, n/2 moles of O₂, and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\n    *   Total moles of products:\n        *   N₂: n + n = 2n\n        *   O₂: n/2\n        *   H₂O: 2n + 2n = 4n\n\n    *   From our results, we know total moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol. So, 2n = 0.10 mol, which means n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Let's check this value with the other products:\n        *   Expected O₂ = n/2 = 0.05/2 = 0.025 mol. (Matches)\n        *   Expected H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (Matches)\n\n    *   Finally, let's check the total mass:\n        *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.002 g\n        *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g\n        *   Total mass = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g. (Matches)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes a sequence of reactions to identify the gaseous products from the decomposition. Let's analyze each step:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This is a key finding: the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, and the mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is entirely due to the oxygen atoms that have bonded with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This indicates that one of the gaseous products contained 0.05 moles of reactive oxygen atoms. A common decomposition product of nitrogen-based salts is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O). The reaction with hot copper would be: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. In this reaction, 0.05 moles of N₂O would provide the 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms to form CuO, and it would also produce 0.05 moles of N₂ gas.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas (C) is chemically inert to the reagents used, which strongly identifies it as nitrogen gas (N₂). This final 0.10 mol of N₂ consists of any N₂ produced directly in the decomposition plus the N₂ produced in Tube №3.\n    *   Total N₂ collected = N₂(from initial decomposition) + N₂(from N₂O reaction in Tube 3)\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂(initial) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, the initial decomposition must have directly produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n**2. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nFrom our analysis, the initial decomposition produced a gas mixture of:\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n\nWe are looking for two nitrogen-hydrogen-oxygen salts (A and B) that would yield these products. The decomposition reactions of ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate are a perfect match:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. If we assume the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃, the products would be:\n*   From NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From NH₄NO₃: 0.05 mol N₂O and 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   Total products: 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol H₂O.\n\nThis perfectly matches our findings from the experimental data. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This implies the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning identified the salts as Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3).\n# The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt combined.\n\n# Formula for Ammonium Nitrite is NH4NO2.\n# We can represent its elemental count as N2H4O2.\natoms_in_salt_A = 2 + 4 + 2 # (2 N, 4 H, 2 O)\n\n# Formula for Ammonium Nitrate is NH4NO3.\n# We can represent its elemental count as N2H4O3.\natoms_in_salt_B = 2 + 4 + 3 # (2 N, 4 H, 3 O)\n\n# The total number of atoms is the sum of atoms in one unit of A and one unit of B.\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_salt_A + atoms_in_salt_B\nprint(total_atoms)\n\n```\n\n17\n\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 17\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThe reasoning and calculations have been successfully validated by the code execution.\n\n1.  **Identify Products from Experimental Data:**\n    *   Tube 1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂): Absorbs H₂O. Mass gain = 3.60 g. Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂): No weight change implies no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) were formed.\n    *   Tube 3 (Hot Copper): Hot Cu reacts with an oxidizing gas, and CuO is formed. The weight gain of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen. Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol. The gas supplying the oxygen is likely a nitrogen oxide, as water has already been removed.\n    *   Remaining Gas (C): Volume = 2.24 L at STP. Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. This gas is inert to all previous reagents, suggesting it is N₂.\n\n2.  **Hypothesize Salts A and B:**\n    *   The products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxide of nitrogen) and the complete decomposition into gases strongly suggest ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n        *   A: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   B: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   The N₂O gas from salt B would then react with the hot copper in tube №3:\n        *   N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This reaction supplies the oxygen atoms detected.\n\n3.  **Verify the Hypothesis:**\n    *   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the moles of each salt.\n    *   From the decomposition reactions:\n        *   Total moles of H₂O = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = 4n.\n        *   From our data, moles of H₂O = 0.2 mol. So, 4n = 0.2 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Now, let's check the other products with n = 0.05 mol.\n        *   **Tube 3:** Salt B produces 'n' moles of N₂O. Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol. This provides 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. Mass of O = 0.05 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 0.80 g. This matches the experimental data.\n        *   **Gas C (N₂):** The final N₂ gas comes from two sources: the decomposition of salt A ('n' moles) and the reduction of N₂O ('n' moles). Total N₂ = n + n = 2n = 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This matches the experimental data for gas C.\n        *   **Initial Mass:** Let's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of each salt is 7.20 g.\n            *   Mass of NH₄NO₂ (Molar Mass ≈ 64 g/mol) = 0.05 mol × 64 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n            *   Mass of NH₄NO₃ (Molar Mass ≈ 80 g/mol) = 0.05 mol × 80 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n            *   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass.\n    *   The hypothesis is correct. Salts A and B are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂: 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃: 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe user wants me to solve a quantitative chemistry problem.\n\n**1.

Step-by-step Derivations**\n\n*   **Step 2a: Identify and quantify the products.**\n    *   **Tube 1:** The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of H₂O.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube 3:** The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen that reacted with Cu to form CuO.\n        *   The gas must be O₂. The mass increase is purely the mass of oxygen atoms.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since the gas is O₂, moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L at STP.\n        *   Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   **Tube 2:** The weight did not change. The gases entering it were the products from decomposition minus the water absorbed in Tube 1. The gas C that remains is inert to the whole system, and O₂ does not react with Ca(OH)₂. Therefore, gas C must be something inert like N₂, which is a common decomposition product. Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Verify product identification with the law of conservation of mass.**\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of N₂ produced = 0.1 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n    *   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the salt mixture perfectly. Our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) is correct.\n\n*   **Step 2c: Determine the total elemental composition of the initial mixture.**\n    *   Moles of Hydrogen (H) = 0.2 mol H₂O * 2 H/H₂O = 0.4 mol H.\n    *   Moles of Nitrogen (N) = 0.1 mol N₂ * 2 N/N₂ = 0.2 mol N.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen (O) = (0.2 mol H₂O * 1 O/H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ * 2 O/O₂) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n    *   The total moles of elements in the 7.20 g mixture are H: 0.4, N: 0.2, O: 0.25.\n    *   The ratio of atoms is H:N:O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25.

The logic is consistent and all provided data points have been used and accounted for. The identification of products from the experimental setup is standard chemical knowledge.

The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds directly to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ **0.2 mol H₂O**\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of this tube did not change, no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of the tube is due to the oxygen atoms bonding with the copper to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). Therefore, the mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol O\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of oxygen gas are:\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol O / 2 = **0.025 mol O₂**\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that remained after passing through all three tubes had a volume of 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.1 mol Gas C**\n    *   This remaining gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. The most likely candidate for a gas produced from nitrogen-containing salts is the inert nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n### **2. Verification with Mass Conservation**\n\nLet's check if the mass of the products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol × 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = 0.1 mol × 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Products** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture. This confirms our identification of the products and their quantities: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂.\n\n### **3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe gaseous products contain Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. This means the original salts must be composed of these elements. Since they are salts, they consist of a cation and an anion. Common ions formed from these elements are the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺) and the nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻) anions. This strongly suggests that the salts are ammonium-based.\n\nLet's consider the decomposition of **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n*   **Reaction 1:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Reaction 2:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. Let 'n' be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B.\n*   Moles of A = n\n*   Moles of B = n\n\nBased on the stoichiometry of the reactions above, we can express the moles of each product in terms of 'n':\n*   **Total N₂ produced:** n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = 2n\n*   **Total H₂O produced:** 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n\n*   **Total O₂ produced:** 0 (from NH₄NO₂) + n/2 (from NH₄NO₃) = n/2\n\nNow, we equate these with the moles calculated from the experimental results:\n*   Total N₂: 2n = 0.1 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Total H₂O: 4n = 0.2 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Total O₂: n/2 = 0.025 mol => **n = 0.05 mol**\n\nThe value of **n = 0.05 mol** is consistent for all three products, which strongly confirms that the salts are indeed Ammonium Nitrite and Ammonium Nitrate.\n\n### **4. Final Calculation: Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 8**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 9**\n\n*   **Total atoms in salts A and B combined:** 8 + 9 = **17**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Observations**\n\nThe problem describes the heating of an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃) and change the mass of the tube. Since the weight did not change, no significant amount of acidic gas like CO₂ was produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   Hot copper can also react with nitrogen oxides. For example, nitrous oxide (N₂O) reacts to form nitrogen gas and copper oxide (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO). This possibility must be considered.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas did not react with the drying agent, limewater, or hot copper. The most common inert gas in such decompositions is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify the Products of Decomposition**\n\nBased on the analysis, the gaseous products from heating salts A and B are:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\n**3. Determine the Composition and Moles of the Initial Salts**\n\nThe products contain nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, which must have come from the initial salts. This points towards ammonium salts of oxyacids of nitrogen. Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe decomposition reactions for these salts are:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate:** The decomposition is temperature-dependent. At around 200°C, the main reaction produces nitrous oxide: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g). However, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, a different reaction can occur: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\nLet's assume the mixture is equimolar, with `n` moles of each salt. Let's calculate `n` from the total mass.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol\n*   Total mass = `n * (64.04) + n * (80.04) = 7.20` g\n*   `n * (144.08) = 7.20`\n*   `n = 7.20 / 144.08 ≈ 0.05` mol\n\nSo, we have **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂** and **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃**. Now let's see if their decomposition products match the experimental results.\n\n*   **Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   Using NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Products: **0.05 mol N₂** and **0.10 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Let's test the reaction: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O.\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃, the moles of products are:\n        *   N₂: (0.05 mol NH₄NO₃) * (2 mol N₂ / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = **0.05 mol N₂**\n        *   O₂: (0.05 mol NH₄NO₃) * (1 mol O₂ / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = **0.025 mol O₂**\n        *   H₂O: (0.05 mol NH₄NO₃) * (4 mol H₂O / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = **0.10 mol H₂O**\n\n*   **Total products from the mixture:**\n    *   Total Moles H₂O = 0.10 (from nitrite) + 0.10 (from nitrate) = **0.20 mol**. (Matches experiment)\n    *   Total Moles O₂ = 0 (from nitrite) + 0.025 (from nitrate) = **0.025 mol**. (Matches experiment)\n    *   Total Moles N₂ = 0.05 (from nitrite) + 0.05 (from nitrate) = **0.10 mol**. (Matches experiment)\n\nThe hypothesis that the mixture consists of 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate, with the given decomposition pathways, perfectly matches all the experimental data.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and one formula unit of salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Total atoms in both salts:**\n    *   Total = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
