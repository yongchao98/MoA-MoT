The target ion [PO₄³⁻] is determined by the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, so Ka₃ is used in the final step.\n*   **Buffer Assumption:** The calculation assumes that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations. This is a valid assumption because the Ka values are small, and the common ion effect in the buffer minimizes dissociation.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.

H₂PO₄⁻ is a weak acid.\n*   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: A hydrated salt that completely dissociates in water to provide sodium ions (Na⁺) and hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻). HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base of H₂PO₄⁻.\nThe combination of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻) forms a buffer solution.\nThe question asks for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n*   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L.\n\n*   **For KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Molar mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n    *   Since KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻, moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Initial concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = moles / V = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n\n*   **For Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:**\n    *   Molar mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n    *   Since Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ + 2H₂O, moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 0.005618 mol.\n    *   Initial concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = moles / V = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer solution.**\nThe pH and [H⁺] of this buffer are determined by the equilibrium between the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻.

Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻].**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This corresponds to the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid.\n\n*   Equilibrium reaction: HPO₄²⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + PO₄³⁻(aq)\n*   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹².\n*   The expression for Ka₃ is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can now solve for [PO₄³⁻] using the [H⁺] we just calculated and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻].

Ka₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] of the solution.\n3.  **Final Calculation:** The final calculation for the target ion, [PO₄³⁻], depends on its parent species (HPO₄²⁻) and its corresponding equilibrium constant (Ka₃).\n4.  **Approximations:** It is valid to assume that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations when calculating [H⁺], because the acid/base is weak. Similarly, it's valid to use the calculated [H⁺] and initial [HPO₄²⁻] to find [PO₄³⁻] because Ka₃ is extremely small.\n5.  **Volume Unit:** Ensure volume is converted from cm³ to L (1 cm³ = 1 mL = 0.001 L).\n\nFinal calculation: [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸) = 6.235... x 10⁻⁷ M.

The target ion [PO₄³⁻] is determined by the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, so Ka₃ is used in the final step.\n*   **Buffer Assumption:** The calculation assumes that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations. This is a valid assumption because the Ka values are small, and the common ion effect in the buffer minimizes dissociation.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.

We can assume that the equilibrium concentrations of [HPO₄²⁻] and [H⁺] are approximately equal to the values determined from the buffer system because Ka₃ is very small, meaning very little HPO₄²⁻ will dissociate further.\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.34636)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.23 x 10⁻¹³ M / (10⁻¹) * 10\nWait, calculation error here.

Calculate the Moles of the Acid and Conjugate Base\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of the weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻) from the given masses.\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄ (H₂PO₄⁻):**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (HPO₄²⁻):**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n### 3. Calculate the Concentrations of the Acid and Conjugate Base\n\nNext, we find the initial concentrations of these ions in the 200.00 cm³ (0.20000 L) solution.\n\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume (L)\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume (L)\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n### 4. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]\n\nThe pH (and thus the [H⁺]) of the buffer is primarily controlled by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ pair.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Constant:** Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n\nWe can rearrange the acid dissociation constant expression to solve for [H⁺]:\n*   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n### 5. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]\n\nThe concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Constant:** Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n\nWe rearrange the expression for Ka₃ to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n*   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   **[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])**\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n*   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.23 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis result is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
