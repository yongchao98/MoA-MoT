    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we must calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. This total energy is the sum of two components:\n1.  The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  The potential energy from the mutual interaction of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nThe system consists of 13 identical particles.\n*   Charge of each particle, `q = 2e`. The elementary charge `e` is exactly `1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹` Coulombs.\n*   The 13th charge is fixed at a point P.\n*   12 charges are constrained to a distance `R = 2 m` from P.\n*   Coulomb's constant, `k_e`, is approximately `8.988 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²`.\n\n**1. Interaction Energy between Central Charge and Shell Charges (`U_cs`)**\n\nThe potential energy between the central charge `q` and one of the charges on the sphere is `k_e * q² / R`. Since there are 12 such charges, this part of the energy is:\n`U_cs = 12 * k_e * q² / R`\n\n**2. Interaction Energy between the 12 Shell Charges (`U_ss`)**\n\nTo find the minimum energy of the system, the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual potential energy. This is a well-known problem in physics called the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the configuration of minimum energy is at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of this configuration is given by:\n`U_ss = C₁₂ * k_e * q² / R`\nwhere `C₁₂` is a dimensionless constant specific to the icosahedral arrangement. The value of this constant has been numerically calculated to be approximately `49.165335`.\n\n**Calculation of Total Minimum Energy (`U_total`)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of these two energy components:\n`U_total = U_cs + U_ss = (12 * k_e * q² / R) + (C₁₂ * k_e * q² / R)`\n`U_total = (12 + C₁₂) * k_e * q² / R`\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n*   `q = 2 * 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C = 3.204353268 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   `q² ≈ 1.0267876 × 10⁻³⁷ C²`\n*   `k_e ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n*   `C₁₂ ≈ 49.165335`\n\n`U_total = (12 + 49.165335) * (8.98755 × 10⁹ * 1.0267876 × 10⁻³⁷) / 2`\n`U_total = 61.165335 * (9.2285 × 10⁻²⁸) / 2`\n`U_total = 61.165335 * 4.61425 × 10⁻²⁸ J`\n`U_total ≈ 2.82239 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nRounding the result to three decimal places gives `2.822 × 10⁻²⁶ J`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 122.330\nB) 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶\nC) 5.645 x 10⁻²⁶\nD) 7.056 x 10⁻²⁷\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
