    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Energy of the States\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\nThe different energy states are determined by the value of *n*:\n*   **Ground State (n=0):** This is the lowest energy level.\n    $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State (n=1):**\n    $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State (n=2):**\n    $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State (n=3):**\n    $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is **(9/2)ħω**.\n\n### Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (eigenfunctions) that have that same energy. For the n-th energy level, the degeneracy, $g_n$, can be calculated using the formula:\n$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$.\n\nFor the third excited state, n=3. Plugging this value into the formula:\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$.\n\nSo, there are **10** linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state. This corresponds to the 10 possible combinations of the non-negative integer quantum numbers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$) that sum to 3:\n*   (3, 0, 0) - 3 permutations\n*   (2, 1, 0) - 6 permutations\n*   (1, 1, 1) - 1 permutation\n\nTotal combinations = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nBased on the calculations, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω, and its degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<B>>>"
