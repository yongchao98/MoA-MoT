    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and chromatographic separations:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the original chiral center at C5 is unaffected, the reduction of the C3 ketone results in the formation of two products that differ in the stereochemistry at the new C3 center. These products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetrical molecule with two ketone groups. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the two ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new chiral centers, resulting in the formation of pentane-2,4-diol. Three possible stereoisomers can be formed:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S) or (2S, 4R), which are identical)\n*   **Relationship:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). The meso compound is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry and is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the product mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. In an achiral environment like a normal-phase column:\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties and therefore co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated into distinct peaks.\n\nApplying this to the mixture:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will be separated, yielding **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will not be separated and will elute together as **one peak**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, thus eluting as a separate, **second peak** from the Reaction II products.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different molecules and will not co-elute.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of the peaks from each group: 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\nA chiral stationary phase provides a chiral environment that allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers. The chiral column interacts differently with each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture.\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5, separated as it is a diastereomer to the others)\n\nEach of these five compounds will have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase, resulting in **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows there will be 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
