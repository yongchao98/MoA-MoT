    "To determine the net potential energy of the system, we employ the method of images. A point charge *q* at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R* induces charges on the sphere's surface. The electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" *q'* located at a distance *b* from the center, along the line connecting the center to the charge *q*.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For the potential on the surface of the sphere to be zero (as it is grounded), the image charge *q'* and its position *b* are given by:\n    *   *q'* = -*q*(*R*/*d*)\n    *   *b* = *R*²/*d*\n    The image charge is located inside the sphere.\n\n2.  **Force on the Charge**: The force exerted by the grounded sphere on the point charge *q* is identical to the force exerted by the image charge *q'*. The distance between the real charge *q* (at *d*) and the image charge *q'* (at *b*) is *d* - *b*.\n    *   Distance = *d* - *R*²/*d* = (*d*² - *R*²)/ *d*\n\n    The force *F* is:\n    *   *F* = *k* *q* *q'* / (distance)²\n    *   *F* = *k* *q* (-*qR*/*d*) / ( (*d*² - *R*²)/ *d* )²\n    *   *F* = -*k* *q*² *R* *d* / (*d*² - *R*²)²\n    The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive, pulling the charge *q* towards the sphere.\n\n3.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The potential energy (*U*) of the system is equal to the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to the distance *d* from the center of the sphere. The potential energy is the negative of the work done by the electric field as the charge moves from infinity to *d*.\n\n    *   *U*(*d*) = - ∫[∞ to *d*] *F*(*x*) *dx*\n\n    Where *F*(*x*) is the force on the charge at a distance *x* from the center:\n    *   *F*(*x*) = -*k* *q*² *R* *x* / (*x*² - *R*²)²\n\n    Substituting the force into the integral for potential energy:\n    *   *U*(*d*) = - ∫[∞ to *d*] (-*k* *q*² *R* *x* / (*x*² - *R*²)²) *dx*\n    *   *U*(*d*) = *k* *q*² *R* ∫[∞ to *d*] *x* / (*x*² - *R*²)² *dx*\n\n    To solve the integral, we use the substitution *u* = *x*² - *R*², which gives *du* = 2*x* *dx*.\n    *   ∫ *x* / (*x*² - *R*²)² *dx* = ½ ∫ *u*⁻² *du* = -½ *u*⁻¹ = -1 / (2(*x*² - *R*²))\n\n    Now, evaluating the definite integral:\n    *   *U*(*d*) = *k* *q*² *R* [ -1 / (2(*x*² - *R*²)) ] from ∞ to *d*\n    *   *U*(*d*) = *k* *q*² *R* [ (-1 / (2(*d*² - *R*²))) - (-1 / (2(∞² - *R*²))) ]\n    *   *U*(*d*) = *k* *q*² *R* [ -1 / (2(*d*² - *R*²)) - 0 ]\n    *   *U*(*d*) = - (1/2) * *k* *q*² *R* / (*d*² - *R*²)\n\n    An alternative method is to consider that the potential energy is half of the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. The potential at the location of charge *q* due to the image charge *q'* is *V'*.\n    *   *V'* = *k* *q'* / (distance) = *k*(-*qR*/*d*) / ((*d*² - *R*²)/ *d*) = -*k* *q* *R* / (*d*² - *R*²)\n    *   The potential energy *U* = ½ *q* *V'*\n    *   *U* = ½ *q* [ -*k* *q* *R* / (*d*² - *R*²) ] = - (1/2) * *k* *q*² *R* / (*d*² - *R*²)\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
