    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (usually with an acid or base catalyst, which is implicit) to form 2-bromocyclohexanone. This is Product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with a strong base such as sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate which then rearranges to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid. In this case, 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. This is Product 2.\n\nAn alternative reaction, aldol condensation, can occur when cyclohexanone (not 2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with NaOH. However, the starting material for this step is 2-bromocyclohexanone, making the Favorskii rearrangement the key reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2) reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) in a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. Pyridine is typically used as a solvent and to neutralize the HCl produced. The resulting compound, Product 3, is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reduction at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde. This is the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine its structure for symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (C₅H₉-CHO) consists of a cyclopentane ring bonded to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring. Due to this symmetry and the different positions relative to the aldehyde group, the hydrogen atoms have distinct chemical environments, which would result in different signals in an NMR spectrum. Let's count these unique environments:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO)**: This proton is unique. (1 hydrogen)\n2.  **The proton on C1**: The proton on the carbon atom of the ring directly attached to the aldehyde group is in a unique environment. (1 hydrogen)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5**: These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (they are not equivalent to each other). The two \"upper\" protons are equivalent to each other, and the two \"lower\" protons are equivalent to each other. This gives two distinct sets of protons. (2 + 2 = 4 hydrogens, in 2 sets)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4**: Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The two protons on each are diastereotopic. This also gives two distinct sets of protons. (2 + 2 = 4 hydrogens, in 2 sets)\n\nIn total, we have 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = 6 chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
