    "### Analysis of Neutrino Fluxes\n\nThe hypothetical scenario involves the immediate cessation of the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain. All other nuclear reactions, including the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycles, continue as normal. We need to find the ratio of the neutrino flux in the 700-800 keV energy band to the flux in the 800-900 keV energy band.\n\n**1. Identifying Neutrino Sources in the Energy Bands:**\n\nFirst, let's identify which solar neutrino sources contribute to the specified energy bands under normal conditions by examining the solar neutrino spectrum.\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   **⁸B neutrinos:** The pp-III branch produces Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV. This spectrum significantly contributes to the 700-800 keV range.\n    *   **CNO neutrinos:** Neutrinos from the CNO cycle, particularly from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays, also have continuous spectra that contribute to this energy range.\n\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   **⁷Be neutrinos:** The pp-II branch produces monochromatic (single-energy) neutrinos from Beryllium-7 (⁷Be) electron capture. The primary line is at 0.862 MeV (861 keV), placing it squarely within this band.\n    *   **⁸B neutrinos:** The continuous spectrum from ⁸B decay also contributes flux in this higher energy band.\n    *   **CNO neutrinos:** The CNO cycle neutrinos also contribute a continuous flux in this band.\n\n**2. Effect of Stopping the pp-III Branch:**\n\nThe premise is that the pp-III branch has stopped. The key reaction in the pp-III branch is the decay of ⁸B. Therefore, stopping this branch means the flux of ⁸B neutrinos drops to zero across jejich entire energy spectrum. The fluxes from the pp-II branch (specifically the ⁷Be neutrinos) and the CNO cycle remain unchanged.\n\n**3. Re-evaluating the Fluxes in Each Band:**\n\nNow we assess the remaining neutrino sources in each band after the pp-III branch ceases.\n\n*   **New Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   The dominant contributor, the ⁸B neutrinos, is now gone.\n    *   The only remaining source is the continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle neutrinos. The flux from the CNO cycle is known to be significantly lower than the flux from the main pp-chain branches, especially compared to the ⁸B flux at these energies.\n\n*   **New Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The contribution from ⁸B neutrinos is gone.\n    *   However, the very strong, monochromatic line from ⁷Be neutrinos at 861 keV remains. The ⁷Be neutrino flux is one of the most significant components of the solar neutrino spectrum.\n    *   The small continuous background from CNO neutrinos also remains.\n\n**4. Comparing the Fluxes and Determining the Ratio:**\n\nLet's compare the remaining sources in the two bands.\n\n*   The flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV) is now composed only of the relatively low-intensity tail of the CNO neutrino spectrum.\n*   The flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV) is dominated by the massive peak of the 861 keV ⁷Be neutrino line.\n\nThe flux from the ⁷Be line is vastly greater than the flux from the CNO cycle in an adjacent narrow energy band. Visual inspection of any standard solar neutrino spectrum chart confirms that the peak of the ⁷Be line is orders of magnitude higher than the continuous CNO spectrum in that energy region.\n\nTherefore, after the cessation of the pp-III branch:\n*   Flux (Band 1) = CNO flux in the 700-800 keV range (very small).\n*   Flux (Band 2) = ⁷Be flux at 861 keV + CNO flux in the 800-900 keV range (dominated by the large ⁷Be flux).\n\nThe flux in Band 1 will be significantly smaller than the flux in Band 2. This means the ratio Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) will be much less than 1. Given the options, 0.01 (10⁻²) is the most plausible value representing a large disparity where the denominator is significantly larger than the numerator.\n\nFinal check: Without the ⁸B neutrinos, the 700-800 keV band becomes nearly empty, save for a minor CNO contribution. In contrast, the 800-900 keV band retains the massive ⁷Be line, which is a dominant feature of the entire solar neutrino spectrum. The ratio must be very small.\n\n<<<C>>>"
