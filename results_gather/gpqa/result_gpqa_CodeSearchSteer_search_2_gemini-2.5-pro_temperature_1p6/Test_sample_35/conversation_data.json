    "To identify the phenomenon associated with the observed absorption line, we must first determine its original, un-redshifted energy. The distant object is 2.1 gigaparsecs away, which means the light from it has been stretched to longer wavelengths (lower energies) by the expansion of the universe.\n\nFirst, the cosmological redshift (z) is calculated based on the distance. Using a standard Hubble constant (H₀) of approximately 70 km/s/Mpc, the recession velocity and resulting redshift are determined. The rest-frame energy (E_rest) is then found using the formula E_rest = E_observed * (1 + z).\n\nThe observed energy is 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV). The distance of 2.1 Gpc corresponds to a redshift (z) of approximately 0.49.\n\n*   **Rest-frame energy calculation**: E_rest ≈ 3.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV * (1 + 0.49) ≈ 5.8 x 10⁻⁶ eV.\n\nNext, this rest-frame energy needs to be matched to a known atomic or molecular transition in the interstellar medium. The energy value of ~5.8 µeV is famously associated with the hyperfine transition of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI). This transition emits or absorbs radiation with a wavelength of 21 cm, which corresponds to a frequency of about 1420 MHz.\n\nThis identification immediately points towards atomic hydrogen, ruling out the warm and cold molecular interstellar medium (options C and D). We are left to distinguish between the warm and cold phases of the atomic medium.\n\n*   **Warm Atomic Interstellar Medium (WNM):** This phase consists of neutral hydrogen at temperatures around 10,000 K. It is widespread and is typically observed through its broad emission lines.\n*   **Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium (CNM):** This phase is much cooler, with temperatures around 100 K, and is denser than the WNM. Due to its lower temperature, it produces narrow absorption lines when it lies between a background radio source (like the distant object in the problem) and the observer. The detection of a distinct absorption line, as stated in the problem, is a strong indicator of the cold neutral medium.\n\nTherefore, the observed absorption line is most likely caused by the 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen within the cold atomic interstellar medium of the Milky Way.\n\n<<<A>>>"
