    "This problem is a classic example of special relativity, specifically time dilation. To determine the time elapsed for the astronaut, we must first calculate the journey's duration from a stationary observer's perspective (i.e., on Earth) and then use the time dilation formula to find the time experienced by the traveling astronaut.\n\n### 1. Distance and Time in Earth's Reference Frame\n\nFirst, we need the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The LMC is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years. Other estimates range from 160,000 to 179,000 light-years. For this calculation, we will use a distance (D) of 160,000 light-years as a conservative and commonly cited figure.\n\nThe spacecraft travels at a speed (v) of 0.99999987 *c*. From Earth's perspective, the time (Δt) it takes to travel this distance is:\n\nΔt = Distance / Speed = 160,000 light-years / 0.99999987 *c*\n\nSince a light-year is the distance light travels in one year, this simplifies to:\n\nΔt ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 years ≈ 160,000.02 years.\n\nSo, for an observer on Earth, the journey takes just over 160,000 years.\n\n### 2. Time Dilation and the Astronaut's Perspective\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for a moving observer passes slower than for a stationary observer. This effect, known as time dilation, is described by the formula:\n\nΔt' = Δt / γ\n\nWhere:\n*   Δt' is the proper time, or the time experienced by the astronaut.\n*   Δt is the time measured by the stationary observer on Earth.\n*   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) for the given speed:\n\nv/c = 0.99999987\n\n1.  (v/c)² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n2.  1 - (v/c)² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026\n3.  √(1 - (v/c)²) = √0.00000026 ≈ 0.0005099\n4.  γ = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1961.16\n\nNow, we can find the time experienced by the astronaut (Δt'):\n\nΔt' = 160,000.02 years / 1961.16 ≈ 81.58 years.\n\nThis result, approximately 81.6 years, is very close to 81 years. The astronaut is 22 years old and has an average lifespan of 150 years, meaning they have 128 years of life remaining. Since the journey takes about 81-82 years from their perspective, they would be approximately 22 + 82 = 104 years old upon arrival, well within their lifespan. Therefore, the astronaut would survive the journey.\n\nGiven the available options, 81 years is the most accurate answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
