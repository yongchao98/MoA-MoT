    "To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we must analyze the relationship between the observed wavelength shift and the planet's orbital period. This is done using the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method for exoplanet detection.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The periodic shift in a star's spectral lines (Δλ) is caused by the Doppler effect as the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The magnitude of this wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (the component of its velocity along our line of sight). The maximum velocity observed is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, or `K`.\n\n2.  **Calculating the Ratio of Stellar Velocities:** The problem states that the wavelength shift for the host of planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for the host of planet #2, it is 7 milliangstroms. Since the velocity `K` is proportional to the shift Δλ, the ratio of the stars' maximum velocities is:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4`\n\n3.  **The Radial Velocity Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass (`m_p`), the star's mass (`M_star`), and the orbital period (`T`) by the following relationship:\n    `K ∝ m_p / (M_star^(2/3) * T^(1/3))`\n\n4.  **Applying the Formula to the Problem:** We are given that the masses of the two stars are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the masses of the two planets are also similar (`m_p1 = m_p2`). Therefore, the terms `m_p` and `M_star` are constant for both systems. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)`\n    This means the radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n5.  **Finding the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = (T₂)^(-1/3) / (T₁)^(-1/3) = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Solving for the Period Ratio:** By substituting the velocity ratio calculated in step 2, we get:\n    `1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n    To solve for the ratio of the periods, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    `(1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂`\n    `2.744 = T₁ / T₂`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which corresponds to the ratio `T₂ / T₁`. To find this, we take the reciprocal of the value we just calculated:\n    `T₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644`\n\nBased on this calculation, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
