    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (S), which we can consider the stationary frame.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (S'), which is the moving frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v` = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), `Δt'` = 50 s. This is the proper time, often denoted as `Δt₀`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c` ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (`d`).\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The problem involves time dilation. According to the theory of special relativity, time in a moving reference frame passes more slowly relative to a stationary observer.\n    *   The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt₀`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n    *   Time Dilation Formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Lorentz Factor Formula: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance:**\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame is the velocity of the ejecta (in that frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (in that same frame).\n    *   Formula: `d = v * Δt`\n    *   Substituting the time dilation formula: `d = v * (γ * Δt₀)` which is `d = v * Δt₀ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate `(v/c)²`:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate the term under the square root:\n        `1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96`\n    *   Calculate the square root:\n        `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n    *   Now, plug all the values into the distance formula:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,859 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,859 km.\n    *   Looking at the choices:\n        A) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if relativistic effects were ignored).\n        B) 2,880,000 km.\n        C) 3,060,000 km.\n        D) 2,940,000 km (This would be the result of incorrectly applying length contraction).\n\n    *   Our calculated value of 3,061,859 km is closest to option C.\n\nAnother way to reason this is to note that due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) will be *longer* than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the distance covered (`d = v * Δt`) must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance (`v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50s = 3,000,000 km`). Only option C is greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\n<<<C>>>"
