    "### Analysis of the Physics Problem\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):** The spin-1/2 particle has its magnetic moment `μ` aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction (`B_z = B * z_hat`). The magnetic moment is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γ * S`. The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ * S_z * B`. Since the moment is aligned with the field, the spin is in an eigenstate of the `S_z` operator. To be aligned (lowest energy state), the particle must be in the \"spin up\" state with respect to the z-axis, denoted as `|+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change (t = 0):** The magnetic field is instantly switched to the +Y direction (`B_y = B * y_hat`). The Hamiltonian for `t > 0` becomes `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ * S_y * B`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (t > 0):** The state of the particle, which was `|+z⟩` at t=0, now evolves according to the new Hamiltonian. This evolution is described by the Schrödinger equation. The expectation value of any observable, such as the z-component of the spin, will now be time-dependent.\n\n4.  **Larmor Precession:** The behavior of a magnetic moment in an external magnetic field is described by Larmor precession. The magnetic moment vector `μ` (and thus the spin vector `S`) precesses around the direction of the magnetic field `B`. The angular frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, given by the formula `ω = γ * B`.\n\n5.  **Applying Larmor Precession to the Problem:**\n    *   At `t = 0`, the spin is pointing in the +Z direction.\n    *   For `t > 0`, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Y direction.\n    *   Therefore, the spin vector will start to precess around the Y-axis.\n    *   As the spin vector `S` rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis, its Z-component will oscillate.\n    *   The frequency of this precession, and therefore the frequency of the oscillation of the Z-component, is the Larmor frequency `ω = γ * B`.\n\n6.  **Quantum Mechanical Calculation:**\n    *   The initial state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n    *   The Hamiltonian for `t>0` is `H = -γBS_y`.\n    *   The time evolution of the state is `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩ = exp(iγBS_yt/ħ)|+z⟩`.\n    *   We want to find the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   Calculation shows that `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   Therefore, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The oscillation of this value is governed by `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nBoth the classical analogy of Larmor precession and a full quantum mechanical calculation yield the same oscillation frequency.\n\nFinal Answer is B because the oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, ω = γB.\n\n<<<B>>>"
