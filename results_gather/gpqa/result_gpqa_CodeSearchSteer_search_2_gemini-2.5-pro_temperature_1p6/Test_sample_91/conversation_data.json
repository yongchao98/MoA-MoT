    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, the following steps are taken:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\nThe molecular formula is parsed from the condensed structural formula:\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: 3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens\n*   `=CH-`: 1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: 2 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens\n*   `-CH=`: 1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: 3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens\n\nSumming these up gives a molecular formula of **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Covalent Bonds**\nFrom the structure, we can count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each singly bonded to a carbon atom, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure contains two double bonds (`C=C`), one at the beginning `(CH3)2C=CH-` and one near the end `-CH=C(CH3)2`. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** The total number of single bonds between carbon atoms is 9.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe energy required to break the reactants into gaseous atoms is the sum of the enthalpies of atomization.\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2 (breaking H-H bonds): 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total energy for reactant atomization**: 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\nThis is the energy released when one mole of the gaseous molecule is formed from its constituent gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Total bond energy of the product**: 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = 11200 kJ\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the energy required to atomize the reactants minus the energy released when forming the product bonds.\n*   ΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**6. Convert to kJ/g and Compare with Options**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Some of the options are in kJ/g, so a conversion is necessary.\n*   The molar mass of C12H22 is approximately 166.30 g/mol. Using integer masses for simplicity (C=12, H=1), the molar mass is 166 g/mol.\n*   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.44 kJ/g.\n\nThis calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
