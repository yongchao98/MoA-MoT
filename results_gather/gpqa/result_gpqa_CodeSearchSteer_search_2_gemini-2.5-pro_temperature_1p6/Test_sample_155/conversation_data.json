    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → Product 1**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The first step is the reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with m-CPBA. This reaction is a syn-addition, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond. For a trans-alkene, this results in a trans-epoxide. Since the attack can happen from either face of the alkene with equal probability, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The second step is the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the epoxide. This is an S<sub>N</sub>2-like ring-opening that occurs with anti-addition; the incoming water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide's oxygen atom. When the racemic mixture of trans-epoxides undergoes this anti-addition of water, the result is a single, achiral meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This overall transformation is known as anti-dihydroxylation.\n\n**Product of Reaction 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol.**\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → Product 2**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) reacts with m-CPBA in a syn-addition. This stereospecific reaction preserves the cis-stereochemistry, forming a single meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of this meso-epoxide proceeds via anti-addition of water. Attack at the two different carbons of the epoxide ring leads to the formation of two different enantiomers. The result is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Products of Reaction 2: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.**\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions, resulting in a mixture containing three stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n*   meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Enantiomers will therefore have the same retention time and elute together as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   In the mixture, the racemic pair of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol will co-elute as one peak. The meso-(4R,5S)-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will have a different retention time and appear as a separate peak.\n*   Therefore, the chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   Chiral HPLC utilizes a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n*   In this environment, enantiomers can be separated because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n*   The three stereoisomers in the mixture—the meso compound and the two enantiomers—will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   The (4R,5R) enantiomer, the (4S,5S) enantiomer, and the meso-(4R,5S) compound will each have a unique retention time and will be resolved.\n*   Therefore, the chemist will observe **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis leads to the observation of 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
