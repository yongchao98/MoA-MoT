    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary physics. The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from its host star, and this distance is related to its orbital period by Kepler's Third Law.\n\nFirst, Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), which for a circular orbit is the orbital radius (r). This can be written as P² ∝ r³. From this relationship, the orbital radius can be expressed in terms of the orbital period: r ∝ P^(2/3).\n\nNext, the equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance (r) from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature also includes the star's temperature and the planet's albedo, but since these are the same for both planets in this system, they cancel out when we take a ratio. Therefore, we have the relationship T ∝ 1/√r or T ∝ r^(-1/2).\n\nBy combining these two proportionalities, we can establish a direct relationship between the equilibrium temperature and the orbital period:\nT ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3)\n\nThis means that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse cube root of the orbital period.\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_1 to Planet_5 as 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n*   The orbital period of Planet_2 (P₂) is 2 in this ratio.\n*   The orbital period of Planet_4 (P₄) is 3.5 in this ratio.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (T₄/T₂), we can use the derived relationship:\n\nT₄ / T₂ = (P₄ / P₂)^(-1/3) = (3.5 / 2)^(-1/3) = (1.75)^(-1/3)\n\nCalculating this value:\n\nT₄ / T₂ ≈ 1 / (1.75)^(1/3) ≈ 1 / 1.205 ≈ 0.83\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
