    "Here is a detailed analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\nThis compound is a substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism can arise in such molecules due to a phenomenon called atropisomerism. This occurs when rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is sterically hindered by bulky groups in the ortho positions (the positions adjacent to the connecting bond). In this molecule, the nitro groups (-NO2) and the dimethyl dicarboxylate groups (-COOCH3) are in the 6, 6', 2, and 2' positions, which are all ortho positions. These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar, leading to a chiral, non-superimposable mirror image. This type of chirality, resulting from hindered rotation about an axis, is known as axial chirality. Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is optically active.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nAlso known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a central carbon atom (C2) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is called a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active and exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers ((R)- and (S)-forms). Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\nThe chemical structure of benzophenone consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group, bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and therefore optically inactive. While highly substituted benzophenones can be chiral, the parent benzophenone molecule is not.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\nThis molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion, which is a point of symmetry. Any molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
