    "### Analysis of the Problem\n\nTo determine the relative speed and total energy of the system of two astronauts, we must apply the principles of special relativity.\n\n**1. Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince both astronauts are traveling in the same direction at relativistic speeds, we cannot simply subtract their velocities. We must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, which is a form of the velocity addition formula. Let v₁ be the velocity of the first astronaut (0.6c) and v₂ be the velocity of the second astronaut (0.5c). The formula for the relative velocity of astronaut 1 with respect to astronaut 2 is:\n\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n**v_rel ≈ 0.14c**\n\n**2. Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts. The total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the equation E = γmc², where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n*   **For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₁):\n        γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)² / c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n    *   Next, calculate the energy (E₁):\n        E₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n*   **For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₂):\n        γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)² / c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547\n    *   Next, calculate the energy (E₂):\n        E₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\n*   **Total System Energy (E_total):**\n\n    *   The total energy is the sum of the individual energies:\n        E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\n        **E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the calculations:\n*   The relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n*   The total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
