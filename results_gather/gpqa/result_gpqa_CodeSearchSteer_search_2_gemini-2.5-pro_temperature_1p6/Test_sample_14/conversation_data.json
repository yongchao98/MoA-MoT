    "To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting its host star, we can use the geometric transit probability formula. For a planet in a circular orbit, this probability is approximated by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's semi-major axis. The researchers have chosen to observe the planet with the higher transit probability.\n\n### Analysis of Transit Probability\n\nThe probability (`p`) of a planet transiting its star is given by:\n\n*   `p ≈ R_star / a`\n\nwhere `R_star` is the radius of the host star and `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find which planet is the better candidate, we need to calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, `p₁ / p₂`.\n\n`p₁ / p₂ = (R_star₁ / a₁) / (R_star₂ / a₂) = (R_star₁ / R_star₂) * (a₂ / a₁)`\n\nFrom the information provided:\n*   The host stars have the same radii: `R_star₁ = R_star₂`. This simplifies the ratio `R_star₁ / R_star₂` to 1.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of probabilities is determined by the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes: `p₁ / p₂ = a₂ / a₁`.\n\n### Applying Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion describes the relationship between the orbital period (`P`), the semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of the host star (`M_star`). The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis and inversely proportional to the stellar mass.\n\nThe mathematical relationship is:\n\n*   `P² ∝ a³ / M_star`\n\nThis can be rearranged to solve for the semi-major axis:\n\n*   `a ∝ (P² * M_star)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (`a₂ / a₁`):\n\n*   `a₂ / a₁ = [(P₂² * M_star₂) / (P₁² * M_star₁)]^(1/3)`\n\n### Substituting the Given Values\n\nThe problem states:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P₁ = P₂ / 3`, or `P₂ = 3 * P₁`.\n*   The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass twice that of the host star of Planet_2: `M_star₁ = 2 * M_star₂`.\n\nLet's substitute these relationships into the equation for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\n`a₂ / a₁ = [((3P₁)² * M_star₂) / (P₁² * (2M_star₂))]^(1/3)`\n`a₂ / a₁ = [(9 * P₁² * M_star₂) / (2 * P₁² * M_star₂)]^(1/3)`\n\nThe `P₁²` and `M_star₂` terms cancel out, leaving:\n\n`a₂ / a₁ = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5:\n\n`a₂ / a₁ ≈ 1.65096`\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nSince the ratio of the transit probabilities `p₁ / p₂` is equal to `a₂ / a₁`, we have:\n\n`p₁ / p₂ ≈ 1.65`\n\nThis means the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\n\n**A) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**\n\n<<<A>>>"
