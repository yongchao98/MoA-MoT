    "Here is a breakdown of the immunological processes to determine the correct answer:\n\n*   **The Scenario:** You have introduced a viral protein (antigen) into a mouse via the oral route. This antigen has successfully traveled to the Peyer's patches, which are key secondary lymphoid organs in the gut responsible for initiating mucosal immune responses. In the Peyer's patches, you observe a population of proliferating cells. When you sequence the variable heavy chain gene from these cells, you find a high degree of variability (mutations).\n\n*   **Analysis of Options:**\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the constant region (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG) of the heavy chain gene. This alters the antibody's function but does *not* affect the variable region, which determines antigen binding. Therefore, it does not account for the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene.\n    *   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the initial gene rearrangement process that occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) during B-cell development, *before* the B-cell encounters an antigen. It creates the initial diversity of the B-cell receptor repertoire. The scenario describes a process happening in proliferating cells within a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen stimulation, not the initial creation of the receptor.\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B-cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Following antigen stimulation, this mechanism intentionally introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates a pool of B-cells with slightly different receptors. Those with mutations that improve binding affinity for the antigen are selected to proliferate further (a process called affinity maturation). The \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating cell population in a Peyer's patch is the classic sign of somatic hypermutation.\n    *   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system. It involves a cascade of plasma proteins that helps to eliminate pathogens, but it has no role in altering the genes of lymphocytes.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B-cells in the Peyer's patches, following antigen exposure, is the direct result of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
