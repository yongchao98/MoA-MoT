    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the required Lorentz factor.\n\n### Understanding the Physics\n\nThe problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are:\n1.  **Exponential Decay:** The number of unstable particles, `N(t)`, remaining after a time `t` is given by the formula `N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/T)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `T` is the mean lifetime of the particles in the frame where the time `t` is measured (the lab frame).\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle appears longer in the lab frame (`T`) compared to its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, `τ₀`). This relationship is described by the Lorentz factor, `γ`, where `T = γ * τ₀`.\n\n### Setting up the Equations\n\nCombining these two concepts, the fraction of particles remaining after a time `t` in the lab frame is:\n`N(t) / N₀ = e^(-t / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nIn this problem, the time `t` is the time it takes for the particles to travel from the center of the detector to its inner wall, a distance equal to the radius `R`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the time of flight in the lab frame is:\n`t ≈ R / c`\n\nSubstituting this into the decay equation gives the fraction of particles that reach the detector wall:\n`Fraction Reaching Detector = N/N₀ = e^(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))`\n\nThe term `R / (c * τ₀)` contains constants related to the detector setup and the particle type. Let's call this constant `K`:\n`K = R / (c * τ₀)`\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n`Fraction Reaching Detector = e^(-K / γ)`\n\n### Applying the Given Conditions\n\n**Condition 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n*   Fraction reaching the detector = `1/3`.\n\nPlugging these values into our simplified equation:\n`1/3 = e^(-K / 20)`\n\nTo solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`ln(3) = K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Condition 2:**\n*   Fraction reaching the detector = `2/3`.\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nUsing the same equation with the new values:\n`2/3 = e^(-K / γ₂)`\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n`ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n\nNow, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n### Calculating the Final Answer\n\nSubstitute the expression for `K` that we found from Condition 1 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 28\nB) 54\nC) 40\nD) 68\n\nThe calculated value of `~54.2` is closest to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
