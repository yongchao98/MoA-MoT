    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the proper lifetime (τ) of the particle.**\n    The proper lifetime `τ` is related to the decay width `Γ` by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n    `τ = ħ / Γ`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`6.582 × 10⁻²² MeV·s`).\n    Given `Γ_X = 320 MeV`, the proper lifetime is:\n    `τ = (6.582 × 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV ≈ 2.057 × 10⁻²⁴ s`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor `γ` is the ratio of the particle's total energy `E` to its rest mass energy `mc²`.\n    Given `E_X = 8 GeV` and `m_X = 1.2 GeV/c²`, the Lorentz factor is:\n    `γ = E_X / m_Xc² = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3 ≈ 6.67`\n\n3.  **Calculate the particle's velocity (v) as a fraction of the speed of light (β = v/c).**\n    The velocity `β` is related to the Lorentz factor `γ` by:\n    `β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) `\n    `β = sqrt(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) ≈ 0.9887`\n\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (d).**\n    The mean decay distance in the lab frame is the distance the particle travels during its lifetime as measured in the lab frame (`τ' = γτ`).\n    `d = v * τ' = (βc) * (γτ) = γ * β * c * τ`\n    Plugging in the values:\n    `d ≈ (20/3) * 0.9887 * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 × 10⁻²⁴ s)`\n    `d ≈ 4.0655 × 10⁻¹⁵ m`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nB) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nC) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nD) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
