    "The scenario described compares the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1) to the mean free path of electrons from a high-energy beam colliding with those same gas molecules (λ2). The temperature and pressure, and therefore the number density of the gas molecules, remain constant.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the physics involved:\n\n*   **Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. It is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ): λ = 1/(nσ).\n*   **λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):** In this case, both the projectile and the target are gas molecules of roughly the same size. The collision cross-section, σ1, is related to the physical size of the molecules. The standard formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule among others of the same type is λ1 = 1/(√2 * π * d² * n), where 'd' is the molecular diameter and 'n' is the number of molecules per unit volume. The √2 factor accounts for the relative motion of the target molecules.\n*   **λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions):** Here, the projectile is an electron, and the target is a gas molecule. An electron is a point-like particle, orders of magnitude smaller than a gas molecule. Therefore, the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule, σ2, is primarily determined by the size of the target molecule. In a simplified hard-sphere model, treating the electron as a point particle, the cross-section is approximately σ2 ≈ π*(d/2)² = (πd²)/4.\n\n**Comparing the two scenarios:**\n\nSince the number density 'n' of gas molecules is the same for both λ1 and λ2, the difference between them depends entirely on their respective collision cross-sections (σ1 and σ2).\n\n1.  **Collision Cross-Section for λ1:** σ1 ≈ √2 * π * d²\n2.  **Collision Cross-Section for λ2:** σ2 ≈ (π * d²) / 4\n\nComparing these two cross-sections, we find that the effective area for a molecule-molecule collision is significantly larger than for an electron-molecule collision.\n\nBecause the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section, a smaller cross-section results in a longer mean free path. The electron, being a much smaller projectile, is far less likely to collide with a gas molecule than another gas molecule is. Consequently, the electron will, on average, travel a much greater distance before a collision.\n\nTherefore, the mean free path of the electron (λ2) will be significantly larger than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1). This rules out options A and D. Comparing our simplified models, the ratio λ2/λ1 is approximately (√2 * π * d²) / ((π * d²) / 4), which simplifies to 4√2, or about 5.66. This value is substantially greater than 1.22, making option C the only plausible conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>"
