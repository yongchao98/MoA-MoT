    "This is a physics problem that can be solved by combining the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black body radiation, Wien's displacement law, and the formula for the Doppler shift.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a perfect black body, is given by the formula L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Given Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii is:\n    R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n    (R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio using Wien's Law and Doppler Shift**:\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law** states that the temperature (T) of a black body is inversely proportional to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak emitted wavelength, λ_em): T = b / λ_em, where 'b' is Wien's constant. Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is T₁ / T₂ = λ_em,₂ / λ_em,₁.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths (λ_obs) are the same for both stars. However, the temperature is related to the wavelength *emitted* by the star (λ_em), which can be different from the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect caused by the star's radial velocity.\n    *   The relationship between observed and emitted wavelength is given by λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v/c) for an object moving away (redshift), where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity v₁ = 0, so its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_em,₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. It is moving away, so its light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since we are given that λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can state: λ_em,₁ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths: λ_em,₂ / λ_em,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   This means the temperature ratio is T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Calculation**:\n    *   We have all the components for the luminosity ratio: L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * (T₁ / T₂)⁴.\n    *   Substituting the temperature ratio: L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴.\n    *   Let's plug in the values:\n        *   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n        *   c (speed of light) ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n        *   v₂/c ≈ 700,000 / 299,792,458 ≈ 0.002335\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002335)⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002335)⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009377\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>"
