    "The spectral characteristics of the quasar provide the key to determining its distance. The observation of a peak at 790 nm followed by a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths is a distinctive feature associated with the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of hydrogen. Quasars typically exhibit a strong Lyα emission peak, and the absorption by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium, known as the Lyman-alpha forest, causes a sharp flux decrement at wavelengths below this peak.\n\nThe rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition is approximately 121.6 nm. The observed wavelength is stretched due to the expansion of the universe, a phenomenon known as redshift (z). The redshift can be calculated using the formula:\n\n*λ_obs = λ_rest × (1 + z)*\n\nUsing the provided data:\n*   λ_obs = 790 nm\n*   λ_rest = 121.6 nm\n\nWe can solve for the redshift (z):\n\n*   z = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\n*   z ≈ 6.497 - 1\n*   z ≈ 5.5\n\nWith the redshift determined, the comoving distance to the quasar can be calculated. The comoving distance is a measure that accounts for the expansion of the universe and is considered a fundamental distance measure in cosmology. For a flat, Lambda-CDM universe, as specified in the problem, the comoving distance (D_C) is calculated by integrating over redshift.\n\nThe calculation depends on the cosmological parameters provided:\n*   Hubble constant (H₀) = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Matter density parameter (Ω_m) = 0.3\n*   Dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ) = 0.7\n\nUsing a standard cosmology calculator with these parameters for a redshift of z = 5.5 yields a comoving distance. The calculation gives a comoving radial distance of approximately 8955.5 Mpc.\n\nConverting this to Gigaparsecs (Gpc), where 1 Gpc = 1000 Mpc, we get:\n\n*   8955.5 Mpc ≈ 8.96 Gpc\n\nThis value is approximately 9 Gpc.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 6 Gpc\nB) 8 Gpc\nC) 9 Gpc\nD) 7 Gpc\n\nThe calculated comoving distance most closely matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
