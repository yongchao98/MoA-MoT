    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound D:\n\n**1. Identification of Compound A:**\n\nThe proton NMR data for compound A shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H). This spectrum, particularly the 6H/4H integration ratio and the triplet/quartet splitting pattern, is a classic signature for two equivalent ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). However, the description of compound A undergoing monobromination followed by elimination to form an alkene suggests that compound A is an alkane. The simplest alkane that fits the subsequent reactions is n-butane. Although the Â¹H-NMR spectrum of n-butane is technically more complex than described (a triplet and a multiplet), the provided spectrum is a common simplification. Thus, we can deduce Compound A is **n-butane**.\n\n**2. Identification of Compound B:**\n\nCompound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form compound B. The bromination of butane can produce 1-bromobutane and 2-bromobutane. Due to the greater stability of the secondary radical intermediate, **2-bromobutane** is the major product.\n\n**3. Identification of Compound C:**\n\nCompound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a classic dehydrohalogenation reaction (elimination). According to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene is the major product, which in this case is but-2-ene. But-1-ene is also formed as a minor product. The problem states that compound C has two geometrical isomers, which corresponds to the *cis* and *trans* isomers of **but-2-ene**. The reaction proceeds to use the *cis*-isomer of compound C.\n\n**4. Identification of Compound D:**\n\nCompound D is the product of a Diels-Alder reaction between the *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene, the dienophile) and (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol (the diene). This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the product is determined by the following principles:\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Dienophile:** The *cis* relationship of the two methyl groups in *cis*-but-2-ene is retained in the product. Therefore, the two methyl groups at positions C5 and C6 of the new ring will be *cis* to each other.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Diene:** For an (E,E)-diene like (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol, the two \"outer\" substituents (the -OH at C1 and the -CH3 at C4) will end up *cis* to each other in the final product.\n*   **The Endo Rule:** The Diels-Alder reaction preferentially proceeds through an *endo* transition state. This means the substituents of the dienophile (the two methyl groups) are oriented *trans* to the \"outer\" substituents of the diene (the -OH group and the C4-methyl group).\n\nCombining these rules, the final product D, which is named 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol, will have the following relative stereochemistry:\n*   The hydroxyl group at C1 and the methyl group at C4 are *cis*.\n*   The methyl groups at C5 and C6 are *cis*.\n*   The {C1-OH, C4-Me} pair is *trans* to the {C5-Me, C6-Me} pair.\n\nAssigning the absolute configuration (R/S) based on this relative stereochemistry yields **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
