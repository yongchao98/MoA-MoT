    "My derivation of the operator for the spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane is:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle with the z-axis. This is confirmed by multiple sources. The problem asks for the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$.\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is:\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nCanceling $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides, we get:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis leads to the system of equations:\n1. $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n2. $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation:\n$b\\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\nUsing the half-angle identities $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$, we get:\n$b \\cdot 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\cdot 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n$b\\cos(\\theta/2) = a\\sin(\\theta/2)$\n$b = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)}$\n\nSo the eigenvector is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} \\end{pmatrix}$. To make this look simpler, we can choose a convenient value for $a$. If we set $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$, then $b = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nThe unnormalized eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nTo normalize this vector, we need to divide it by its magnitude. The magnitude squared is:\n$(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\nThe magnitude is $\\sqrt{1} = 1$. The vector is already normalized.\n\nThus, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\nThis is a standard result in quantum mechanics. The general spin-up eigenstate for a direction $\\vec{n}$ defined by polar angle $\\theta$ and azimuthal angle $\\phi$ is $|\\psi_+\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ e^{i\\phi}\\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. Since the direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$. Substituting $\\phi=0$ into the general formula gives the eigenvector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect due to the presence of $\\hbar$ and incorrect normalization factors.\nB) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Correct.\nC) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect. The arguments should be $\\theta/2$, not $\\theta$.\nD) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect due to $\\hbar$ and lack of dependence on $\\theta$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
