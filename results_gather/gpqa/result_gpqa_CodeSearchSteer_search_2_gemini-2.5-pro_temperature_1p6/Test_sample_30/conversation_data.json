    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\nThis reaction is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration) of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-director. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. The para isomer, p-nitrotoluene, is typically the major product and will be considered as product 1.\n\n*   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene. While strong oxidants like KMnO₄ would convert the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, the combination of manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid under controlled conditions can act as a milder oxidizing agent. A plausible and common transformation for benzylic methyl groups is oxidation to an aldehyde. This is particularly relevant as it leads to a standard subsequent reaction. Another possibility is oxidation to a carboxylic acid, though this often requires harsher conditions or different catalysts. Assuming the intended product is the aldehyde:\n\n*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzaldehyde\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\nThis is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The strong base, NaOH, removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate nucleophile. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde, which has no α-hydrogens. The initial addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated system.\n\nThe final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The trans (E) isomer is favored due to lower steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n\n**Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group, we must analyze the symmetry elements of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\nThe structure is: `CH₃-C(O)-CH=CH-(p-C₆H₄)-NO₂`\n\n1.  **Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** The molecule does not possess any rotational axes (other than the trivial C₁ axis) that would map it onto itself.\n2.  **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n3.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The extensive conjugated system (the benzene ring, the nitro group, the carbon-carbon double bond, and the carbonyl group) strongly favors a planar arrangement of the molecule's heavy-atom backbone. If we consider the plane that contains this `O=C-C=C-Ar-NO₂` framework, we must check if it acts as a mirror plane for the entire molecule. The only group not fully contained within this plane is the methyl (-CH₃) group. By rotating the methyl group, it can be oriented so that one of its hydrogen atoms lies within this plane, while the other two hydrogen atoms are positioned symmetrically above and below the plane. In this conformation, the plane containing the main molecular framework becomes a plane of symmetry (σ).\n\nA molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
