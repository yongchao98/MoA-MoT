    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The key is the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF=31.96%) in substance A2. Let Y be the element and A2 have the formula YF&#x208B;. The mass percentage of fluorine is calculated as:\n    ɷF = (n × Molar Mass of F) / (Molar Mass of Y + n × Molar Mass of F)\n\n    By testing plausible elements and their known fluorides, we find that the chemical properties described for A1, A2, and A3 strongly point to Platinum (Pt), even though the mass percentage match is not perfect.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Platinum Hypothesis:**\n    *   **Element Y = Platinum (Pt).**\n    *   **A1, the bright-red substance that oxidizes xenon**: This perfectly matches the description of Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆). PtF₆ is a deep red solid and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon, a noble gas.\n    *   **A1 decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine**: PtF₆ is known to be unstable and can decompose into a lower fluoride and fluorine gas. The most likely product is Platinum pentafluoride (PtF₅). Thus, **A1 = PtF₆** and **A2 = PtF₅**.\n    *   **Mass percentage check for A2 = PtF₅**: Using M(Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol and M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol, the molar mass of PtF₅ is 290.08 g/mol. The mass percentage of fluorine is (5 × 19.00) / 290.08 ≈ 32.75%. This is reasonably close to the 31.96% given in the problem, suggesting a slight approximation in the problem's value.\n    *   **A3 interacts with xenon and is formed by fluorination of Y**: PtF₆ is formed by the direct fluorination of platinum metal and it reacts with xenon. Thus, **A3 = PtF₆**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4:**\n    *   **Reaction for A5**: A5 is formed by adding element Y (Platinum metal, Pt) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This suggests a comproportionation reaction where platinum in different oxidation states reacts to form an intermediate oxidation state. The most common states for platinum are 0, +2, and +4. A 1:1 molar ratio strongly implies the reaction:\n        **Pt(0) + Pt(IV) → 2 Pt(II)**\n    *   **Identify A4 and A5**: This reaction scheme means that A4 must be a Platinum(IV) compound, and A5 must be a Platinum(II) compound.\n    *   **Decomposition of A5**: The clue that A5 decomposes in water into two substances is consistent with the behavior of some Pt(II) compounds, which can disproportionate back into Pt(0) and a Pt(IV) compound, often regenerating the starting materials.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**:\n    *   Based on the analysis, A4 is a compound of Platinum(IV).\n    *   Any compound containing a platinum atom must have a molecular weight greater than the atomic weight of platinum itself, which is approximately 195.08 g/mol.\n    *   Let's examine the given options for the molecular weight range of A4:\n        *   A) 140-160\n        *   B) 160-180\n        *   C) 110-130\n        *   D) 220-240\n    *   Only range D) 220-240 is greater than 195.08 g/mol. Therefore, by elimination, the molecular weight of A4 must fall within this range. While identifying the exact colorless, soluble Pt(IV) compound can be difficult (many are colored or insoluble), logical deduction points to only one possible answer range. For example, platinum(IV) oxide, PtO₂, has a molar mass of approximately 227 g/mol, which falls in this range, though its properties do not perfectly match the description.\n\nThe logical path of identifying Y as Platinum and A4 as a Pt(IV) compound leads to the conclusion that its molecular weight must be in the 220-240 g/mol range.\n\n<<<D>>>"
