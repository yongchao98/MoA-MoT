    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of Titanium atoms in two energy levels changes, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the population of atoms in different energy states in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### Analysis\nThe problem compares a star in two states: one without dark spots and one with 40% of its surface covered by spots. We are given the following information:\n-   **No spots:** The effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K.\n-   **With spots:** The overall effective temperature decreases to 5500 K.\n-   **Transition:** The energy transition between the two levels (level 1 and level 2) of neutral Titanium (Ti) corresponds to a wavelength (λ) of approximately 1448 Å.\n-   **Observation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 decreases when the star has spots.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation for the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, N₂ (higher) and N₁ (lower), is given by:\n\n```\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n```\nWhere:\n*   `N₂` and `N₁` are the number of atoms in the upper and lower energy levels, respectively.\n*   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels (which cancel out when taking a ratio of ratios).\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels (`E₂ - E₁`).\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature of the photosphere.\n\nThe problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present, which confirms that the temperature used for the spotted case must be lower than for the unspotted case, and the ratio in question is `N₂ / N₁`.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):**\n    The energy difference corresponding to a wavelength `λ = 1448 Å` (or 1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m) is calculated using the formula `ΔE = hc/λ`, where `h` is the Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `h` ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `ΔE = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J`\n\n2.  **Determine the temperatures:**\n    We use the effective temperatures given for the photosphere in both cases as the characteristic temperatures for the Boltzmann equation. This is a standard approximation in stellar astrophysics when assuming LTE.\n    *   Temperature without spots, `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    *   Temperature with spots, `T_spots = 5500 K`\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio of the ratios:**\n    We need to find the factor `F` by which the population ratio changes. This is the ratio of the population ratio without spots to the population ratio with spots:\n\n    `F = (N₂/N₁)_nospots / (N₂/N₁)_spots`\n\n    `F = [C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))] / [C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))]`\n\n    `F = exp[(-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots)]`\n\n    `F = exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots)]`\n\n4.  **Compute the final value:**\n    Using the value of `k ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K`:\n    *   `ΔE / k ≈ (1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99420 K`\n    *   `1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots = 1/5500 K - 1/6000 K = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) K⁻¹ ≈ 1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹`\n    *   `F = exp(99420 * 1.515 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ exp(1.506)`\n    *   `F ≈ 4.509`\n\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5. This means the population ratio `N₂/N₁` was about 4.5 times larger when the star had no spots compared to when it had spots.\n\n<<<C>>>"
