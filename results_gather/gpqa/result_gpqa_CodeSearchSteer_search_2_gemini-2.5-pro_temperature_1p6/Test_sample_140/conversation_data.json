    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide base can abstract a proton from either position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In this specific molecule, it can remove the deuterium from carbon-2 or the hydrogen from carbon-6.\n    *   **Pathway A: Removal of Hydrogen from C-6:** The amide ion removes the hydrogen atom at the C-6 position. This is generally faster than removing deuterium (due to the kinetic isotope effect). The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C-1 results in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom remains on the ring at the C-2 position.\n    *   **Pathway B: Removal of Deuterium from C-2:** The amide ion removes the deuteron from the C-2 position. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C-1 forms a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C-1 and C-2. In this process, the deuterium label is removed from the molecule.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion (or ammonia, followed by deprotonation) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n    *   **Products from Pathway A's Intermediate (Deuterium at C-2):**\n        *   Attack at C-1: The amino group (-NH2) adds to C-1. This leads to the formation of **aniline-2-d** (o-deuteroaniline).\n        *   Attack at C-6: The amino group adds to C-6. When numbering the resulting aniline product from the amino group, the deuterium is at the C-3 position. This product is **aniline-3-d** (m-deuteroaniline). Experimental studies on similar deuterated halobenzenes have shown that the deuterium in the resulting aniline is distributed between the ortho and meta positions.\n    *   **Product from Pathway B's Intermediate (No Deuterium):**\n        *   This benzyne has no deuterium label. Nucleophilic attack by the amide ion at either C-1 or C-2, followed by protonation, results in a single, unlabeled product: **aniline**.\n\nCombining the outcomes of both pathways, three distinct organic products are possible:\n1.  Aniline-2-d\n2.  Aniline-3-d\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
