    "Of the theories listed, Superstring Theory is the one that is understood to not require regularization at high energies.\n\nQuantum Electrodynamics (QED), Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and even Classical Electrodynamics all encounter infinities in their calculations that necessitate a process of regularization and renormalization. In QED and QCD, these infinities arise from loop diagrams in perturbative calculations that correspond to very high energies or, equivalently, very short distances. Classical Electrodynamics faces a similar issue with the self-energy of a point-like charged particle, which becomes infinite.\n\nSuperstring Theory, by its fundamental nature, is believed to be free of these ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences. Instead of point-like particles, the fundamental objects in string theory are one-dimensional strings. The interactions between these strings are \"smeared out\" in a way that avoids the infinities that plague quantum field theories at extremely small distance scales. While superstring theories can have other types of divergences, such as infrared divergences, they are not expected to require regularization at high energies.\n\nIn contrast, Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory of the strong nuclear force, requires regularization methods like lattice QCD to perform calculations. Although it exhibits a property called asymptotic freedom, where the interactions become weaker at higher energies, the theory itself is not free from the need for regularization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
