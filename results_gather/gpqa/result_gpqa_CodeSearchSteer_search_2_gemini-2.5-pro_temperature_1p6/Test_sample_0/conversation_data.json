    "To resolve two distinct energy levels, the difference between their energies must be greater than the natural energy width of each level. This energy width is a consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) are related by the formula:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s. This inherent uncertainty in energy is also known as lifetime broadening.\n\nA shorter lifetime leads to a greater uncertainty or \"width\" of the energy level. To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, their separation must be larger than these individual widths.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each quantum state:\n\n1.  **For the first state (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ sec):**\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **For the second state (τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ sec):**\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe energy widths of the two levels are approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV and 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV. The broader of the two widths is associated with the shorter lifetime (τ₁), and is about 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. For the energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than this value.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is substantially greater than the broader energy width of ~10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **B) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This value is much smaller than both energy widths.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This value is smaller than the broader energy width.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This value is much smaller than the broader energy width.\n\nThe only energy difference that is sufficiently large to allow the two levels to be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
