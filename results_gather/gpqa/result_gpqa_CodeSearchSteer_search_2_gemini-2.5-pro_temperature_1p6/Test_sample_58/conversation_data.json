    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of the acids and the base and then determine which species is in excess after the neutralization reactions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each component:**\n    *   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n        Moles = Volume (L) × Molarity (M)\n        Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 M = 0.050 mol\n    *   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n        Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 M = 0.080 mol\n        Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n        Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 M = 0.090 mol\n        Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), the moles of OH⁻ ions are:\n        Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n2.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n    *   First, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂).\n        H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n        Initial moles: 0.080 mol H⁺ and 0.180 mol OH⁻.\n        The H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant.\n        Moles of OH⁻ remaining after reacting with HCl = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol.\n\n    *   Next, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) reacts with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n        CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n        Initial moles: 0.050 mol CH₃COOH and 0.100 mol OH⁻.\n        The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant.\n        Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol.\n\n3.  **Determine the final composition and calculate the pH:**\n    *   After all reactions, the solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of a strong base (OH⁻). The presence of this strong base will be the primary determinant of the solution's pH.\n    *   The total volume of the solution is the sum of the individual volumes:\n        Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n    *   Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻.\n        [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n        [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n    *   Calculate the pOH:\n        pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n        pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   Calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14:\n        pH = 14 - pOH\n        pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
