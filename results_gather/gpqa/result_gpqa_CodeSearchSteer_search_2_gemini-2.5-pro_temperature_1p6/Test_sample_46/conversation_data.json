    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 often suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and an additional double bond or ring.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. Its position is typical for an ester (around 1735-1750 cm⁻¹) but can be lowered by conjugation. It is generally too high for a simple amide, which usually appears around 1630-1690 cm⁻¹. This C=O bond accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents three protons, and the triplet (t) splitting pattern indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group. This is characteristic of the methyl (-CH3) end of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is highly suggestive of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet represents two protons and is coupled to a -CH3 group, confirming the presence of an ethyl (-CH2CH3) group. The downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates the -CH2- is attached to an electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an ethoxy group (-O-CH2-).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) are both doublets, each integrating to two protons. This symmetrical pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents have different electronic effects; one is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm), and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n1.  The DoU of 5 and the NMR aromatic signals point to a substituted benzene ring. The NMR splitting pattern specifically indicates a **1,4- (para) disubstitution**.\n2.  The IR and NMR data confirm a **primary amine (-NH2)** group. This is a strong electron-donating group.\n3.  The combined NMR signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm an **ethyl group attached to an oxygen**.\n4.  The IR signal at 1720 cm⁻¹ confirms a **carbonyl group**, which is part of an ester (-COO-). This is a strong electron-withdrawing group.\n5.  Putting these pieces together (a para-substituted ring, an -NH2 group, and an ethyl ester group) leads to the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### 5. Verifying the Candidate Structures\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, so the C=O stretch would likely be at a lower frequency than 1720 cm⁻¹. It also contains a secondary amine (N-H), which would show only one band in the IR, not two.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has a propionate group, not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show signals for a -CH2-CH3 group attached to the carbonyl, which would have different chemical shifts.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has an amide functional group and is meta-substituted (1,3-), which would lead to a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The IR shows a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester (-COOR). The NMR shows an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen, a primary amine, and the classic 1,4-disubstituted aromatic pattern caused by a strong electron-donating group (-NH2) and a strong electron-withdrawing group (-COOEt).\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided data, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
