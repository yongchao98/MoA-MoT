    "This problem requires evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a radially symmetric vector field, `f(r) = (1/r²) * r̂`, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The vector `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction. This can be solved using two methods: direct calculation of the divergence or applying the Divergence Theorem.\n\n### Method 1: Direct Calculation\nThe formula for the divergence of a vector field `F` in spherical coordinates is:\n`∇ ⋅ F = (1/r²) * ∂(r² * F_r)/∂r + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂(sinθ * F_θ)/∂θ + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂F_φ/∂φ`\n\nFor the given field `f(r)`, the components are:\n*   `f_r = 1/r²`\n*   `f_θ = 0`\n*   `f_φ = 0`\n\nSubstituting these into the divergence formula for any point where `r ≠ 0`:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r²) * ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`\n\nThis result of zero is valid everywhere except at the origin (`r = 0`), where the field is singular. At the origin, the divergence is undefined and can be treated as a Dirac delta function. Specifically, the divergence is `∇ ⋅ (r̂/r²) = 4πδ(r)`, where `δ(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function.\n\nThe volume integral then becomes:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ(r) dV`\n\nSince the volume of integration (the sphere of radius R) includes the origin, the integral evaluates to `4π`.\n\n### Method 2: The Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the flux of that field through the closed surface enclosing the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ n) dS`\n\nHere, the surface `S` is the sphere of radius R.\n*   The vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R²) * r̂`.\n*   The outward-pointing unit normal vector `n` on the surface of the sphere is `r̂`.\n*   The differential surface area element is `dS`.\n\nThe surface integral is:\n`∮_S ( (1/R²) * r̂ ) ⋅ (r̂ dS) = ∮_S (1/R²) dS`\n\nSince `1/R²` is constant over the surface, it can be taken out of the integral:\n`(1/R²) * ∮_S dS`\n\nThe integral `∮_S dS` is the total surface area of the sphere, which is `4πR²`.\n\nTherefore, the flux is:\n`(1/R²) * (4πR²) = 4π`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. A direct calculation of the divergence appears to be zero, but this overlooks the singularity at the origin. The Divergence Theorem correctly handles this by relating the volume integral to the flux through the boundary, resulting in the value of 4π.\n\nThe most appropriate answer is 4π.\n\n<<<B>>>"
