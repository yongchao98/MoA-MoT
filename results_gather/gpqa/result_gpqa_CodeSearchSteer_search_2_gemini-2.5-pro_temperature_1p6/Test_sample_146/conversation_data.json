    "To determine the velocity of particle A, we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to the annihilation process.\n\n### 1. Initial State\nThe process begins with a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The phrase \"slowly moving\" implies their kinetic energies are negligible. Therefore, the total initial energy is approximately the sum of their rest energies. The total initial momentum is approximately zero.\n\n*   **Rest Energy of a Proton ($m_p c^2$):** The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.3 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest energy.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy ($E_i$):**\n    $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum ($P_i$):**\n    Since both particles are nearly at rest, the total initial momentum is $P_i \\approx 0$.\n\n### 2. Final State\nThe annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n\n*   **Rest Energy of Particle A ($m_A c^2$):** The problem states this is 300 MeV.\n\n*   **Total Final Energy ($E_f$):** The final energy is the sum of the total relativistic energies of the four A particles. Due to conservation of momentum, the four particles must move off in such a way that their total momentum is zero. By symmetry, each of the four particles will have the same kinetic energy, and thus the same total energy ($E_A$) and speed.\n    $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n### 3. Conservation of Energy\nEquating the initial and final energies:\n$E_i = E_f$\n$1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n$1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\n### 4. Solving for Velocity\nFirst, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNext, we solve for the velocity, $v$, using the definition of the Lorentz factor. Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is therefore approximately $0.77c$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
