    "Based on electrochemical principles and data, the correct statement is:\n\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nHere is the detailed explanation:\n\n*   **Thermodynamics (Strength as an oxidant):** The strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° value indicates a stronger oxidant.\n    *   In an acidic solution, the reduction reaction is: O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O, with a standard potential of **E° = +1.23 V**.\n    *   In a basic solution, the reduction reaction is: O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻, with a standard potential of **E° = +0.40 V**.\n    *   Since +0.40 V is less positive than +1.23 V, oxygen is thermodynamically a **weaker** oxidizing agent in basic solutions compared to acidic ones.\n\n*   **Kinetics (Reaction speed):** The kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are notoriously complex and generally slow, a phenomenon often described as \"sluggish kinetics\". However, when comparing reaction rates in different media, studies show that the reaction is even more sluggish in acidic environments.\n    *   Research indicates that the ORR activity is often higher and the kinetics are faster in alkaline (basic) solutions than in acidic solutions for many catalysts. This is a significant challenge in the development of proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, which operate in acidic conditions. Therefore, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nCombining these two points, the correct terms are **weaker** and **slower**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
