    "The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the nature of radioactive decay. This process is memoryless, which means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The information that the atom has not decayed for the first 50 minutes is therefore irrelevant to the calculation of its future decay probability. We only need to determine the decay probability for a 150-minute interval.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the survival probability:** The probability of an atom *not* decaying within a certain time `t` follows an exponential decay law. This is given by the formula:\n    *   P(survival) = e^(-λt), where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n2.  **Use the given information to find the decay constant (λ):** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   This means the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n    *   So, we have: 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100).\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:** We need to find the probability that the atom decays in a 150-minute period. First, we calculate the probability that it survives this period.\n    *   P(survival in 150 min) = e^(-λ * 150).\n\n4.  **Solve for the new probability:** We can rearrange the equation from step 2 to solve for our new probability without explicitly calculating λ.\n    *   From `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`, we can write `(e^(-λ * 100))^1.5 = 0.68^1.5`.\n    *   This simplifies to `e^(-λ * 150) = 0.68^1.5`.\n    *   Calculating the value: `0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`.\n\n5.  **Find the final decay probability:** The value `0.5607` represents the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes. To find the probability that it *decays* within that time, we subtract this from 1.\n    *   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393.\n\nThis probability, 0.4393, is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
