    "To arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituent on each benzene ring.\n\nThe substances are:\n1)  **C6H5-CH3** (Toluene)\n2)  **C6H5-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  **C6H5-Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n4)  **C6H5-NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n5)  **C6H5-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n6)  **C6H5-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on whether they are activating or deactivating and their directing effects (ortho-, para-, or meta-directing) for electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n*   **Activating, ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups increase the rate of reaction compared to benzene and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   -CH3 (Methyl group)\n    *   -C2H5 (Ethyl group)\n\n*   **Deactivating, ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups decrease the rate of reaction but still direct to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   -Cl (Halogens)\n\n*   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups decrease the rate of reaction and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position.\n    *   -NO2 (Nitro group)\n    *   -COOH (Carboxyl group)\n    *   -COOC2H5 (Ethoxycarbonyl group)\n\n### Step 2: Estimate the para-Isomer Yield for Each Group\n\n**Meta-Directing Groups (Substances 4, 6, and 2):**\nThese substances will produce very low yields of the para-isomer because the substituents direct the bromine to the meta position.\n\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 group is strongly deactivating and meta-directing. During nitration, it yields 90-95% meta-product and only trace amounts of the para-product (0-5%). For bromination, the para yield is exceptionally low, typically less than 1%.\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH group is a deactivating meta-director. For nitration of a similar benzoic ester, the para yield is about 5%. Bromination of benzoic acid gives primarily the meta-isomer. The para-isomer yield is very small, but generally slightly more than that for nitrobenzene.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC2H5 group is also a deactivating meta-director, similar to -COOH. In the nitration of ethyl benzoate, the product distribution is approximately 73% meta, 22% ortho, and 5% para. The para yield for bromination is expected to be similarly low.\n\nAmong these three, the strongly deactivating nitro group gives the lowest para yield. The -COOH and -COOC2H5 groups result in slightly higher, but still very small, para yields. Comparing benzoic acid and ethyl benzoate, their electronic effects are similar, leading to comparable low yields of the para isomer. For the purpose of this ranking, we will consider their para yields to be very low and in the order of their deactivating strength: -NO2 > -COOC2H5 ≈ -COOH. This suggests the increasing order of para yield starts with 4 < 6 ≈ 2.\n\n**Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups (Substances 1, 5, and 3):**\nThese substances will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product is primarily influenced by steric hindrance—larger groups will favor the formation of the para-isomer because it is less sterically hindered than the ortho-positions.\n\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group is weakly activating and ortho-, para-directing. In bromination, toluene yields about 62-67% para-isomer. The remaining major product is the ortho-isomer.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is larger than the methyl group. This increased steric bulk further disfavors substitution at the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene. The para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene's bromination will be higher than that for toluene.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chlorine atom is weakly deactivating but ortho-, para-directing due to the interplay of its inductive and resonance effects. For the nitration of chlorobenzene, the product is a mixture of 30% ortho and 70% para. The isomer distribution for bromination is similar, with the para-isomer being the major product. The percentage of para-bromochlorobenzene is typically around 68-75%. Comparing Cl to the alkyl groups, chlorine is smaller than an ethyl group but its electronic effects also influence the ortho/para ratio. However, the bulky ethyl group is expected to give the highest para-selectivity. The para-selectivity for chlorobenzene and toluene are often close, but ethylbenzene's bulkier nature pushes it higher.\n\n### Step 3: Combine and Rank All Substances\n\nBased on the analysis, we can establish the final order of increasing para-isomer yield.\n\n1.  **Lowest Yields (meta-directors):**\n    *   Nitrobenzene (4) has the lowest yield (<1%).\n    *   Benzoic acid (6) and Ethyl benzoate (2) have very low yields, but slightly higher than nitrobenzene (around 1-5%). Without precise bromination data to differentiate them, their relative order is close, but generally, the trend follows the deactivating strength. So: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n2.  **Higher Yields (ortho-, para-directors):**\n    *   Toluene (1) has a significant para yield (~62%).\n    *   Ethylbenzene (5) has a higher para yield than toluene due to greater steric hindrance from the ethyl group.\n    *   Chlorobenzene (3) also has a high para yield (~70%). The comparison between toluene and chlorobenzene is close, but ethylbenzene is generally considered to produce the highest para-isomer ratio among the simple alkylbenzenes due to sterics. The typical isomer distributions suggest an order of: **1 < 5 < 3**. However, literature values can vary. Let's re-examine the steric and electronic factors.\n    - Steric hindrance: -C2H5 > -CH3 > -Cl. This would predict the para yield order as Cl < CH3 < C2H5.\n    - Isomer ratios from literature for various electrophilic substitutions consistently show the para/ortho ratio increases with the size of the alkyl group (e.g., tert-butyl > ethyl > methyl). Chlorination of toluene gives ~39% para, while for ethylbenzene it is higher. Bromination of chlorobenzene gives a high para yield, often cited around 70-75%. Comparing toluene (~62-67% para) and ethylbenzene (> toluene), and chlorobenzene (~70-75%), the order appears to be **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nLet's combine the two groups: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe derived order **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
