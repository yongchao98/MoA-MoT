    "This is a physics problem that can be solved with the provided information. Here is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n### 1. Understand the Geometry of Transits\n\nA transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its star from our line of sight. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star. For a planet in a circular orbit, if a transit occurs, an occultation will also occur half an orbit later. Therefore, the core of the problem is to find the condition for the second planet to transit.\n\nThe **impact parameter (b)** is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at the midpoint of the transit, expressed in units of the star's radius. A value of `b=0` means the planet passes directly over the center of the star, while `b=1` means the center of the planet passes just along the star's edge (its limb).\n\nA transit event is typically defined as an event where the center of the planet passes across the stellar disk, which means the impact parameter `b` must be less than or equal to 1 (`b <= 1`). The maximum orbital period will correspond to the case with the largest possible orbital distance (semi-major axis), which corresponds to the maximum possible impact parameter, `b=1`.\n\n### 2. Use Planet 1's Data to Determine the System's Inclination\n\nBoth planets are in the same orbital plane, which means they share the same orbital inclination (`i`) relative to our line of sight. The impact parameter `b` is related to the semi-major axis `a`, the stellar radius `R_s`, and the inclination `i` by the formula:\n\n`b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\n\nFor Planet 1, we are given:\n*   `b1 = 0.2`\n*   `P1 = 3 days`\n\nFrom this, we can write:\n`a1 * cos(i) = b1 * R_s = 0.2 * R_s`\n\nThis equation establishes a relationship between the semi-major axis of Planet 1 and the constant `cos(i)` for the system.\n\n### 3. Apply the Transit Condition to Planet 2\n\nFor Planet 2 to have the maximum possible orbital period while still transiting, its impact parameter (`b2`) must be at its maximum allowed value, which we take as `b2 = 1`.\n\nSo, for Planet 2:\n`a2 * cos(i) = b2 * R_s = 1 * R_s = R_s`\n\n### 4. Relate the Orbits of the Two Planets\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1.  `a1 * cos(i) = 0.2 * R_s`\n2.  `a2 * cos(i) = R_s`\n\nBy dividing the second equation by the first, we can eliminate the unknown `cos(i)` and `R_s`:\n`(a2 * cos(i)) / (a1 * cos(i)) = R_s / (0.2 * R_s)`\n`a2 / a1 = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n\nThis means the semi-major axis of Planet 2 is 5 times that of Planet 1. The radii of the planets (`R_p1` and `R_p2`) and the star (`R_s`) are not needed for this part of the calculation, as the `b <= 1` condition makes the result independent of the planet and star radii.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`) of its orbit.\n`P^2 ∝ a^3`\n\nWe can write this as a ratio for our two planets:\n`(P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3`\n\nWe know `P1 = 3 days` and we just found that `a2 / a1 = 5`. Substituting these values:\n`(P2 / 3)^2 = 5^3 = 125`\n\nNow, solve for `P2`:\n`P2 / 3 = sqrt(125)`\n`P2 / 3 = sqrt(25 * 5) = 5 * sqrt(5)`\n`P2 = 3 * 5 * sqrt(5) = 15 * sqrt(5)`\n\nUsing the approximation `sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236`:\n`P2 ≈ 15 * 2.236 = 33.54` days.\n\nThis value is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<B>>>"
