  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus.

    "To identify the issue with the protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Start Codon**: Translation in eukaryotes almost always begins at the first `ATG` codon. The provided sequence starts with `ATG`, which is correct for initiating protein synthesis.\n\n2.  **Identify the HA Tag Sequence**: The plan was to add an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The amino acid sequence for this tag is YPYDVPDYA. The common DNA sequence coding for this is `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT`.\n\n3.  **Examine the Provided DNA Sequence**: Let's break down the initial part of the construct's sequence into three-letter codons:\n    *   `ATG` (Start codon for Methionine)\n    *   `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC` (This corresponds to the amino acid sequence Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala, which is the correct HA tag. `GCC` is a valid codon for Alanine, just like `GCT`.)\n    *   `AAA` (This codes for the amino acid Lysine)\n    *   `TGA` (This is a stop codon.)\n\n4.  **Conclusion from Sequence Analysis**: The DNA sequence contains a `TGA` codon immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and one additional amino acid (Lysine). In the messenger RNA (mRNA), this would be a `UGA` codon. `UGA` is one of the three universal stop codons (along with `UAA` and `UAG`) that signals the ribosome to stop translation. The presence of this premature termination codon (PTC) means that instead of producing the full-length GADD45G protein, the ribosome stops and releases a very short, non-functional peptide. This early termination of translation is the direct cause of the failure to detect the overexpressed protein.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) The ribosome terminated the translation early**: This aligns perfectly with the discovery of a premature `TGA` stop codon in the sequence.\n*   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: While possible in some protein constructs, the primary issue here is that the full protein is never made in the first place due to the stop codon.\n*   **C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: The sequence for the HA tag itself is correct and codes for the intended amino acids. The error lies immediately after it.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: This is biologically incorrect. All organisms have mechanisms to recognize stop codons to terminate translation, not continue it with a tRNA. Furthermore, the codon in question is `TGA`, not `UAA`.\n\nTherefore, the unexpected stop codon caused the ribosome to halt translation prematurely.\n\n<<<A>>>"
