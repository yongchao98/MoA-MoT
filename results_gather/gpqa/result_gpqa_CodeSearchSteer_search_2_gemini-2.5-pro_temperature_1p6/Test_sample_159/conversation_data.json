    "The initial reasoning appears to be correct. Let's confirm the key values and the formula from the search results.\n\n1.  **Aperture Transformation:** An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' indeed approaches a circle of radius 'a' as N approaches infinity. This is a fundamental geometric concept.\n\n2.  **Diffraction Problem:** The setup describes Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture. The resulting pattern is an Airy pattern.\n\n3.  **Intensity and Minima:** The intensity I(θ) of the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a' is given by the formula I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k*a*sinθ) / (k*a*sinθ)]², where J₁ is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind and k = 2π/λ. The minima (dark rings) occur at the zeros of the J₁(x) function.\n\n4.  **Condition for Minima:** The minima occur when the argument of the Bessel function, ρ = k*a*sin(θ), is equal to one of the zeros of J₁(x).\n    Using the small angle approximation (sinθ ≈ θ), this becomes:\n    (2π / λ) * a * θ = zₙ\n    where zₙ are the zeros of J₁(x).\n    Solving for the angular position θ, we get:\n    θₙ = zₙ * λ / (2π * a)\n\n5.  **Zeros of J₁(x):** The search results confirm the values of the first few zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n    *   First zero (z₁): 3.8317\n    *   Second zero (z₂): 7.0156\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is:\n        θ₁ = z₁ * λ / (2π * a) = 3.8317 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is:\n        θ₂ = z₂ * λ / (2π * a) = 7.0156 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a\n\n7.  **Angular Distance:** The angular distance between these two minima is:\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁\n    Δθ ≈ (1.1165 - 0.6098) * λ / a\n    Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * λ / a\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\nSome search results give the formula for the first minimum as θ = 1.22λ/D, where D is the diameter. Let's check this for consistency. Here, the aperture is a circle of radius 'a', so its diameter D = 2a.\nθ₁ = 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.61 * λ / a.\nThe factor 1.22 is an approximation of z₁/π = 3.8317/π ≈ 1.2197. So this confirms the position of the first minimum. The more precise formula using the zeros of the Bessel function is appropriate here. My calculation is consistent with the standard formulas.\n\nThe calculation for the angular separation between the first and second minima, Δθ ≈ 0.506 * λ / a, is therefore correct.\n\nThe steps and conclusion are sound.\n\nFinal Answer check:\n*   Aperture: N-sided polygon with N -> ∞, apothem 'a' -> Circle of radius 'a'.\n*   Diffraction: Fraunhofer from circular aperture.\n*   Minima positions: θ_n = z_n * λ / (2π * a).\n*   z_1 ≈ 3.8317.\n*   z_2 ≈ 7.0156.\n*   θ_1 ≈ 0.610 * λ/a.\n*   θ_2 ≈ 1.117 * λ/a.\n*   Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 ≈ (1.117 - 0.610) * λ/a = 0.507 * λ/a.\n*   This matches option B: 0.506 λ / a. The minor difference is due to rounding. My more precise calculation was 0.5067. Option B is the closest.\n\nThe question is clearly about the angular separation between the first and second dark rings in the Airy pattern. The logic holds up.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  An N-sided polygon with an infinitely large number of sides and a constant apothem 'a' converges to a circle of radius 'a'.\n2.  The problem concerns Fraunhofer diffraction from this circular aperture, which creates an Airy pattern.\n3.  The angular positions (θ) of the minima (dark rings) in the Airy pattern are given by the equation sin(θ) ≈ θ = zₙ * λ / (2π * a), where zₙ are the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind (J₁).\n4.  The first zero of J₁(x) is z₁ ≈ 3.8317.\n5.  The second zero of J₁(x) is z₂ ≈ 7.0156.\n6.  The angular position of the first minimum is θ₁ = 3.8317 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a.\n7.  The angular position of the second minimum is θ₂ = 7.0156 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a.\n8.  The angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between these two angles:\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1165 - 0.6098) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.5067 * λ / a.\n9.  This value corresponds to the provided option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
