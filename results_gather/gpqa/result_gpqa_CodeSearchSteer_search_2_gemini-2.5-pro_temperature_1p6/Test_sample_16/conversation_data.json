    "The provided information and the initial calculation appear to be consistent and correct. The problem requires finding the equilibrium concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions from a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe formation constant, K_f (also denoted as KCa-EDTA), is the equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\nGiven:\n*   Initial concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 M\n*   K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n*   The problem assumes an ideal pH, which means the EDTA is predominantly in its fully deprotonated form (EDTA⁴⁻), so we can use the given formation constant directly without needing to calculate a conditional formation constant.\n\nLet 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions. From the dissociation stoichiometry, the equilibrium concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x'. The equilibrium concentration of the complex will be the initial concentration minus the amount that dissociated, which is (0.02 - x) M.\n\nAt equilibrium:\n*   [Ca²⁺] = x\n*   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n*   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n\nSubstituting these into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\nBecause the formation constant K_f is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex), meaning the dissociation is minimal. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex. We can make the simplifying approximation:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow the equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nSolving for x²:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nNow, solving for x, which is the concentration of Ca²⁺:\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\nx = (√40) x 10⁻⁷\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis result matches one of the options.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\n√40 is approximately 6.32.\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
