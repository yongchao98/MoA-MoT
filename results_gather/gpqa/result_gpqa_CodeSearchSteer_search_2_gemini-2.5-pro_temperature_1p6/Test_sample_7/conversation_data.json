    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Single-Mutant Phenotypes\n*   **Wild-Type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is the baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 causes a partial loss of resistance. This means G1 contributes to the plant's defense.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 completely eliminates all resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for this resistance pathway. Its phenotype is the most severe.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 also causes a partial loss of resistance, and its effect is stronger than the loss of G1.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Double-Mutant Phenotypes and Epistasis\nEpistasis occurs when the phenotype of one gene mutation masks the phenotype of another. In a double mutant, if the phenotype resembles one of the single mutants, that gene is said to be epistatic to the other.\n\n*   **g1g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g1` single mutant (75%). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This suggests that G1 and G2 function in the same pathway, with G2 acting downstream of G1, or G2 being the essential component whose loss cannot be compensated for.\n*   **g2g3 mutant:** 0% resistance. Similarly, this phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g3` single mutant (50%). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This suggests G2 is also downstream of G3 or is the ultimate essential gene in their shared pathway.\n*   **g1g3 mutant:** 10% resistance. This phenotype is not the same as the `g1` mutant (75%) or the `g3` mutant (50%). Instead, it's a new, more severe phenotype. This indicates that there is no simple epistatic relationship between G1 and G3. They likely work together, and their combined loss has a synergistic effect, meaning the impact is greater than the sum of their individual effects.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Genetic Pathway and Role of Transcription Factor\nWe know at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of another. Let's build a model consistent with the data.\n\n*   **The central role of G2:** Since the `g2` knockout has a 0% resistance (null) phenotype and is epistatic to both `g1` and `g3`, it is the critical gene in the pathway.\n*   **Hypothesis testing:**\n    *   **Could G2 be the upstream TF?** (i.e., `G2 -> G1`, `G2 -> G3`). If so, a `g2` mutant should have the same phenotype as a `g1g3` double mutant (as G2 would no longer activate them). However, `g2` has 0% resistance while `g1g3` has 10% resistance. The `g2` phenotype is more severe, suggesting G2 controls other resistance genes in addition to potentially G1 and G3. This is a possible model.\n    *   **Could G1 be the upstream TF?** (i.e., `G1 -> G2`). If G1 is a TF that activates G2, then G2 is downstream. A knockout of G2 would result in 0% resistance. The `g1g2` double mutant would also have 0% resistance, meaning G2 is epistatic to G1. This perfectly matches the data. The fact that `g1` only has a partial effect (75% resistance) while `g2` is total (0%) could mean G2 has some baseline activity that G1 enhances. This model is also very plausible.\n\n### 4. Re-evaluate the Options\nLet's check each option against our findings:\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: This is plausible with a pathway model (`G1 -> G2`) that fits the data.\n    *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: We cannot confirm or deny this from the data (pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits), but it doesn't contradict our findings.\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: This is **correct**. The `g1g2` double mutant (0%) has the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant (0%). This option is fully consistent with the experimental data.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This is **incorrect**. The `g1g3` double mutant has a 10% resistance phenotype, which is not the 75% resistance of the `g1` mutant.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: This is **incorrect**. Both single mutants have significant phenotypes (75% and 50% resistance), which argues against redundancy.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This is also **incorrect**.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: This is **incorrect**. The `g1g3` double mutant has a 10% resistance phenotype, which is not the 50% resistance of the `g3` mutant.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one where all claims are either directly supported by the data or are plausible without contradicting the data. The statement \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\" is a direct and correct interpretation of the results.\n\n<<<A>>>"
