    "Here is the analysis to determine the correct option:\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n**Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers, known as tautomers. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, a compound must typically have an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has alpha-hydrogens at the 2, 4, and 6 positions. It can undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of double bonds and do not have any attached hydrogen atoms. Since it lacks alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism and thus does not show this type of isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n**Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes the carbon a chiral center, and the molecule will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (D and L forms).\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups in a *trans* configuration around the carbon-carbon double bond. It does not possess any chiral centers. Furthermore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\nCombining these findings:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
