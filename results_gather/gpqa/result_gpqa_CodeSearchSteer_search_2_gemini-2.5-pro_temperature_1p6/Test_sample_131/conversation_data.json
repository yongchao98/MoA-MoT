    "To solve this problem, a systematic analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectra for each of the potential compounds is required. The molecular formula for all candidate molecules is C10H14. The experimental spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets in the aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals for each compound individually:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Two non-equivalent aromatic protons, which will appear as two separate singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2, the one at C5, and the equivalent pair at C1 and C3. This results in three singlets with a proton ratio of 3H:3H:6H, which simplifies to 1:1:2.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** The two aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent and will produce a single singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent. This leads to two singlets in a 6H:6H or 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** The alkyl protons will show splitting.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing one singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** The spectrum will show a quartet (for the -CH2- groups) and a triplet (for the -CH3 groups), not singlets. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated. This rules out option A.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the remaining options based on a 1:1 mixture:\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   **Aromatic signals:** Would result in three singlets (one from 1,2,4,5- and two from 1,2,3,5-), assuming no signal overlap.\n*   **Aliphatic signals:** Would result in four singlets (one from 1,2,4,5- and three from 1,2,3,5-), assuming no signal overlap.\nThis combination does not match the observed spectrum.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene also gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this combination would show **two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio)**, which perfectly matches the experimental data.\n*   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet corresponding to 12H. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets, each corresponding to 6H. The combined spectrum would therefore show **three singlets with an intensity ratio of 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   **Aromatic signals:** Would result in three singlets (one from 1,2,3,4- and two from 1,2,3,5-), assuming no signal overlap.\n*   **Aliphatic signals:** Would result in five singlets (two from 1,2,3,4- and three from 1,2,3,5-), assuming no signal overlap.\nThis combination does not match the observed spectrum.\n\nBased on this analysis, the mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
