    "### Three of the Listed Stars Would Be Detectable by ESPRESSO\n\nBased on the capabilities of the ESPRESSO spectrograph and the properties of the celestial objects listed, three of them would be detectable. A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel can be achieved during a one-hour exposure.\n\n**ESPRESSO's Detectability Threshold**\n\nThe ESPRESSO spectrograph, when coupled with a single 8.2-meter Very Large Telescope (VLT) Unit Telescope, can achieve the required S/N of 10 in a one-hour exposure for stars as faint as an apparent V magnitude of approximately 16 to 20, depending on the observation mode. For its high-resolution modes with binning (which improves S/N for fainter objects), the limiting magnitude can be around V ~16 mag to V ~18 mag. Even in its most basic high-resolution setting without binning, it can reach about V=17. A scientific paper on ESPRESSO's performance shows that in the High-Resolution (HR) mode with 4x2 binning, the limiting magnitude shifts to about V ~18 mag. The official user manual also indicates that for a 1-hour (3600s) exposure, stars with V magnitudes around 17 are well within the detection limit for achieving a S/N of 10.\n\nHere is a star-by-star analysis:\n\n**a) Canopus:** As the second-brightest star in the night sky, Canopus has an apparent V magnitude of -0.74. It has a declination of about -52° 41', making it easily visible from the Paranal Observatory in Chile, which is located at a latitude of about 24° South. Given its extreme brightness, it is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris:** The North Star, Polaris, has an apparent V magnitude that hovers around 1.98. However, its declination is approximately +89° 15'. Since Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of roughly -24°, Polaris is never visible from the site and is therefore **not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star at 10 pc:** A star with an absolute magnitude of 15 at a distance of 10 parsecs has an apparent magnitude equal to its absolute magnitude.\n*   Using the distance modulus formula, m - M = 5 * log10(d/10), where d=10 pc.\n*   m - 15 = 5 * log10(1) = 0.\n*   The apparent magnitude (m) is 15.\nA star of magnitude 15 is within the detection limits of ESPRESSO for a one-hour exposure to reach a S/N of 10. This star, located on the celestial equator (Dec=0°), would be visible from Paranal. Thus, it is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star at 200 pc:** For a star with an absolute magnitude of 15 at 200 parsecs:\n*   m - 15 = 5 * log10(200/10) = 5 * log10(20) ≈ 5 * 1.301 = 6.505.\n*   The apparent magnitude (m) is approximately 21.5.\nThis is fainter than the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO for the specified observation parameters and is therefore **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star at 5 pc:** For a star with an absolute magnitude of 15 at 5 parsecs:\n*   m - 15 = 5 * log10(5/10) = 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 5 * (-0.301) = -1.505.\n*   The apparent magnitude (m) is approximately 13.5.\nA star of magnitude 13.5 is well within ESPRESSO's capabilities for a one-hour, S/N=10 observation. This star is also visible from Paranal. Thus, it is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star at 50 pc:** For a star with an absolute magnitude of 15 at 50 parsecs:\n*   m - 15 = 5 * log10(50/10) = 5 * log10(5) ≈ 5 * 0.699 = 3.495.\n*   The apparent magnitude (m) is approximately 18.5.\nThis magnitude is at the very edge or beyond the capabilities of the high-resolution modes, even with binning, to achieve a S/N of 10 in one hour. Some performance charts suggest a limiting magnitude around 18 for certain binned modes, but others indicate a limit closer to 17. Given that this is past the reliable detection limit for the specified S/N, it is considered **not detectable**.\n\nIn summary, Canopus, the star at 10 pc (V=15), and the star at 5 pc (V=13.5) are detectable. This makes a total of three.\n\n<<<D>>>"
