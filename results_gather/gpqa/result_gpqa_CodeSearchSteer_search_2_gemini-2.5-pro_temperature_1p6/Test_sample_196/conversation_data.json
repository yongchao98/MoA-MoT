    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing the IR Spectrum of Compound X**\n\nThe provided Infrared (IR) data gives crucial information about the functional groups present in Compound X.\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad band):** This is a highly characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this peak to be exceptionally broad.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\nBased on the IR data, Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X**\n\nThe proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) data allows for the determination of the specific structure.\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this downfield region (typically 10-13 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl group signals:**\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet corresponding to a single proton, likely a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon attached to the benzene ring).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet representing a -CH₂- (methylene) group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons, indicating a -CH₃ (methyl) group next to a -CH group.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons, indicating a -CH₃ group next to a -CH₂- group.\n\nAssembling these pieces, the alkyl group is a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]. This fits the splitting patterns and integrations perfectly. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which corresponds to option B.\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Reaction Product**\n\nCompound X, identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacts with **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃). The red phosphorus regenerates the HI from the iodine formed during the reaction, allowing the reduction to go to completion.\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\nThe -COOH group on the benzoic acid is reduced to a -CH₃ group. The sec-butyl group and the benzene ring remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing the spectral data, Compound X is identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxylic acid to a methyl group. Thus, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material)\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
