    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the solution to the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** Heated to 240°C with excess KOH.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR spectrum: 1720 cm⁻¹. This indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), characteristic of a ketone.\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: 14 total protons.\n*   The reaction conditions (strong base, high temperature) on a dihalide can cause complex rearrangements. The presence of a ketone group and the starting material suggest the formation of an adamantanone derivative. The total proton count of 14 is consistent with the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄O. This corresponds to a saturated adamantane skeleton with one ketone group, for example, adamantan-2-one. This has 4 degrees of unsaturation (3 for the rings, 1 for the C=O).\n*   However, a later reaction step involves ozonolysis, which requires a carbon-carbon double bond. A C=C bond would mean the formula would have to be C₁₀H₁₂O (5 degrees of unsaturation). This contradicts the given ¹H NMR proton count of 14H.\n*   When faced with contradictory information in a multi-step synthesis problem, one must decide which piece of information is most reliable. The conditions for ozonolysis (O₃ at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, DMS) are highly specific for the cleavage of a C=C double bond. It is very likely that this reaction is intended, and therefore the proton count in the NMR spectrum of Product 1 is an error in the problem statement.\n*   Therefore, **Product 1** must be an unsaturated ketone with a C₁₀ skeleton, likely with a rearranged adamantane (protoadamantane) structure formed during the first reaction. A plausible structure for Product 1, formed via rearrangement and oxidation, is **protoadamant-4-en-2-one** (C₁₀H₁₂O).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃).\n*   This is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**, which reduces a ketone to an alcohol.\n*   Therefore, **Product 2** is the corresponding unsaturated alcohol, **protoadamant-4-en-2-ol** (C₁₀H₁₄O). This product contains the C=C double bond required for the next step.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   This is an **ozonolysis** with a reductive workup. The C=C double bond in Product 2 is cleaved to form two carbonyl groups. Since the workup is reductive (DMS), the alcohol group on Product 2 remains unchanged.\n*   The double bond in protoadamant-4-en-2-ol is between C4 and C5. Cleaving this bond opens one of the rings of the tricyclic system, resulting in a bicyclic molecule. The C4 and C5 atoms are converted into aldehyde (-CHO) groups.\n*   **Product 3** is therefore a **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane** derivative which contains an alcohol group at C2 (using the original numbering for reference) and two aldehyde groups where the double bond used to be.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in Product 3**\n\n*   First, we must identify the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton and the aldehyde -CHO protons, which are in a unique chemical shift region).\n*   The protons in Product 3 include those on the bicyclic alkane framework, the alcohol proton (-OH), the aldehyde protons (-CHO), and the proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (the H-C-OH proton).\n*   Comparing these, the H-C-OH proton is significantly deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom and typically appears around 3.5-4.5 ppm, making it the most deshielded non-aldehyde, non-hydroxyl C-H proton.\n*   Now, we must determine its coupling pattern. This proton is located at position C2 of the original protoadamantane framework. The connectivity around this carbon is preserved. C2 is bonded to C1 and C3.\n*   In the protoadamantane (and the resulting bicyclononane) skeleton, both C1 and C3 are bridgehead carbons, and each bears a single proton (C-H).\n*   Therefore, the H-C-OH proton at C2 is coupled to two neighboring protons: the proton on C1 and the proton on C3.\n*   According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' neighboring protons will be split into 'n+1' peaks. Here, n=2.\n*   This would result in a **triplet** (2+1=3), assuming the coupling constants to the two neighboring protons are similar (J_H2,H1 ≈ J_H2,H3), which is a common approximation in such systems for exam purposes. If the coupling constants were significantly different, the pattern would be a doublet of doublets, which is not an option.\n\nFinal Answer: The coupling pattern is a triplet.\n\n<<<A>>>"
