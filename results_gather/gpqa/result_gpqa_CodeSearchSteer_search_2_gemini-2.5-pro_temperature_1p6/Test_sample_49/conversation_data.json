    "To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we must analyze the structure of the mathematical expression provided. The key to this puzzle lies in the factors that are characteristically dependent on the number of loops in a perturbative quantum field theory calculation.\n\nThe expression is: `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`.\n\nLet's break down the components:\n*   **Coupling Constants (`alpha^3 * g^2`)**: The amplitude of a Feynman diagram is proportional to the coupling constants of its vertices. This term tells us the diagram has five vertices in total (three of type `alpha` and two of type `g`).\n*   **Numerical and Kinematic Factors (`sqrt(2) * 8 * (Q/M)^2`)**: These factors arise from the specific rules of the theory (like symmetry factors or group theory constants) and from the evaluation of the integrals over momentum, which depend on the masses (`M`) and external momenta (`Q`). While they are part of the result, they do not have a universal, direct relationship to the number of loops.\n*   **Loop Factor (`1/(4pi)^6`)**: This term is the most revealing. In quantum field theory, calculations of diagrams with loops involve integrating over all possible values of the unconstrained internal momenta. When using the technique of dimensional regularization in a four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a diagram contributes a characteristic factor of `1/(16π^2)` to the final amplitude.\n\nThis crucial factor can be rewritten as:\n\n`1 / (16π^2) = 1 / (4^2 * π^2) = 1 / (4π)^2`\n\nTherefore, for a diagram with `L` loops, the resulting amplitude will contain a factor of `(1 / (4π)^2)^L`, which simplifies to `1 / (4π)^(2L)`.\n\nBy comparing this general formula to the factor found in your colleague's note, `1/(4pi)^6`, we can establish an equation:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L` gives:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nThus, the Feynman diagram must have contained three loops.\n\n<<<D>>>"
