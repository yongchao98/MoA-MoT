    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the final pH of the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Minimum Volume of Strong Acid\n\n1.  **Chemical Reaction:** First, we write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide in a strong monobasic acid (represented by H⁺).\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** We need the molar mass to convert the given mass into moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles\n\n4.  **Calculate Moles of H⁺ Required:** From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of H⁺ are required for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 3 * 0.0009357 moles ≈ 0.002807 moles\n\n5.  **Calculate the Volume of 0.1 M Acid:** The acid has a concentration of 0.1 mol/L (or 0.1 mol/1000 cm³).\n    *   Volume (L) = Moles / Concentration\n    *   Volume (L) = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L ≈ 0.02807 L\n    *   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ **28.07 cm³**\n\n### Part 2: pH of the Resulting Solution\n\nAfter dissolving the Fe(OH)₃, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions. These ions hydrolyze in water, producing an acidic solution.\n\n1.  **Hydrolysis Reaction:** The hexa-aqua iron(III) ion, [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺, acts as a weak acid. For simplicity, we can write the first hydrolysis step as:\n    Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\n2.  **Initial Concentration of Fe³⁺:** The moles of Fe³⁺ formed are equal to the initial moles of Fe(OH)₃ (0.0009357 moles). The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³, or 0.1 L.\n    *   [Fe³⁺]initial = Moles / Volume\n    *   [Fe³⁺]initial = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009357 M\n\n3.  **Acid Dissociation Constant (Ka):** The acidity of the Fe³⁺(aq) ion is described by its Ka value. The equilibrium for the first hydrolysis, Fe³⁺ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺ + H⁺, corresponds to the constant β₁,₁. The log value for this constant (logβ₁,₁) is -2.19.\n    *   log(Ka) = -2.19\n    *   Ka = 10⁻².¹⁹ ≈ 6.457 x 10⁻³\n\n4.  **Equilibrium Calculation (ICE Table):** We set up an ICE table to find the equilibrium concentration of H⁺.\n\n|               | Fe³⁺ (M)     | Fe(OH)²⁺ (M) | H⁺ (M) |\n| :------------ | :------------- | :------------- | :------- |\n| **Initial**   | 0.009357       | 0              | 0      |\n| **Change**    | -x             | +x             | +x       |\n| **Equilibrium** | 0.009357 - x   | x              | x        |\n\n5.  **Solve for [H⁺]:**\n    *   Ka = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n    *   6.457 x 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.009357 - x)\n    *   x² = (6.457 x 10⁻³)(0.009357 - x)\n    *   x² = 6.041 x 10⁻⁵ - 6.457 x 10⁻³x\n    *   x² + (6.457 x 10⁻³)x - 6.041 x 10⁻⁵ = 0\n\n    Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a, we find:\n    *   x ≈ 0.00519 M\n    *   This value represents the equilibrium concentration of H⁺, so [H⁺] ≈ 0.00519 M.\n\n6.  **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = -log[H⁺]\n    *   pH = -log(0.00519) ≈ **2.28**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   **Volume of acid:** ~28.07 cm³\n*   **pH of the resulting solution:** ~2.28\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n*   B) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n*   C) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n*   D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n\nThe calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is very close to the volume in option B (28.05 cm³). The calculated pH (2.28) is also closest to the pH in option B (2.04). The minor discrepancy in the pH value can be attributed to the use of a slightly different Ka value or approximations in the provided options. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
