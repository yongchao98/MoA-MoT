    "Here is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n    We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since T_star, R_star, and the albedo (A) are the same for both planets, these terms cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n2.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity**\n    The maximum radial velocity (K) of a star induced by an orbiting planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\n    Where:\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis (a):\n    a = G * M_p² / (K² * M_star)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    Now we can find the ratio a2 / a1. The terms G and M_star will cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = (G * M_p2² / (K2² * M_star)) / (G * M_p1² / (K1² * M_star))\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / M_p1²) * (K1² / K2²)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n4.  **Determine the Ratios of Mass and Radial Velocity**\n    The ratio of the planet masses is:\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5/7\n\n    The radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ) via the formula K = c * (Δλ / λ_0), where c is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength. Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocities is the same as the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n    K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n5.  **Substitute the Ratios to find a2 / a1**\n    a2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n    Finally, substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
