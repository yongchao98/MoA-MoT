    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, compound 4.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   **Reaction of the dibromo compound:** The compound 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two -CHBr₂ groups on adjacent sp³ carbons (C5 and C6) of a cyclohexadiene ring. Treatment with sodium iodide, a standard reagent for dehalogenation, will cause an elimination reaction. Analogous to the reaction of 1,1,4,4-tetrabromobutane with NaI to form 1,3-butadiene, the two adjacent gem-dibromomethyl groups will eliminate four bromine atoms to form a conjugated diene system. This reaction generates the highly reactive diene, 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene, *in situ*.\n*   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene acts as the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction, while the double bonds of 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative) act as the dienophile. Since two equivalents of the dibromo compound are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, with one molecule of the generated diene adding to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene. This forms a complex polycyclic molecule, **product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a standard acidic deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OC(CH₃)₃) at the 7-position of the central bicyclic core is cleaved to form a hydroxyl group (-OH). Thus, **product 2** is the corresponding alcohol.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Transformation:** This set of reagents is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method to oxidize secondary alcohols to ketones. The secondary alcohol at the 7-position is oxidized to a ketone (C=O). **Product 3** is therefore the ketone corresponding to alcohol 2.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Transformation:** Heating Diels-Alder adducts often initiates a reverse reaction, known as a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. In this case, the complex structure of product 3 will break apart. Since it was formed from two Diels-Alder reactions, it undergoes a double retro-Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **Products of retro-Diels-Alder:** The reaction regenerates the diene and the dienophile core.\n    *   Two molecules of the diene, **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**, are formed.\n    *   The central core, now oxidized, is released as **7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene**. This molecule is known to be unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, losing a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.\n*   **Identifying Product 4:** The final reaction mixture contains benzene, carbon monoxide, and two molecules of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on the \"final product 4.\" Benzene has only one type of hydrogen, which is not among the options. This strongly implies that product 4 is the other major organic product, **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n\n**Analysis of the Structure of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene, we must consider its symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a six-membered cyclohexadiene ring which is not planar; it typically adopts a twisted half-chair conformation. It has double bonds at positions 1 and 3 within the ring and two exocyclic double bonds (=CH₂) at positions 5 and 6.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry, which passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 single bonds.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4 due to the C₂ rotation. This constitutes one set of hydrogens (2H).\n    2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. This is the second set (2H).\n    3.  The two methylidene (=CH₂) groups at C5 and C6 are equivalent by the C₂ rotation.\n    4.  However, within each methylidene group, the two hydrogens are not equivalent. Due to the non-planar nature of the ring, one hydrogen is in a chemically different environment from the other (they are diastereotopic). Let's call them H_endo and H_exo.\n    5.  The H_endo on C5 is equivalent to the H_endo on C6 (by C₂ rotation). This forms the third set of hydrogens (2H).\n    6.  The H_exo on C5 is equivalent to the H_exo on C6 (by C₂ rotation). This forms the fourth set of hydrogens (2H).\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **4** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
