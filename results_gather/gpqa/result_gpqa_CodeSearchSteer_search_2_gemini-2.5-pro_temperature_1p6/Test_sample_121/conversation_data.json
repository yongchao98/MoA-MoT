    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n### Step-by-step Synthesis\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   This is an alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) under acidic catalysis.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃). The hydrogens on the central carbon are now acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt).\n\n4.  **Product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   Because excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon is also removed, creating a second enolate.\n    *   This new nucleophilic center then performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion.\n    *   This cyclization reaction forms a ring. The ring contains the α-carbon from the ethyl cyanoacetate and the five carbons from the dibromopentane chain, resulting in a **six-membered ring**.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe structure of product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n          CN\n          |\n       EtOOC--C(1)\n          / \\\n       H₂C(6) H₂C(2)\n       |      |\n       H₂C(5) H₂C(3)\n        \\   /\n         CH₂(4)\n```\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   The two substituents on C1, cyano (-CN) and ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃), are different.\n*   In principle, this lack of identical substituents on C1 removes any plane of symmetry in a fixed conformation.\n*   However, in solution at room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion, and there is free rotation around the C1-COOEt bond. In the context of many NMR problems, this time-averaging effect establishes an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the carboxylate group.\n\nAssuming this effective plane of symmetry:\n\n*   **Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the CH₂ group at C2 equivalent to the CH₂ group at C6.\n    *   Similarly, the CH₂ group at C3 is equivalent to the CH₂ group at C5.\n    *   The CH₂ group at C4 is unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry.\n    *   This gives us three distinct sets of methylene groups on the ring: (C2/C6), (C3/C5), and C4.\n    *   Now, we must consider the protons within each methylene group. In a cyclohexane chair, each CH₂ has an axial (ax) and an equatorial (eq) proton. These two protons are in different chemical environments (they are diastereotopic). The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct hydrogens*, so we must count them separately.\n        *   **C2/C6 protons:** The axial protons at C2 and C6 are equivalent. The equatorial protons at C2 and C6 are equivalent. However, the axial and equatorial protons are non-equivalent. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **C3/C5 protons:** For the same reason, the axial and equatorial protons are distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **C4 protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are also in different environments and are thus non-equivalent (diastereotopic). This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   Total signals from the ring protons = 2 + 2 + 2 = **6 signals**.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃) Protons:**\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** The two protons of the methylene group. Because of the effective plane of symmetry in the molecule, these two protons are enantiotopic, making them chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. They will appear as a single signal (a quartet due to splitting by the methyl group). This gives **1 distinct signal**.\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will appear as a single signal (a triplet). This gives **1 distinct signal**.\n    *   Total signals from the ethyl group = 1 + 1 = **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ring and the ethyl group: 6 (ring) + 2 (ethyl) = 8.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\nFinal answer is 8.\n\n<<<A>>>"
