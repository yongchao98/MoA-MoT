    "Here is a breakdown of the reagents required for each reaction:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The process involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This reaction typically requires an acidic environment to proceed efficiently. While using hydrogen cyanide (HCN) directly is possible, it is a highly toxic gas. A common and safer laboratory method involves generating HCN in the reaction mixture by adding a strong acid to a cyanide salt like sodium cyanide (NaCN). The acid protonates the oxygen of the intermediate alkoxide, or in some mechanisms, it protonates the carbonyl oxygen, which makes the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and susceptible to attack by the cyanide ion. Therefore, a source of H₃O⁺ (representing a strong acid) is the suitable reagent for A.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (–C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (–COOH). This transformation can be achieved under either acidic or basic conditions, but it generally requires heating. The hydrolysis of a nitrile with just water is extremely slow. For acidic hydrolysis, a strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is heated with the nitrile. Weak acids like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) are generally not effective for this conversion. In this reaction, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid, making a strong acid like HCl the appropriate choice for reagent B.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A** must be an acid to facilitate cyanohydrin formation, making **H₃O⁺** the correct choice.\n*   **B** must be a strong acid to hydrolyze the nitrile, making **HCl** the correct choice.\n\nThus, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
