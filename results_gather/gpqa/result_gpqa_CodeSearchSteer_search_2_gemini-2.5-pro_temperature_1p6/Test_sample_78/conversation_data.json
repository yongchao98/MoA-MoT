    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra\n\nFirst, let's determine the structure of the product formed after the reaction.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:** The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is highly characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in a **ketone**. The other signals are in the aromatic/vinylic region (δ 126-145 ppm) and the aliphatic region (δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm).\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**: These are two distinct methyl groups that are singlets, meaning they have no adjacent protons.\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**: This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**: These two doublets, each for one proton, suggest a disubstituted **carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-)**. The large difference in their chemical shifts suggests they are part of a conjugated system.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    *   The para-substituted ring and one methyl singlet (e.g., δ 2.28, ¹³C at 21.3 ppm) suggest a **p-tolyl group** (a toluene ring substituted at the para position).\n    *   The other methyl singlet (δ 2.31, ¹³C at 28.4 ppm) and the ketone group suggest an **acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃)**. The chemical shift of the acetyl methyl carbon is typically around 25-30 ppm.\n    *   Connecting these pieces with the -CH=CH- group gives the structure: **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n    Let's verify this structure with the NMR data:\n    *   `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n    *   **¹H NMR**: p-tolyl-CH₃ (s), acetyl-CH₃ (s), two aromatic protons (d), two other aromatic protons (d), two vinylic protons (d). This perfectly matches the observed signals.\n    *   **¹³C NMR**: p-tolyl CH₃ (21.3), acetyl CH₃ (28.4), ketone C=O (197.7), and the required number of aromatic and vinylic carbons. This also fits perfectly.\n    *   **Molecular Formula**: C₁₁H₁₂O. This matches the starting material.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Reactants\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An isomerisation of Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) to 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one, catalyzed by DABCO (a non-nucleophilic base) at high temperature. The options provided for X are all epoxides. This points to a rearrangement of an epoxide to a ketone.\n*   **The Reactants (Compound X options):**\n    *   A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n    *   B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`. The full structure is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This contains a p-tolyl group and the correct number of carbons to form the product's backbone.\n    *   C) 2-styrylepoxide: Formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which is incorrect. It also has a phenyl group.\n    *   D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n\n### Step 3: Match Reactant to Product and Confirm the Reaction\n\nBased on the carbon skeleton, **only Compound B has the p-tolyl group** that is present in the final product. The other options have phenyl groups and would not form a p-tolyl substituted product.\n\nThe reaction is the rearrangement of 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane to 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n`p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂` (Compound X) → `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃` (Product)\n\nThis specific transformation of a terminal vinyl epoxide into a methyl ketone is a known process. Literature confirms that DABCO is used as a catalyst for the Meinwald rearrangement of terminal epoxides to specifically yield methyl ketones, often under thermal conditions similar to those described in the problem.\n\nTherefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
