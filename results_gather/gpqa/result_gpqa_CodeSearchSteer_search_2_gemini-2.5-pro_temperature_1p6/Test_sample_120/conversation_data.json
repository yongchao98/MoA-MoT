    "To determine the product of the reaction between (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), we must consider the regiochemistry and stereochemistry of the epoxide ring-opening.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This name describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with the specified R/S configuration at each stereocenter.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi, known as a Gilman reagent or organocuprate, is a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃⁻).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   Organocuprates react with epoxides via an Sₙ2-type mechanism. The search results confirm that epoxide opening with organocuprates is highly selective and involves two key principles.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The attack occurs from the backside of the C-O bond, leading to an inversion of configuration at the carbon that is attacked.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substrate and Site of Attack:**\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed between C1 and C6 of the bicycloheptane structure.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon center.\n    *   C6 has no substituents other than being part of the ring, making it a secondary carbon center.\n    *   According to the principle of regioselectivity, the nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack the less hindered carbon, which is C6.\n\n4.  **Predict the Product's Structure and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The methyl nucleophile adds to C6. The bond between C6 and the epoxide oxygen breaks.\n    *   **Ring Opening:** The bond between C1 and the epoxide oxygen also breaks, and upon acidic workup (which is implicit in these reactions), the oxygen is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n    *   **Resulting Skeleton:** The reaction opens the bicyclic system to form a substituted cyclohexanol. The original methyl group at C1 and the new hydroxyl group are on the same carbon. A new methyl group (from the cuprate) is now attached to the adjacent carbon (the original C6). The methyl groups at C3 and C4 remain in their positions on the ring.\n    *   **Nomenclature of the Product:** Following IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. Therefore, the product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern.\n    *   **Stereochemical outcome:**\n        *   **At C1:** The configuration was initially (R). Since no bonds at this chiral center are broken (the C-O bond cleavage does not affect the substituents' arrangement), its configuration is retained. The new C1 remains (R).\n        *   **At C3 and C4:** These stereocenters are not involved in the reaction. Their original configurations, (3R) and (4R) respectively, are retained. In the re-numbered product, these become C4 and C5, so their configurations are (4R) and (5R).\n        *   **At C6:** The configuration was initially (S). This carbon is the site of the Sₙ2 attack. Therefore, its configuration is inverted. An (S) center becomes an (R) center. In the re-numbered product, this is C2. Thus, the new configuration at C2 is (R).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The resulting product has the substitution pattern of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n    *   The stereochemistry is (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\nFinal Answer: The final product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n<<<C>>>"
