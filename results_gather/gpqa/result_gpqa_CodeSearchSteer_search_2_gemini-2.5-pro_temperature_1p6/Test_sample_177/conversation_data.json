    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density\n\nIn quantum field theory, the action *S* must be dimensionless in natural units (where ħ = c = 1). The action is defined as the four-dimensional integral of the Lagrangian density, L:\n\n*S* = ∫d⁴x L\n\nThe mass dimension of the four-volume element d⁴x is -4, since each spacetime coordinate has a mass dimension of -1. For *S* to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density L must have a mass dimension of +4.\n\n[L] = 4\n\n### 2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields and Tensors\n\nWe determine the mass dimension of each component of the interaction term `κ ψ̄ σ_μν ψ F^μν` by examining their respective kinetic terms in a standard Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Fermion Field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is `ψ̄(iγ^μ∂_μ)ψ`. Since `[∂_μ] = 1` and `[L] = 4`, we have:\n    [ψ̄] + [∂_μ] + [ψ] = 4\n    2[ψ] + 1 = 4\n    [ψ] = 3/2\n    So, the mass dimension of the fermion field `ψ` (and its Dirac adjoint `ψ̄`) is 3/2.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor (F^μν):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `-(1/4)F_μν F^μν`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have:\n    2[F^μν] = 4\n    [F^μν] = 2\n\n*   **Sigma Tensor (σ_μν):** The tensor `σ_μν` is defined as `(i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. The gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless matrices. Therefore, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless.\n    [σ_μν] = 0\n\n### 3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant (κ)\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian term `L_int` must have a mass dimension of 4. We can now write the dimensional equation for the given interaction:\n\n[L_int] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ_μν] + [ψ] + [F^μν] = 4\n\nSubstituting the known dimensions:\n\n[κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 4\n[κ] + 3 + 2 = 4\n[κ] + 5 = 4\n[κ] = -1\n\nTherefore, the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ is -1.\n\n### 4. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension, the theory is renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, the theory is not renormalizable. In non-renormalizable theories, new, more severe divergences appear at higher orders of perturbation theory, requiring an infinite number of counter-terms and thus stripping the theory of its predictive power at high energies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is non-renormalizable. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
