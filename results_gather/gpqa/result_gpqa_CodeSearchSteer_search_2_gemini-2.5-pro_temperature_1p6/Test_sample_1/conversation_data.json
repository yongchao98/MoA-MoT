    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in product 3.\n\n**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide → product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   *trans*-cinnamaldehyde has the chemical formula C₉H₈O. It consists of a benzene ring attached to an unsaturated aldehyde, giving it a total of 9 carbon atoms.\n    *   Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr) is a Grignard reagent, which will add a methyl group (CH₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Grignard reaction. The nucleophilic methyl group from the Grignard reagent attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. Subsequent workup with acid protonates the oxygen, forming a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** The resulting product is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The 9 carbons from cinnamaldehyde plus the 1 carbon from the methyl group result in a total of **10 carbon atoms** in product 1.\n\n**Step 2: product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) → product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol, is a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is an oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols into ketones.\n*   **Reaction:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) in product 1 is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n*   **Product 2:** The product is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Carbon Count:** This oxidation reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms. Therefore, product 2 also has **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: product 2 + (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane → product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** (Dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane is more commonly known as dimethylsulfoxonium methylide or the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent. This sulfur ylide is used to add a methylene (CH₂) group.\n*   **Reaction:** In the Corey-Chaykovsky reaction, when dimethylsulfoxonium methylide reacts with an α,β-unsaturated ketone, it typically leads to the cyclopropanation of the double bond. However, the less stable dimethylsulfonium methylide would form an epoxide at the carbonyl group. Assuming the intended reaction from the reagent name is epoxide formation (a common introductory organic chemistry problem), the ylide attacks the carbonyl carbon to form an epoxide. The reaction with an α,β-unsaturated ketone adds the methylene (CH₂) group from the ylide to the carbonyl carbon, forming an epoxide ring.\n*   **Product 3:** The product formed is 2-methyl-2-((E)-styryl)oxirane.\n*   **Carbon Count:** Product 2 had 10 carbons. The Corey-Chaykovsky reaction adds one carbon atom from the methylene group of the ylide. Therefore, product 3 has 10 + 1 = **11 carbon atoms**.\n\nFinal count:\n*   trans-cinnamaldehyde: 9 carbons\n*   Product 1: 9 + 1 = 10 carbons\n*   Product 2: 10 carbons\n*   Product 3: 10 + 1 = 11 carbons\n\nThus, product 3 contains 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
