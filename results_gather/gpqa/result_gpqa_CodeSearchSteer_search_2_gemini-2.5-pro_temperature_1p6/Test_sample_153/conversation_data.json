    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unidentified white solid.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** A second peak is observed at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32%. The M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl ratio).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the O-H stretch, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. Its integration as 1H confirms one such proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The two sets of protons are chemically non-equivalent but symmetrical, splitting each other into doublets.\n\n### Conclusion based on Spectral Data\nThe combined data points to a molecule with a molecular weight of 156, containing one chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight and functional group, the *ortho* substitution would result in a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule fits all the data perfectly. It has a molecular weight of 156.57 g/mol. It contains a carboxylic acid, which matches the IR data. It is a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which perfectly explains the ¹H NMR spectrum showing two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the carboxylic acid proton.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule lacks a carboxylic acid group (and its acidic proton), which contradicts both the IR and ¹H NMR data.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule has aldehyde and phenol groups, not a carboxylic acid. Its ¹H NMR spectrum would be significantly different, featuring an aldehyde proton signal (around 9-10 ppm) and a more complex aromatic pattern for three protons.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable structure that matches all the provided spectral information is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
