    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound E:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Compound A.**\n\n*   **Hint a)** states that Compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide in a Wittig reaction to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. In a Wittig reaction, a carbonyl group (C=O) is converted into a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The structure of the product reveals the carbon skeleton of the initial ketone. The \"propan-2-ylidene\" part comes from the ylide, meaning Compound A must be 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one.\n*   **Hint b)** provides infrared (IR) spectroscopy data. It states that Compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm⁻¹. This absorption frequency is characteristic of the C=O stretch in a five-membered ring ketone (cyclopentanone), which is more strained than an open-chain or six-membered ring ketone. This confirms that Compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative.\n\n**Step 2: Trace the reaction sequence.**\n\n1.  **Compound A to B:** 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one (A) reacts with hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon to form a cyanohydrin, which is 1-cyano-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol (B).\n\n2.  **Compound B to C:** The cyanohydrin (B) is reduced with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the nitrile group (-CN) to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂), yielding 1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol (C).\n\n3.  **Compound C to D:** Compound C, a primary amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂). Primary amines react with nitrous acid to form unstable diazonium salts. In this case, it forms the (1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-yl)methanediazonium salt (D).\n\n4.  **Compound D to E:** The diazonium salt (D) is unstable and spontaneously decomposes. It eliminates an inert gas, which is molecular nitrogen (N₂), to form a highly reactive primary carbocation. This intermediate then undergoes a ring expansion rearrangement known as the **Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement**. In this reaction, a C-C bond from the cyclopentane ring migrates to the adjacent carbocation, expanding the five-membered ring into a more stable six-membered ring and forming a new ketone.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the structure of Compound E and verify with evidence.**\n\n*   The Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement of 1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol results in the formation of a dimethyl-substituted cyclohexanone. Tracing the migration of the carbon atoms shows that the resulting product is **3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one (E)**.\n*   **Hint b)** states that Compound E has a strong IR peak around 1715 cm⁻¹. This value is characteristic for the carbonyl stretch of a six-membered ring ketone (cyclohexanone). This confirms the ring expansion from a five-membered ring (A, ~1750 cm⁻¹) to a six-membered ring (E, ~1715 cm⁻¹).\n\nBased on the reaction sequence and spectroscopic evidence, Compound E is 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
