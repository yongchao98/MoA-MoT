    "Based on the provided ¹H NMR data and established principles of NMR spectroscopy, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data:\n\n1.  **Chemical Shift and Integration:**\n    *   The data shows four distinct signals with proton integrations of 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H, for a total of 8 protons.\n    *   Propenyl acetate (CH₃CH=CHOC(O)CH₃) has 8 protons, consistent with the data. Butenyl acetate would have 10 protons, which eliminates options C and D.\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This singlet with an integration of 3 protons is characteristic of the methyl group on an acetate (–C(O)CH₃). It is a singlet because it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This doublet, integrating to 3 protons, corresponds to the methyl group (CH₃–) attached to the double bond. It is split into a doublet by the single proton on the adjacent vinyl carbon.\n\n2.  **Vinyl Protons and Coupling Constant:**\n    *   The two remaining protons at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm are the vinyl protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (–CH=CH–).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is for one of the vinyl protons. The significant downfield shift to 7.0 ppm is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom. The splitting pattern is a doublet (d), indicating it is coupled to only one other proton, the other vinyl proton.\n    *   **The Coupling Constant (J):** The most critical piece of information for determining the stereochemistry is the coupling constant, J = 16.0 Hz. For protons across a double bond:\n        *   A *trans* coupling constant (J_trans_) is typically in the range of 11-18 Hz.\n        *   A *cis* coupling constant (J_cis_) is typically in the range of 6-14 Hz.\n    *   The observed value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely in the *trans* range, confirming a trans configuration of the double bond.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal corresponds to the other vinyl proton. It is split into a doublet (d) by the first vinyl proton (with J = 16.0 Hz) and into a quartet (q) by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group. This splitting pattern is called a doublet of quartets (dq).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe integration confirms the compound is a propenyl acetate. The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) of the vinyl protons unequivocally indicates a *trans* stereochemistry. All other signals are consistent with the structure of trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
