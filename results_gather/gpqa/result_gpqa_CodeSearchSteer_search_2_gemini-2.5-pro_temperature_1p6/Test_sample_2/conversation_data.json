    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expectation value of the operator `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x` for the given quantum state `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩`.\n\nThe expectation value, denoted as `⟨O⟩`, is given by the formula:\n`⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`\n\nSubstituting the operator `O`, we get:\n`⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ⟩`\n\nDue to the linearity of the inner product, this can be split into two parts:\n`⟨O⟩ = 10⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ + 5⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩`\n\nHere, `⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩` and `⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩` are the expectation values of the Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x` respectively. Let's calculate them one by one.\n\n**1. Calculation of ⟨σ_z⟩**\n\nThe operator `σ_z` acts on the eigenstates `|↑⟩` and `|↓⟩` as follows:\n*   `σ_z|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩`\n*   `σ_z|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩`\n\nSo, `σ_z|ψ⟩ = σ_z(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩) = 0.5(σ_z|↑⟩) + (√3/2)(σ_z|↓⟩) = 0.5|↑⟩ - (√3/2)|↓⟩`.\n\nNow, we calculate `⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩`:\n`⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|) * (0.5|↑⟩ - (√3/2)|↓⟩)`\n\nUsing the orthonormality of the basis states (`⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1`, `⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1`, `⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0`, `⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0`):\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)(0.5)⟨↑|↑⟩ - (√3/2)(√3/2)⟨↓|↓⟩ = (0.5)² - (√3/2)²`\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n**2. Calculation of ⟨σ_x⟩**\n\nThe operator `σ_x` acts on the eigenstates `|↑⟩` and `|↓⟩` as follows:\n*   `σ_x|↑⟩ = |↓⟩`\n*   `σ_x|↓⟩ = |↑⟩`\n\nSo, `σ_x|ψ⟩ = σ_x(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩) = 0.5(σ_x|↑⟩) + (√3/2)(σ_x|↓⟩) = 0.5|↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩`.\n\nNow, we calculate `⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩`:\n`⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|) * ((√3/2)|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩)`\n\nUsing the orthonormality relations again:\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5)(√3/2)⟨↑|↑⟩ + (√3/2)(0.5)⟨↓|↓⟩ = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nNow we substitute the expectation values of `σ_z` and `σ_x` back into the expression for `⟨O⟩`:\n`⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩`\n`⟨O⟩ = 10(-0.5) + 5(√3/2)`\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + (5√3)/2`\n\nUsing the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + (5 * 1.732) / 2`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 8.66 / 2`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding the result to one decimal place, we get -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
