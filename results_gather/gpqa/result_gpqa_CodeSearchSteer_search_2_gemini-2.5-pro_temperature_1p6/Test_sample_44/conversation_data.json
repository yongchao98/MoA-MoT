    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels are given by:\n*   E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)\nwhere n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E as:\n*   E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)\n\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n*   **E_n = n^2 * E**\n*   E_1 = 1²E = 1E\n*   E_2 = 2²E = 4E\n*   E_3 = 3²E = 9E\n*   E_4 = 4²E = 16E\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2. Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are identical spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level (n) and the spin state (spin-up, ↑, or spin-down, ↓). Consequently, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Total Energies\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n#### Ground State Energy\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   Two particles go into the n=1 level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   The remaining two particles go into the n=2 level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total ground state energy (E_ground) is:\nE_ground = 2 × E₁ + 2 × E₂\nE_ground = 2 × (1E) + 2 × (4E)\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n#### First Excited State Energy\nThe first excited state is the lowest possible energy configuration above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   Two particles remain in the n=1 level.\n*   One particle remains in the n=2 level.\n*   One particle is excited to the n=3 level.\n\nThe total first excited state energy (E_first_excited) is:\nE_first_excited = 2 × E₁ + 1 × E₂ + 1 × E₃\nE_first_excited = 2 × (1E) + 1 × (4E) + 1 × (9E)\nE_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy. We must consider the different ways to create an excitation from the ground state that has more energy than the first excited state.\n\n*   **Possibility 1:** Excite one particle from the n=2 level to the n=4 level.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E\n\n*   **Possibility 2:** Excite both particles from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E\n\n*   **Possibility 3:** Excite one particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**\n\nComparing the energies (22E, 20E, 18E), the lowest energy above the first excited state is 18E. This is the energy of the second excited state.\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
