    "The potentials for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They account for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at the finite speed of light, `c`. This means the field observed at a point `r` at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`.\n\nThe expressions for the scalar potential `V` and the vector potential `A` are derived from Maxwell's equations. For a point charge `q` with velocity `v` at the retarded position, the scalar potential is given by:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{1}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\nThis can be rewritten by factoring out `c` from the denominator:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe vector potential `A` is similarly given by:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}$\n\nThis can also be rewritten as:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions precisely match option B. The term `(dc - d⋅v)` in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they use the simple Coulomb potential, `V = q / (4πε₀r)`, which is only valid for a stationary charge.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it has a `+` sign in the denominator. This corresponds to the \"advanced\" potentials, which would imply that the effect precedes the cause, violating causality. The physically correct \"retarded\" potentials use a `-` sign.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
