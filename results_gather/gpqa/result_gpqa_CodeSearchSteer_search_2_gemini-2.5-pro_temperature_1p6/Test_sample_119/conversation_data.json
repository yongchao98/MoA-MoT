    "The initial theoretical derivation concluded that the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars per unit volume is constant everywhere. Let's call this constant density `ρ`.\n2.  **Volume and Distance:** The number of stars `N` within a certain distance `d` is the volume of a sphere with radius `d` multiplied by the star density `ρ`.\n    *   `N(d) = ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3`\n3.  **Parallax and Distance:** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance `d`.\n    *   `d = 1 / plx`\n4.  **Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax:** By substituting the distance `d` in the first equation, we can find the total number of stars with a parallax greater than a certain value `plx` (which corresponds to all stars closer than distance `d`).\n    *   `N(>plx) = ρ * (4/3) * π * (1 / plx)^3`\n5.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax Range:** The question asks how the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* changes. This quantity, let's call it `n(plx)`, is the derivative of the total number of stars `N` with respect to parallax `plx`. We need to calculate `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ ρ * (4/3) * π * plx^(-3) ]`\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = ρ * (4/3) * π * (-3) * plx^(-4)`\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = -4 * ρ * π * plx^(-4)`\n6.  **The Result:** The negative sign simply indicates that as parallax increases (meaning the stars are closer), the cumulative number of stars decreases. If we consider the density of stars at a particular parallax value, we are interested in the magnitude. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `plx^(-4)` or `1/plx^4`. This relationship is noted in discussions of the Lutz-Kelker bias, which addresses systematic errors in parallax measurements arising from this underlying distribution.\n\nThus, for a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
