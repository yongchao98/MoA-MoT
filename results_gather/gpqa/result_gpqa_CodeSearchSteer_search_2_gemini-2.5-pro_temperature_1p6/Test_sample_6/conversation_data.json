    "To determine the energy threshold at which high-energy gamma-rays have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we analyze the kinematics of the pair production process:\nγ (high-energy) + γ (CMB) → e⁻ + e⁺\n\nThe threshold energy for this reaction is the minimum energy required for the high-energy gamma-ray (Eγ) to create an electron-positron pair when colliding with a CMB photon (E_CMB). This minimum energy corresponds to the case where the electron and positron are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame of the two colliding photons.\n\nFor a head-on collision, which requires the minimum energy for the incident gamma-ray, the threshold energy can be calculated using the conservation of four-momentum. The invariant mass squared (s) is the same in the lab frame and the center-of-mass frame. At the threshold, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, which is 2 * mₑc².\n\nThe formula derived from these principles is:\n\n**E_γ = (mₑc²)² / E_CMB**\n\nWhere:\n*   **E_γ** is the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   **mₑc²** is the rest mass energy of an electron.\n*   **E_CMB** is the energy of the CMB photon.\n\nThe necessary values are:\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron (mₑc²) is approximately 0.511 MeV, which is 5.11 x 10⁵ eV.\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon (E_CMB) is given as 10⁻³ eV.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\nE_γ = (5.11 x 10⁵ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)\nE_γ = (2.61121 x 10¹¹ eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)\nE_γ = 2.61121 x 10¹⁴ eV\n\nThe question asks for the answer in Giga-electron Volts (GeV), so we convert our result from eV to GeV (1 GeV = 10⁹ eV):\n\nE_γ = (2.61121 x 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)\nE_γ = 2.61121 x 10⁵ GeV\n\nThis value is approximately 2.6 x 10⁵ GeV.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.6 * 10⁵ GeV\nB) 3.9 * 10⁵ GeV\nC) 9.5 * 10⁴ GeV\nD) 1.8 * 10⁵ GeV\n\nThe calculated threshold energy matches option A. High-energy gamma rays with energies above this threshold will have their mean free path and, consequently, their lifetimes in the universe significantly limited by this pair production process with CMB photons.\n\n<<<A>>>"
