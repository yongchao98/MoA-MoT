    "Here is a step-by-by-step derivation of the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.\n\n1.  **Define the frames of reference and velocities:**\n    *   Let the laboratory be the stationary frame of reference (S).\n    *   Let the moving glass be the moving frame of reference (S').\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass, as measured in the glass's own frame of reference (S'), is `u'`. This speed is determined by the refractive index `n` of the glass. The speed of light in a material with a refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, we have `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   We want to find `u`, the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S).\n\n2.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    For velocities in the same direction, Einstein's velocity addition formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n3.  **Substitute the given values into the formula:**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n4.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    To simplify the fraction, find a common denominator for both the numerator and the denominator, which is `n`:\n    *   Numerator: `1/n + v = (1 + n*v) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n\n    Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n    `u = ((1 + n*v) / n) / ((n + v) / n)`\n\n    The `n` in the denominators cancels out, leaving:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result is a direct consequence of the principles of special relativity. The phenomenon, where the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple sum of the speed in the medium and the medium's velocity, was first observed in the Fizeau experiment in 1851 and later explained by Einstein's theory.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nB) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nC) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated speed matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
