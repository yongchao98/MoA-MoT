    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the correct reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH)\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Donor:** The enolate of dimethyl malonate. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of dimethyl malonate.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n*   **Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. Subsequent protonation of the resulting enolate intermediate by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent yields the final product.\n*   **Product A:** The nucleophilic carbon from dimethyl malonate (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`) attaches to the β-carbon of the acrylate (the carbon atom bonded to the p-tolyl group). The α-carbon of the acrylate is then protonated.\n    *   The resulting structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOCH₃`.\n    *   This corresponds to the name **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+)\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael addition, followed by hydrolysis.\n*   **Michael Donor:** The enamine, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The α-carbon of the enamine (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) is the nucleophilic center.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. An iminium ion intermediate is formed. Subsequent hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O+) converts the iminium group back into a ketone.\n*   **Product B:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2). The substituent is derived from but-2-enenitrile and is a `-(CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)` group.\n    *   The systematic name for this product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, more stable tautomer.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we must identify the starting Michael donor (C).\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Mechanism (Retrosynthesis):** The product is formed by creating a bond between the nucleophile C and the β-carbon of MVK. The substituent on the product ring is a `-(CH₂CH₂C(=O)CH₃)` group, which is the structure of MVK after the addition. This group is attached to C2 of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione, formed by deprotonation at the highly acidic C2 position.\n*   **Reactant C:** The starting material that forms this enolate is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination of reactants and products matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
