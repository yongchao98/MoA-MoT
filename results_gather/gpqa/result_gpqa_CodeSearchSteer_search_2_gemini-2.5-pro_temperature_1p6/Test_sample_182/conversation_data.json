    "Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and Reagents\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group, which by convention is at position 1.\n    *   `2-formyl`: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position 2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very strong reducing agent.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula and IHD of the Reactant\n\nFirst, let's determine the molecular formula for the reactant to understand its initial degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   6 in the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   1 in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n    *   **Total C = 10**\n*   **Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    *   Ring: 1 on C1, 1 on C2, 1 on C3, 1 on C4, 1 on C5, 2 on C6 = 7 hydrogens.\n    *   Carboxylic acid: 1 H.\n    *   Formyl group: 1 H.\n    *   Vinyl group: 3 H.\n    *   **Total H = 12**\n*   **Oxygen atoms (O):**\n    *   2 in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   1 in the formyl group.\n    *   **Total O = 3**\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as degrees of unsaturation, can be calculated using the formula: IHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n\nIHD (reactant) = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 ring\n*   1 C=C bond in the ring\n*   1 C=C bond in the vinyl group\n*   1 C=O bond in the formyl group\n*   1 C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group\n\n### Step 3: Predict the Product of the Reaction\n\nThe reaction with excess HI and red phosphorus is a powerful reduction that converts many oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds into saturated hydrocarbons.\n\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** in the vinyl group will be reduced to a single bond, converting it to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** within the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond, saturating the ring to a **cyclohexane** structure.\n\nThe final product will be a cyclohexane ring with three substituents: a methyl group at position 1, another methyl group at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 5. The name of the product is **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Molecular Formula and IHD of the Product\n\nNow, let's find the molecular formula of the product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   6 in the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   1 in the methyl group at C1.\n    *   1 in the methyl group at C2.\n    *   2 in the ethyl group at C5.\n    *   **Total C = 10**\n*   **Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    *   The general formula for a substituted cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   For C₁₀, the formula will be C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\nFinally, we calculate the IHD for the product.\n\nIHD (product) = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThis single degree of unsaturation corresponds to the presence of the cyclohexane ring in the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
