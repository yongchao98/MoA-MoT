    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we first need to calculate its mole fraction.\n\nThe formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes can be described by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺,         β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂],       β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻,      β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻,    β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of all cobalt-containing species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nBy substituting the expressions for each complex concentration using the stability constants, we get:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe mole fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is the concentration of that species divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species. This can be calculated with the formula:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nGiven the concentrations:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   c(Co) = 10⁻² M\n\nSince the thiocyanate concentration is ten times higher than the total cobalt concentration, we can assume that the concentration of free thiocyanate at equilibrium is approximately 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can calculate the terms in the formula:\n*   1 = 1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNext, we sum the terms in the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe term for the dithiocyanato complex in the numerator is β₂[SCN⁻]², which is 0.4.\n\nFinally, we calculate the mole fraction (α₂):\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThus, the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
