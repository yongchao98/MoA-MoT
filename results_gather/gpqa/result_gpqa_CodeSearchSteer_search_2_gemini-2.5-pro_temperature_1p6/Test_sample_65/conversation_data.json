    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators constructed from SM fields. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian adheres to certain fundamental symmetry principles.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SMEFT is formulated as a local quantum field theory that is consistent with the principles of special relativity. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations).\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry**: This is a broader spacetime symmetry that includes Lorentz symmetry as well as spacetime translations. The SMEFT Lagrangian is constructed to be invariant under the Poincaré group.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model. A primary motivation for the SMEFT is to provide a model-independent way to parameterize potential new sources of CP violation from physics beyond the Standard Model. Consequently, the SMEFT contains operators that are CP-violating, and it does not require all operators to respect CP symmetry.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: According to the CPT theorem, any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT invariant. Since the SMEFT is built upon these principles, its operators must respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\nBased on these points, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
