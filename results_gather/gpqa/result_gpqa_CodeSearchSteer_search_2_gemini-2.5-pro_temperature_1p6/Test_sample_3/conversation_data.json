    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles—isolated north or south magnetic poles—exist, two of the fundamental equations of electromagnetism as we know them, Maxwell's equations, would require modification.\n\nThe standard form of Maxwell's equations does not account for magnetic charges. Specifically, Gauss's law for magnetism states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇ · **B** = 0), which mathematically implies the absence of magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles were to exist, they would act as sources for the magnetic field, similar to how electric charges are sources for the electric field. Consequently, Gauss's law for magnetism would be altered to include a term for magnetic charge density (ρₘ), taking a form like ∇ · **B** = ρₘ.\n\nFurthermore, the existence of moving magnetic charges would constitute a magnetic current (Jₘ). This would necessitate a change in Faraday's law of induction. In its standard form, Faraday's law relates a changing magnetic field to the circulation of the electric field (∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t). To account for magnetic currents, a new term would be added, modifying the equation to something akin to ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t - Jₘ. This change reflects that a magnetic current would also produce a circulating electric field.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<C>>>"
