    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z**:\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. We can use this to determine the empirical formula.\n    *   Mass % of H = (Atomic mass of H × y) / (Molecular Mass of CxHy) × 100\n    *   0.1428 ≈ (1 × y) / (12 × x + 1 × y)\n    *   This gives a ratio of y/x ≈ 2. So the empirical formula is CH2.\n    *   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n, which has an empirical formula of CH2.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a cycloalkane CnH2n is (2n × 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which matches the given value of 14.28%.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. This is consistent with Z being a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y**:\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by treating X with heated platinum. It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   One of the liquids in Y is substance Z (the cycloalkane, CnH2n). Let's call the other liquid Y2.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means both Z and Y2 are saturated or are unreactive towards bromine water (like aromatic compounds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only substance Z.\n    *   This implies that Z remains unchanged upon hydrogenation, and Y2 gets hydrogenated to Z.\n    *   For Y2 to hydrogenate to Z (a cycloalkane, CnH2n), Y2 must be the corresponding aromatic compound (e.g., benzene C6H6 hydrogenates to cyclohexane C6H12). Aromatic compounds do not decolorize bromine water. This fits all the conditions.\n    *   Therefore, Y must be an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (Z = CnH2n) and its corresponding aromatic hydrocarbon (Y2 = CnH2n-6). This requires the ring size n to be at least 6.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Mixture X**:\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is described as a disproportionation, producing an equimolar mixture. This suggests a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are hydrogenated (reduced) and others are dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n    *   The reaction is: X1 + X2 → Z + Y2 (in 1:1 molar ratio)\n    *   Substituting the formulas: X1 + X2 → CnH2n + CnH2n-6.\n    *   Both X1 and X2 decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   Both X1 and X2 are hydrogenated to form only Z (CnH2n). This means they have the same n-carbon cyclic skeleton as Z.\n    *   For the reaction to be balanced via hydrogen transfer, one component of X must donate hydrogen and the other must accept it. A plausible scenario is a reaction between a cycloalkene and a cycloalkadiene.\n    *   Let X1 be a cycloalkene (CnH2n-2) and X2 be a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (CnH2n-4), as the problem states no conjugated bonds.\n    *   The reaction becomes: CnH2n-2 (X1) + CnH2n-4 (X2) → CnH2n (Z) + CnH2n-6 (Y2)\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen balance: The total number of hydrogen atoms on the left is (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6. The total on the right is (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n-6. The reaction is balanced.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**:\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2.\n    *   Total H atoms = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6.\n    *   We need to determine the value of 'n'. The options provided are A) 22, B) 18, C) 12, D) 16. The total number must be an even number, which all options are.\n    *   Let's test plausible values for n (where n≥6):\n        *   If **n=6** (the cyclohexane system): Total H = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = **18**. This corresponds to option B.\n        *   If **n=7** (the methylcyclohexane/toluene system): Total H = 4(7) - 6 = 28 - 6 = **22**. This corresponds to option A. (The initial option labels in the thought process were mismatched with the provided list).\n\n5.  **Final Deduction**:\n    *   For n=6, X would be a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   For n=7, X would be a mixture of methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). The sum of hydrogen atoms is 12 + 10 = 22.\n    *   Both cyclohexane (n=6) and methylcyclohexane (n=7) are widely used solvents. The chemical scenario described is the classic Zelinsky-Kazansky disproportionation, or more precisely, a catalytic hydrogen transfer. The C6 system (cyclohexene to cyclohexane and benzene) is the most fundamental and commonly cited example of this type of reaction in chemistry education. Therefore, it is the most likely intended answer.\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nA) 22\nB) 18\nC) 12\nD) 16\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
