    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal as the starspots, we must first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots.\n\n### 1. Modeling Stellar Brightness\n\nThe brightness or flux (F) from a stellar surface is dictated by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, `F = σT⁴`, where `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and `T` is the effective temperature.\n\nWe can model the star's brightness at two key moments during its rotation:\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk of the star is at the effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K. The total flux is proportional to `T_eff⁴`.\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere has a spot filling factor `f` of 20% (or 0.20). This means 20% of the visible surface is covered by cooler spots, and the remaining 80% is the normal photosphere. The total flux is a combination of the flux from the hotter photosphere and the cooler spots.\n    *   Temperature of spots (T_spot) = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K.\n    *   The flux at this point is proportional to `(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Signal Amplitude from Spots\n\nThe amplitude of the variation due to rotational modulation is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum brightness:\n\nAmplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\nAmplitude_spots = `f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   `f` = 0.20\n*   `T_spot` = 5000 K\n*   `T_eff` = 6000 K\n\nAmplitude_spots = `0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\nAmplitude_spots = `0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\nAmplitude_spots = `0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)`\nAmplitude_spots = `0.20 * (671 / 1296)`\nAmplitude_spots ≈ `0.20 * 0.5177`\nAmplitude_spots ≈ `0.1035`\n\nSo, the star's brightness dips by about 10.35% due to the spotted hemisphere.\n\n### 3. Equating to an Exoplanet Transit\n\nAn exoplanet transiting its star causes a dip in brightness known as the transit depth. This depth is approximately the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n\nAmplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nTo find the exoplanet that mimics the starspot signal, we set the two amplitudes to be equal:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude_spots\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.1035\n\n### 4. Solving for the Planet's Relative Radius\n\nFinally, we take the square root to find the ratio of the planet's radius (R_pl) to the star's radius (R_star):\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.1035\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3217\n\nThis result indicates that a hypothetical exoplanet with a radius of approximately 32% that of its host star would produce a transit signal with the same amplitude as the variation caused by the described starspots.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
