    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Normalization of the state |α>\n\nThe given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let the normalized state be:\n|α> = N * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\n\nFor the state to be normalized, the inner product <α|α> must be equal to 1.\n<α|α> = |N|² * [< (1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] = 1\n|N|² * [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ] = 1\n|N|² * [ (1 - i²) + (4 - i²) ] = 1\n|N|² * [ (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) ] = 1\n|N|² * (2 + 5) = 1\n7|N|² = 1\n|N| = 1/√7\n\nSo, the normalized state is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\n\nIn matrix notation, where |up> =ᵀ and |down> =ᵀ, the state vector is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]ᵀ\n\n### 2. The Operator A and its Eigenstates/Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements: Aᵢⱼ = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. This gives the matrix:\nA = (ħ/2) * [, ]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0:\ndet([ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]) = 0\nλ² - (ħ/2)² = 0\nλ = ± ħ/2\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ₁ = +ħ/2 and λ₂ = -ħ/2.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   For λ₁ = +ħ/2, the eigenvector |a₁> is:\n    A|a₁> = (ħ/2)|a₁>\n    (ħ/2) * [, ] [v₁, v₂]ᵀ = (ħ/2) [v₁, v₂]ᵀ\n    [v₂, v₁]ᵀ = [v₁, v₂]ᵀ => v₁ = v₂.\n    The normalized eigenvector is |a₁> = (1/√2) *ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>).\n\n*   For λ₂ = -ħ/2, the eigenvector |a₂> is:\n    A|a₂> = (-ħ/2)|a₂>\n    (ħ/2) * [, ] [v₁, v₂]ᵀ = (-ħ/2) [v₁, v₂]ᵀ\n    [v₂, v₁]ᵀ = [-v₁, -v₂]ᵀ => v₂ = -v₁.\n    The normalized eigenvector is |a₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the particle in an eigenstate |aᵢ> is given by Pᵢ = |<aᵢ|α>|².\n\n*   **Probability for eigenstate |a₁> (with eigenvalue λ₁ = +ħ/2):**\n    P₁ = |<a₁|α>|²\n    <a₁|α> = [ (1/√2) * (<up| + <down|) ] * [ (1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) ]\n    <a₁|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i) ]\n    <a₁|α> = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14\n    P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428\n\n*   **Probability for eigenstate |a₂> (with eigenvalue λ₂ = -ħ/2):**\n    P₂ = |<a₂|α>|²\n    <a₂|α> = [ (1/√2) * (<up| - <down|) ] * [ (1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) ]\n    <a₂|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1)(1+i) - (1)(2-i) ]\n    <a₂|α> = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14\n    P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²) / 14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Average Value\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is given by <A> = <α|A|α>.\nAn alternative way is to use the probabilities and eigenvalues:\n<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂\n<A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)\n<A> = (ħ/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)\n<A> = (ħ/2) * (4/14)\n<A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7)\n<A> = ħ/7\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator A is ħ/7. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
