    "### Analysis of Reactions\n\nThe user wants to identify the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions.\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The reaction involves a ketone (2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one), an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), and a strong, sterically hindered base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate**: The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6. C2 is substituted with both an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons. C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton. Therefore, deprotonation will occur exclusively at the C6 position, forming a specific enolate.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enolate anion, acting as the Michael donor, will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product Structure (A)**: Following the nucleophilic attack and a workup (which protonates the intermediate), a propanoate group is attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n5.  **Product Naming**: To name the final product, we number the resulting structure. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the substituent group is named based on the parent chain, which is the ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent at position 3. Numbering the cyclohexyl ring for naming purposes starts at the point of attachment (C1). The original carbonyl group is now at C2 (an \"oxo\" group). The ethyl and methyl groups are at C3, and the original C6-methyl group is at C1. This gives the substituent name (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl). Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reactants**: This is also a Michael addition reaction. The reactants are a nitroalkane (1-nitropropane), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile ((E)-but-2-enenitrile, also known as crotononitrile), and a base (potassium hydroxide, KOH).\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile**: The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). This carbon has two acidic protons, and removing one creates a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, which serves as the nucleophile.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN). A new C-C bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n4.  **Product Structure (B)**: After the attack, the intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product: CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN.\n5.  **Product Naming**: For IUPAC naming, the nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority and determines the suffix. The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons, making it a hexanenitrile. Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1. The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4. Therefore, the name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination of products corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
