    "The derivation performed in the thought process is confirmed by the search results. The Boltzmann equation is the correct tool for this problem, relating the population of atomic energy levels to temperature.\n\nThe equation is given by:\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_b and N_a are the number of atoms in energy levels b and a.\n*   g_b and g_a are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   E_b - E_a is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nThe problem states that for a specific energy level, the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. \"Excitation\" refers to the population of a higher energy level relative to a lower one. Let's denote the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (level 2) to the ground state (level 1) as R.\n\n*   R_1 = (N₂/N₁)₁\n*   R₂ = (N₂/N₁)₂\n\nThe problem states R₁ = 2 * R₂.\n\nApplying the Boltzmann equation to each star:\n*   R₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]\n*   R₂ = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nSince we are considering the same energy transition in the same type of atom (iron), the statistical weights (g) and the energy difference (ΔE) are the same for both stars.\n\nSubstituting into R₁ = 2 * R₂:\n(g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nThe statistical weights cancel out:\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\nRearranging the terms to solve for ln(2):\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n\nFactoring out the common term (ΔE / k):\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n\nCombining the fractions in the parenthesis:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is approximately 1 K.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\nln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
