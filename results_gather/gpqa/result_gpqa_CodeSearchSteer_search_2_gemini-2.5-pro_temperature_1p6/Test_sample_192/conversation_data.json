    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine how the number of stars changes with distance.\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between parallax and distance.** Parallax (`plx`) is the apparent shift in a star's position as observed from two different points. It is inversely proportional to the star's distance (`r`). This can be written as:\n    `plx ∝ 1/r` or `r = k/plx` (where `k` is a constant of proportionality).\n\n2.  **State the given information.** The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) as a function of parallax varies as `1/plx^5`. This phrasing refers to the number density of stars with respect to parallax, or the number of stars found per unit interval of parallax. This can be expressed as:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Identify the desired quantity.** The question asks for how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* (`dN/dr`) changes with distance (`r`).\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule to relate the derivatives.** To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative of parallax with respect to distance.** Since `plx = k/r` (from step 1), we can differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr (k * r⁻¹) = -k * r⁻² = -k/r²`\n    The negative sign simply indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For the purpose of proportionality, we are interested in the magnitude.\n\n6.  **Substitute the known relationships.** Now, we substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` (from step 2) and `d(plx)/dr` (from step 5) into the chain rule equation from step 4:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express the final relationship in terms of distance (`r`).** To get the final answer, we replace `plx` with its equivalent in terms of `r` (`plx ∝ 1/r`):\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the cube of the distance.\n\n<<<B>>>"
