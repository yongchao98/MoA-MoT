    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n**1. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\nThe principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. For position (Δx) and momentum (Δp), the relationship is:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s. To find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\nGiven the electron's speed is v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s, which is two-thirds the speed of light, relativistic effects are significant. The relationship between energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m₀) is:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n\nFrom this, we can find how a small change in momentum (Δp) affects the energy (ΔE). The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle.\n\n**3. Calculation**\nFirst, we calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using the given uncertainty in position, Δx = 0.1 nm = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m) ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nNext, we use this value to find the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\n\nΔE = (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s) ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\n\nThis result can be written as:\n\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in the energy is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
