    "This is a classic stoichiometry problem that can be solved by logically piecing together the provided experimental data. Here is a step-by-step deduction to find the composition of salts A and B and determine the total number of atoms.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities\n\nThe mixture of gases from the heated salts was passed through a series of tubes, and the weight changes of these tubes reveal the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of oxygen gas are half the moles of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After the other components were removed, 2.24 liters of gas C remained. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol\n    *   This gas is inert to all the reagents. Given that the starting materials are nitrogen-containing salts (a common feature in such problems), Gas C is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture\n\nBy summing the elements from the gaseous products, we can find the composition of the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O, there are 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol of H atoms.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂, there are (0.20 * 1) + (0.025 * 2) = 0.25 mol of O atoms.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming Gas C is N₂, from 0.10 mol of N₂, there are 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol of N atoms.\n\nLet's check the total mass:\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol * 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol * 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass** = 0.40 + 4.00 + 2.80 = 7.20 g. This matches the initial weight, confirming our calculations and the identity of Gas C as N₂.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe starting material is an equimolar mixture of two salts containing only Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. The most common salts with these elements are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. Let's consider ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe thermal decomposition reactions are:\n1.  **Ammonium nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n2.  **Ammonium nitrate:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). This reaction pathway for ammonium nitrate is known to occur at elevated temperatures.\n\nThe total moles of atoms in the mixture are N: 0.20, H: 0.40, and O: 0.25. The ratio is N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25, which simplifies to an empirical formula of **N₄H₈O₅** for the combined A+B unit.\n\nLet's check if our proposed salts fit this combined formula:\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula is N₂H₄O₂\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula is N₂H₄O₃\n*   **Sum of Formulas (A+B):** (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\nTo be certain, we can calculate the moles of each salt in the 7.20 g mixture. Let 'n' be the moles of each salt.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol\n*   Total mass = n * (64.0) + n * (80.0) = 7.20 g\n*   144.0 * n = 7.20 g  => n = 0.05 mol\n\nNow, let's verify the product amounts from 0.05 mol of each salt:\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃: (0.05/2) * 2 = 0.05 mol N₂, (0.05/2) * 1 = 0.025 mol O₂, and (0.05/2) * 4 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   **Total Products:**\n    *   N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Correct)\n    *   H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol (Correct)\n    *   O₂ = 0.025 mol (Correct)\n\nThe evidence strongly supports that salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final question is for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\nTotal atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
