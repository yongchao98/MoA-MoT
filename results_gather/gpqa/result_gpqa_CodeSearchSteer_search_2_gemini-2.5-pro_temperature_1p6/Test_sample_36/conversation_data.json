    "The series of reactions described leads to the synthesis of a final product, E, through several well-established organic chemistry transformations. To determine the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, each step of the reaction sequence must be analyzed to identify the structure of the final molecule.\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This reaction involves the protection of the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) using BF₃ as a Lewis acid catalyst. This forms a cyclic dithioacetal known as a 1,3-dithiane. The product A is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the acidic proton at the C2 position of the 1,3-dithiane ring (the carbon between the two sulfur atoms). This creates a nucleophilic carbanion, a lithiated dithiane, which is product B. This type of reaction, which reverses the typical electrophilic character of a carbonyl carbon, is known as umpolung.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon in bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an alkylation reaction. An ethyl group is added to the C2 position, resulting in product C, which is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: This step is the deprotection of the dithiane group to regenerate a carbonyl group. Mercuric chloride (HgCl₂) facilitates this hydrolysis. The resulting product, D, is 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This final step is a Wittig reaction. First, a Wittig reagent (a phosphonium ylide) is prepared from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane (CH₃CH₂CH(Br)CH₂CH₃) using BuLi as the base. The ylide formed is Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. This ylide then reacts with the ketone from the previous step, 3-pentanone (D). The reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen of 3-pentanone with the carbon group from the ylide, forming an alkene.\n    *   **Ketone**: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O\n    *   **Ylide**: Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂\n    *   **Product E**: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂\n\nThe final product, E, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\nTo determine the number of signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum, we must analyze the symmetry of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n```\nThis molecule is highly symmetrical. Due to this symmetry, there are only three distinct carbon environments:\n1.  The two carbons forming the central C=C double bond are chemically equivalent.\n2.  The four methylene (-CH₂-) carbons of the ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent.\n3.  The four methyl (-CH₃) carbons of the ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene will show a total of **3 signals**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
