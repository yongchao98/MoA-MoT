    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Starting Compound from NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation:** The formula corresponds to 5 degrees of unsaturation, suggesting a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal (doublet) corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methine (-CH) group, which is consistent with the aldehyde proton coupling. This confirms the presence of a **-CH₂-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The relatively upfield shifts suggest the presence of an electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂) group, which is a strong electron-donating group.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling the fragments gives (4-aminophenyl)ethanal (or p-aminophenylacetaldehyde). The formula for this structure is C₈H₉NO, which matches the given molecular formula.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, (4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n**Reagents 1 and 2: 1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O, Heat**\n*   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n*   **Step 1 (Diazotization):** The primary amine (-NH₂) reacts with NaNO₂ and HCl at low temperatures to form a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The product is (4-formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n*   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** Heating the diazonium salt in water replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product after these two steps is **(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**.\n\n**Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n*   This step involves reacting (4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of (4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form an enolate ion.\n    2.  This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of (4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal. This forms an intermediate called an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This is option A).\n    3.  Because the reaction is heated, this aldol addition product undergoes **dehydration** (loses a molecule of water). The proton on the α-carbon (C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n*   **Final Product:** The dehydration results in the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This structure is a conjugated system, which is thermodynamically favored under heating.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe final product of the entire reaction sequence is the dehydrated aldol condensation product. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal is the intermediate aldol addition product, which dehydrates upon heating.\n*   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal is incorrect as it is not the product of a self-condensation reaction.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the correct structure and name for the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
