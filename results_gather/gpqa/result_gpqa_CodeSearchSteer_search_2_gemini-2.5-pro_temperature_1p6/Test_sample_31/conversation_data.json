    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus.\n\n1.  **Identify the nucleus and its components:**\n    The problem specifies the nucleus X as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. The atomic number of Lithium is 3, which means it has 3 protons. Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li), consisting of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n\n2.  **Determine the speed and calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    The speed (v) is given as 0.96c, where c is the speed of light.\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    γ = 1 / 0.28\n    γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n3.  **Determine the rest mass energy of the nucleus (m₀c²):**\n    A precise calculation would use the measured mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus, which includes the effect of nuclear binding energy. However, let's test the hypothesis that the problem intends for the rest mass to be the sum of the individual masses of its constituent protons and neutrons.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton (mₚc²): approximately 938.272 MeV.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a neutron (mₙc²): approximately 939.565 MeV.\n\n    The total rest mass energy is the sum of the energies of the 3 protons and 3 neutrons:\n    m₀c² = 3 * (mₚc²) + 3 * (mₙc²)\n    m₀c² = 3 * (938.272 MeV) + 3 * (939.565 MeV)\n    m₀c² = 2814.816 MeV + 2818.695 MeV\n    m₀c² = 5633.511 MeV = 5.6335 GeV\n\n4.  **Calculate the total relativistic energy (E):**\n    The total energy is given by Einstein's relativistic energy equation:\n    E = γ * m₀c²\n    E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6335 GeV\n    E ≈ 20.1196 GeV\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The calculated energy of approximately 20.120 GeV is extremely close to option B. The minor difference can be attributed to using slightly different values for the proton and neutron rest masses.\n\n    *   A) 23.069 GeV\n    *   B) 20.132 GeV\n    *   C) 21.419 GeV\n    *   D) 18.475 GeV\n\nThe calculated value most closely matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
