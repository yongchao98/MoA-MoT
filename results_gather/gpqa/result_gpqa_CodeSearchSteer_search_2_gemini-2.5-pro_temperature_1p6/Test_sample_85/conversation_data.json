    "To solve this problem, we must determine the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and borane (BH3), towards a starting material that contains both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The starting material is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid). This starting material has a chiral center at the carbon with the ethyl group, which can be in either the (R) or (S) configuration.\n\nThe general structure of the starting material is:\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-isobutyl\n\nThe final product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), specifically 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This product is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. Therefore, both reaction sequences must produce this hydroxy acid as an intermediate.\n\n**Analysis of the Reducing Agents:**\n\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** Borane is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of other carbonyl functionalities like esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while leaving the ester group (-CO-O-isobutyl) intact.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** LiBH₄ is a more complex case. While it is a strong reducing agent, it exhibits useful chemoselectivity. LiBH₄ can selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. This is because the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid reacts first with the hydride to form a lithium carboxylate salt and hydrogen gas. This carboxylate salt is less electrophilic and thus less reactive towards further reduction compared to the ester group.\n\n**Tracing the Reactions:**\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  Starting material **A** (which has both a -COOH and a -COOR' group) reacts with LiBH₄.\n2.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group to a primary alcohol.\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOR' → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n3.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone product.\n5.  During this entire sequence, the stereocenter at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group) is not involved in any bond-breaking or forming and thus retains its original configuration. This carbon becomes the C4 of the lactone.\n6.  Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n7.  So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  Starting material **B** reacts with BH₃.\n2.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester untouched.\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOR' → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOR'\n3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) serves two purposes: it hydrolyzes the isobutyl ester to a carboxylic acid, and it catalyzes the subsequent lactonization.\n    HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOR' → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH\n4.  This intermediate is, again, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which cyclizes to the lactone.\n5.  As in the first reaction, the stereochemistry at the chiral center is preserved throughout the process.\n6.  To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n7.  So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
