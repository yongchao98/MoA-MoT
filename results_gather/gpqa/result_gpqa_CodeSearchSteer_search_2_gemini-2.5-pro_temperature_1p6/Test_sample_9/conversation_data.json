    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to analyze the properties of each option based on physical principles.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially a planet with Earth's characteristics. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as about 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** A planet with a lower mass exerts less gravitational force on itself. This results in less \"gravitational compression,\" meaning its material will be less squeezed together compared to Earth. Therefore, its density will be lower than Earth's 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** The key principle here is gravitational compression. As a planet's mass increases, its gravitational pull becomes stronger, compressing the materials it's made of and significantly increasing its overall density. Since this planet has the same composition as Earth but is much more massive, it will be compressed to a much greater degree. This self-compression will make its density considerably higher than Earth's.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Planet (a): ~5.51 g/cm³\n*   Planet (b): ~5.5 g/cm³\n*   Planet (c): Significantly > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to greater mass and gravitational compression)\n*   Planet (d): < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to less mass and gravitational compression)\n\nComparing the options, the 5-Earth-mass planet with the same composition as Earth will be the densest.\n\n<<<A>>>"
