    "To solve this problem, we must first identify the initial and final energy states of the diatomic molecule and then calculate the energy difference, which corresponds to the energy of the absorbed photon. From the photon's energy, we can determine its momentum.\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The molecule is initially in its **fundamental (or ground) state**. In the rotation-vibration model, this corresponds to the lowest vibrational quantum number, `v=0`, and the lowest rotational quantum number, `J=0`.\n    *   The problem asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" upon absorbing a photon. For heteronuclear diatomic molecules, the selection rules for rovibrational transitions are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n    *   Starting from `v=0, J=0`, the only allowed transition to a higher energy state is to `v=1, J=1`. This corresponds to a change of `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = +1`, which is the first line of the R-branch in the rovibrational spectrum.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy of the Transition (ΔE):**\n    The energy of a state in the non-rigid rotor model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    `E(v,J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * J(J + 1)`\n    Where:\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s)\n    *   `I` is the moment of inertia\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number\n\n    The energy change (`ΔE`) is the difference between the final state `E(1,1)` and the initial state `E(0,0)`:\n    `ΔE = E(1,1) - E(0,0)`\n    `ΔE = [ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * 1(1+1)] - [ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * 0(0+1)]`\n    `ΔE = [3/2 * ħω + ħ²/I] - [1/2 * ħω + 0]`\n    `ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Physical Constants:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu`\n        Converting to kg: `μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        `I = μ * R²`\n        Given R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n        `I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Change Components:**\n    *   **Vibrational Energy Change (`ħω`):**\n        `ΔE_vib = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n    *   **Rotational Energy Change (`ħ²/I`):**\n        `ΔE_rot = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy Change (ΔE):**\n    `ΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.00092 x 10⁻²⁰ J) ≈ 4.2169 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n    As you can see, the rotational energy component is very small compared to the vibrational component.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p):**\n    The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light (≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\n    `p = ΔE / c`\n    `p = (4.2169 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.4056 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s\nB) p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s\nC) p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s\nD) p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s\n\nThe calculated value of `1.4056 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
