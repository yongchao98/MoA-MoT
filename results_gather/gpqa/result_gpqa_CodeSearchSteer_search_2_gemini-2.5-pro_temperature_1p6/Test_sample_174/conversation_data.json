    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. A spheroid shape with symmetry along the z-axis that is oscillating can be approximated as a simple oscillating electric dipole, especially for the fundamental radiation mode. This is the most common and dominant form of radiation unless suppressed by specific symmetries.\n\n### Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) in the far-field (radiation zone) is given by:\n\n*dP/dΩ ∝ sin²θ*\n\nHere, θ is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis). The radiated power is zero along the axis of the dipole (θ = 0°) and maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole (θ = 90°).\n\nThe maximum power, A, is radiated at θ = 90°.\nA = (dP/dΩ)_max ∝ sin²(90°) = 1\n\nTo find the fraction of this maximum power radiated at θ = 30°, we calculate:\n\nFraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°)\nSince sin(30°) = 1/2 and sin(90°) = 1, the fraction is:\nFraction = (1/2)² / 1² = 1/4\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴). The relationship between angular frequency (ω) and wavelength (λ) is ω = 2πc/λ, where c is the speed of light.\n\nTherefore, the power dependence on wavelength is:\n\n*Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴*\n\nThis λ⁻⁴ dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is also known as Rayleigh's law, which explains, for example, why the sky is blue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two results:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power A radiated at an angle of 30° is 1/4.\n*   The functional form of the radiated power's dependence on wavelength is λ⁻⁴.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
