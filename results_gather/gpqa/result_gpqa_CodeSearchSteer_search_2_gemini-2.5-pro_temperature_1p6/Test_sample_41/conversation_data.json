    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Relationship Between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates back into space. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis, or the orbital distance for a circular orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\nIn this system, all three planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem also states that the albedo (`A`) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to show that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nThis means that for any two planets (x and y) in the system, the ratio of their temperatures is related to the ratio of their orbital distances as follows:\n\n(T_x / T_y) = √(a_y / a_x)\n\nSquaring both sides gives:\n\n(T_x / T_y)² = a_y / a_x\n\n**2. Calculate the Ratios of the Orbital Distances**\n\nWe are given the temperature ratios between the planets:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing the formula from Step 1, we can find the ratios of their orbital distances:\n*   For Planet 1 and Planet 2:\n    a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² ≈ 1.4² = 1.96\n\n*   For Planet 2 and Planet 3:\n    a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² ≈ 2.3² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 (a3 / a1), we multiply the individual ratios:\n\na3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684\n\n**3. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a) when orbiting the same star.\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nThis can be written as a ratio for two planets (x and y):\n\n(P_x / P_y)² = (a_x / a_y)³\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n\nP_x / P_y = (a_x / a_y)^(3/2)\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 (P3 / P1). Using the result from Step 2 and the formula from Step 3:\n\nP3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) ≈ (10.3684)^(3/2)\n\nCalculating this value:\n\nP3 / P1 ≈ (10.3684)^1.5 ≈ 33.3856\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the masses of the planets (M1/M2 and M2/M3) and the TTV discovery method is not needed for this calculation and serves as extraneous data.\n\nThe orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
