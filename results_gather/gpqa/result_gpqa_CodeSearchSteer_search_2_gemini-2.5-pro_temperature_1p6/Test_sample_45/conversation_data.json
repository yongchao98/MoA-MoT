    "The reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with a Grubbs catalyst is an olefin self-metathesis. This reaction involves the cutting and reforming of the carbon-carbon double bonds. The reactant is a racemic mixture, meaning it contains equal amounts of two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\nThe metathesis can occur in three different ways:\n1.  Reaction between two molecules of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n2.  Reaction between two molecules of (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n3.  Cross-reaction between one molecule of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and one molecule of (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\nIn each case, two molecules of the starting alkene (CH₂=CH-R, where R is the 3-methylpentyl group) react to form one molecule of a larger alkene (R-CH=CH-R) and one molecule of ethene (CH₂=CH₂). The question asks for the number of possible products excluding ethene.\n\nThe product R-CH=CH-R is **4,5-dimethyl-3-octene**. We need to consider the stereochemistry of this product. The product has two chiral centers at positions 4 and 5, and a new double bond at position 3, which can have either E or Z stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene**\n    This reaction forms a product with two (R) chiral centers: (4R,5R)-4,5-dimethyl-3-octene. This can exist as two different stereoisomers (diastereomers) depending on the geometry of the double bond:\n    *   (E)-(4R,5R)-4,5-dimethyl-3-octene\n    *   (Z)-(4R,5R)-4,5-dimethyl-3-octene\n\n*   **Reaction 2: (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene**\n    This reaction forms a product with two (S) chiral centers: (4S,5S)-4,5-dimethyl-3-octene. These products are the enantiomers of the products from the R+R reaction. Again, two diastereomers are possible:\n    *   (E)-(4S,5S)-4,5-dimethyl-3-octene\n    *   (Z)-(4S,5S)-4,5-dimethyl-3-octene\n\n*   **Reaction 3: (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene**\n    This cross-reaction forms a product with one (R) and one (S) chiral center: (4R,5S)-4,5-dimethyl-3-octene. This particular combination of chiral centers results in a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. This meso compound can also exist as two diastereomers based on the double bond geometry:\n    *   (E)-(4R,5S)-4,5-dimethyl-3-octene (meso)\n    *   (Z)-(4R,5S)-4,5-dimethyl-3-octene (meso)\n\nIn total, we have 2 (from R+R) + 2 (from S+S) + 2 (from R+S) = 6 possible stereoisomeric products. These are all distinct chemical compounds.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 possible products excluding ethene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
