    "To identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound, let's first deduce its structure based on the provided information.\n\n### Compound Structure Analysis\n\n1.  **Core Structure**: The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n2.  **Total Carbons**: The entire molecule contains 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbons.\n3.  **Functional Groups**: The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the benzene ring).\n4.  **Possible Substituents**:\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X, where X is likely Cl, Br, or I).\n    *   The other substituent must contain a carbonyl group and, along with the first substituent, total 2 carbons. The most common and logical structure for this second substituent is an acetyl group (-COCH₃), which contains two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nCombining these pieces, the most plausible compound is a halo-acetophenone. A common example is 4-chloroacetophenone. This molecule is a di-substituted benzene ring, has 8 total carbons (6 in the ring + 2 in the acetyl group), features a carbonyl group, and has an aromatic-halogen bond. The chemical formula is C₈H₇ClO.\n\n### ¹H NMR Spectrum Prediction for 4-Chloroacetophenone\n\nFor a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring like 4-chloroacetophenone, we expect a characteristic pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic Protons (C₆H₄)**: Due to the ring's symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent protons.\n    *   Two protons are *ortho* (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group. These will be shifted significantly downfield.\n    *   Two protons are *ortho* to the chlorine atom.\n    *   This arrangement typically results in two distinct doublets in the range of 7.0-8.0 ppm, with each signal integrating to 2H.\n*   **Acetyl Group Protons (-COCH₃)**: The methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl, which deshields the protons.\n    *   This will appear as a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with).\n    *   Its chemical shift is typically around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n    *   The signal will integrate to 3H.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nNow let's compare this prediction with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This data does not match. The chemical shifts around 4.6-4.8 ppm are not typical for aromatic protons, and the splitting patterns and integrations are inconsistent with the predicted structure.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum fits the prediction for 4-chloroacetophenone perfectly. It shows two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 and 7.6 ppm), each integrating to 2H, which is characteristic of a para-substituted ring. It also has a singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H, corresponding to the acetyl methyl group. Published spectral data for 4'-Chloroacetophenone confirms these values, with signals at δ 7.89 (d, 2H), 7.43 (d, 2H), and 2.59 (s, 3H), which is a very close match.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect for the same reasons as option A; the chemical shifts are not in the aromatic proton range.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). While an aldehyde is a carbonyl-containing group, and a structure like 4-chlorophenylacetaldehyde (C₈H₇ClO) is possible, the presented data is less likely. Specifically, the methylene (-CH₂) and aldehyde (-CHO) protons would be expected to show coupling (a doublet and a triplet, respectively), not appear as two separate singlets. While possible under certain conditions, it is not the most standard representation. The data in option B is a classic, unambiguous match for the more common structural isomer, 4-chloroacetophenone.\n\nBased on this analysis, the data in option B is the most accurate and chemically sound representation for the described compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
