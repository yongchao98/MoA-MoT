    "The search results confirm the general methodology. Several sources describe the phosphate buffer system consisting of H₂PO₄⁻ (the weak acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (the conjugate base). The relationship between pH, pKa, and the ratio of the base to the acid is governed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The specific dissociation of H₂PO₄⁻ to HPO₄²⁻ is related to Ka₂, and the further dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ to PO₄³⁻ is related to Ka₃. The method of first finding the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] from the Ka₂ equilibrium and then using it to find the concentration of the final species, PO₄³⁻, from the Ka₃ equilibrium is a standard and correct procedure for polyprotic acid buffer systems.\n\nMy initial calculation steps were:\n1.  Calculate moles of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.\n2.  Calculate the initial molar concentrations of [H₂PO₄⁻] and [HPO₄²⁻].\n3.  Use the Ka₂ expression to find the [H⁺] of the buffer.\n4.  Use the [H⁺], the initial [HPO₄²⁻], and the Ka₃ value to find the final [PO₄³⁻].\n\nThis matches the standard chemical principles outlined in the search results. My initial calculation yielded a result of 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M, which is extremely close to option D. I am confident in this approach and the result.\n\nHere is a summary of the calculation:\n\n**1. Moles of Components:**\n*   Volume = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n*   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n**2. Initial Concentrations:**\n*   [H₂PO₄⁻] (from KH₂PO₄) = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   [HPO₄²⁻] (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O) = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\nThe primary buffer equilibrium is:\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\nThis equilibrium is described by Ka₂.\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n6.2 x 10⁻⁸ = [H⁺](0.02809 M) / (0.03674 M)\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 / 0.02809)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Determine Orthophosphate Ion [PO₄³⁻] Concentration:**\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed in the third dissociation step:\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\nThis equilibrium is described by Ka₃.\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
