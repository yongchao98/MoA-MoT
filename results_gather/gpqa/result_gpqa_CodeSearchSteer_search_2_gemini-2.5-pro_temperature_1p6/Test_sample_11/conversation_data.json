    "The problem involves a two-body decay of a stationary particle. To solve this, we must use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nPi(+) → mu(+) + ν (muon neutrino)\n\nGiven information:\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+) (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+) (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The Pi(+) is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\n*   The neutrino (ν) is assumed to be massless.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy of the system is the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n*   E_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n\nThe final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n*   E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n*   The total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and its rest mass energy (m*c²).\n*   E_μ = KE_μ + m_μ*c²\n*   E_ν = KE_ν (since the neutrino is massless, its rest energy is zero).\n\nTherefore, the conservation of energy equation is:\nm_π*c² = (KE_μ + m_μ*c²) + KE_ν\n139.6 MeV = KE_μ + 105.7 MeV + KE_ν\nThis gives us the total kinetic energy of the products:\nKE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero.\n*   p_initial = 0\n\nThe final momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the muon (p_μ) and the neutrino (p_ν). For the total momentum to remain zero, the two product particles must move in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\n*   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**3. Calculation of Kinetic Energies:**\nWe can now find the individual kinetic energies. A direct formula for the kinetic energy of the massive decay product (muon) in a two-body decay of a stationary particle is:\n\nKE_μ = ( (m_π*c²)² + (m_μ*c²)² - (m_ν*c²)² ) / ( 2 * m_π*c² ) - m_μ*c²\nSince m_ν = 0:\nKE_μ = ( (m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2)^2 ) / (2 * m_pi*c^2)\nKE_μ = ( (139.6 - 105.7)^2 ) / (2 * 139.6) is not the right formula.\n\nLet's use the formula for the momentum `p`:\np*c = ( (m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² ) / ( 2 * m_π*c² )\np*c = ( 139.6² - 105.7² ) / ( 2 * 139.6 )\np*c = ( 19488.16 - 11172.49 ) / 279.2\np*c = 8315.67 / 279.2\np*c ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nFor the massless neutrino, its total energy is its kinetic energy, which is equal to `p*c`.\n*   KE_ν = p*c ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\nNow we calculate the kinetic energy of the muon:\n*   KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ*c²\n*   where E_μ = sqrt( (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)² )\n*   E_μ = sqrt( (29.8)² + (105.7)² )\n*   E_μ = sqrt( 888.04 + 11172.49 )\n*   E_μ = sqrt( 12060.53 ) ≈ 109.82 MeV\n*   KE_μ = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon (+) and the neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively.\n\n<<<A>>>"
