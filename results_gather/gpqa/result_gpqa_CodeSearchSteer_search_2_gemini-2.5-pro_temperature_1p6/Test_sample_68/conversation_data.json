    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\nTo observe a decay, the particle's track before it decays must be sufficiently long to be resolved by a detector. Let's call the detector's minimum spatial resolution *d*. This means we can only observe decays where the particle travels a distance *L* greater than or equal to *d*. The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\nThe decay of particles follows an exponential probability distribution. The fraction of particles that travel a distance *L* or more before decaying is given by:\n\nP(distance ≥ *d*) = e<sup>-*d* / L<sub>avg</sub></sup>\n\nWhere *L<sub>avg</sub>* is the mean (average) decay length of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n\nTo observe at least 30% of the decays, we need:\n\ne<sup>-*d* / L<sub>avg</sub></sup> ≥ 0.30\n\nTo find the minimum required resolution, which corresponds to the largest possible value of *d* that satisfies the condition, we use the equality:\n\ne<sup>-*d* / L<sub>avg</sub></sup> = 0.30\n\nSolving for *d*, we get:\n\n*d* = -L<sub>avg</sub> * ln(0.30) ≈ 1.204 * L<sub>avg</sub>\n\n### 2. Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L<sub>avg</sub>)\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame depends on the particle's proper lifetime (τ₀), its velocity (*v*), and relativistic effects.\n\n**a. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor γ relates the energy in the lab frame (E) to the rest mass energy (mc²).\nGiven:\n*   E = 27 GeV\n*   m<sub>X⁰</sub>c² = 3.41 GeV\n\nγ = E / (mc²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.9179\n\n**b. Calculate the Mean Lifetime in the Lab Frame (τ<sub>lab</sub>):**\nTime dilation causes the lifetime of a moving particle to be longer in the lab frame than in its own rest frame.\nGiven:\n*   τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s\n\nτ<sub>lab</sub> = γ * τ₀ = 7.9179 * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) ≈ 6.3343 × 10⁻¹⁵ s\n\n**c. Calculate the Particle's Velocity (v):**\nThe velocity *v* can be found from the Lorentz factor.\nβ = v/c = √(1 - 1/γ²)\nβ = √(1 - 1 / 7.9179²) ≈ √(1 - 0.01595) ≈ √0.98405 ≈ 0.992\nSo, the particle's speed is approximately 99.2% of the speed of light (*c*).\n\n**d. Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L<sub>avg</sub>):**\nThe mean decay length is the distance the particle travels on average during its lab-frame lifetime.\nL<sub>avg</sub> = v * τ<sub>lab</sub> = (β * c) * τ<sub>lab</sub>\nL<sub>avg</sub> = 0.992 * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (6.3343 × 10⁻¹⁵ s) ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n*Alternatively, a more direct formula combines these steps:*\nL<sub>avg</sub> = (pc / mc²) * (cτ₀), where pc = √(E² - (mc²)²)\npc = √(27² - 3.41²) = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78 GeV\nL<sub>avg</sub> = (26.78 / 3.41) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s * 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) ≈ 7.853 * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### 3. Calculate the Required Resolution\nNow we use the formula derived in the first section:\n\n*d* = 1.204 * L<sub>avg</sub>\n*d* = 1.204 * (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m)\n*d* ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe calculated minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m. Comparing this value to the given options:\n\nA) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nThe value 2.27 * 1e-6 m is closest to option C, 2.08 * 1e-6 m. The small discrepancy (around 9%) might be due to slight inaccuracies in the problem's given values or the options provided. However, option C is the only one with the correct order of magnitude and is numerically the closest fit. If we assume the resolution is 2.08 * 1e-6 m, this would allow the observation of approximately 33% of the decays (since e<sup>-(2.08/1.885)</sup> ≈ 0.33), which satisfies the condition of \"at least 30%\".\n\n<<<C>>>"
