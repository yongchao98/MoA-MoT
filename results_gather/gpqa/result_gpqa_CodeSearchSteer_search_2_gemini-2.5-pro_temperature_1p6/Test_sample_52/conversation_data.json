    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR and FTIR Data to Identify Structural Fragments:**\n    *   **FTIR:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in each of the proposed formulas and contains one degree of unsaturation (C=O).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two signals in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum. For a di-substituted benzene ring, this strongly suggests a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern. This pattern leads to two pairs of chemically equivalent protons on the ring, resulting in two distinct signals. This fragment is a `C6H4` group.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons:** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons, described as one doublet and one doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a `-CH=CH-CH3` (prop-1-enyl) group. The proton adjacent to the ring is split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton. The second vinyl proton is split by both the first vinyl proton and the three protons of the methyl group, resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH3) groups. One of these belongs to the prop-1-enyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   **No -CH2- Groups:** The explicit absence of any methylene (-CH2-) signals is a crucial piece of information. This indicates that the ester group cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or any other alkyl ester that contains a -CH2- group. Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`). This accounts for the second methyl signal.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified, the compound consists of a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring where the two substituents are a prop-1-enyl group and a methyl ester group. The most likely structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Chemical Formula from the Deduced Structure:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the assembled structure: `C6H4(CH=CHCH3)(COOCH3)`.\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (in the ring) + 3 (in the propenyl group) + 1 (in the ester carbonyl) + 1 (in the ester methyl) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (on the ring) + 5 (in the propenyl group) + 3 (in the ester methyl) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (in the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This identity is confirmed by chemical databases for (E)-Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The degree of unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **From the structure:** 1 benzene ring (4 DoU) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DoU) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   **From the formula C11H12O2:** DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6 DoU**.\n    The calculated degree of unsaturation matches, confirming the proposed structure is consistent. Checking the DoU for the other options shows that only C12H14O2 also has a DoU of 6, but it would require an additional -CH2- group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
