    "To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected by ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider the atmospheric cutoff for ultraviolet radiation.\n\n### Key Wavelengths and the Role of the Atmosphere\n\n*   **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) Wavelength:** The absorption of light by neutral hydrogen occurs at the Lyman-alpha wavelength, which is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers (nm). This wavelength falls within the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n*   **Atmospheric Cutoff:** The Earth's atmosphere, particularly the ozone layer, absorbs most ultraviolet radiation. The \"optical window,\" which is the range of wavelengths that can pass through the atmosphere to reach ground-based telescopes, begins at around 300 nm (3000 Å). Some sources cite a more conservative cutoff of 3400 Å due to significant ozone absorption below this wavelength. For this estimation, we will use the more common 3000 Å as the shortest detectable wavelength.\n\n### Redshift Calculation\n\nThe redshift, denoted by *z*, describes how much the wavelength of light from a distant object is stretched as it travels towards an observer. The relationship is given by the formula:\n\n*z* = (λ_observed - λ_rest) / λ_rest\n\nThis can be rearranged to solve for *z*:\n\n*z* = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\nWhere:\n*   λ_observed is the wavelength measured by the telescope on Earth.\n*   λ_rest is the wavelength emitted by the source (the rest wavelength).\n\nTo find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we need the Lyα line to be shifted just enough to pass through the atmosphere. Therefore, λ_observed must be at least 3000 Å.\n\n*   **λ_rest** = 1216 Å\n*   **λ_observed (minimum)** = 3000 Å\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n*z* = (3000 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\n*z* ≈ 2.467 - 1\n*z* ≈ 1.467\n\nLet's re-evaluate using a slightly different atmospheric cutoff to see the sensitivity of the result. For instance, using 3300 Å (from some spectrograph ranges):\n\n*z* = (3300 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\n*z* ≈ 2.71 - 1\n*z* ≈ 1.71\n\nAnd for a cutoff of 3400 Å:\n\n*z* = (3400 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\n*z* ≈ 2.796 - 1\n*z* ≈ 1.796\n\nGiven the provided options, the value of 1.9 aligns well with a realistic atmospheric cutoff that is slightly higher than the absolute minimum of 3000 Å, accounting for practical observational limits where atmospheric transparency becomes sufficiently high for detection. Using a cutoff wavelength of ~3526 Å would yield a redshift of 1.9.\n\nλ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.9) = 1216 Å * 2.9 = 3526.4 Å (or 352.6 nm)\n\nThis wavelength is well within the capabilities of ground-based optical spectrographs.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable estimate among the choices is 1.9.\n\n<<<C>>>"
