    "The calculation of non-Gaussianity (nG) for the specified Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy is performed as follows.\n\n### 1. Definition of the State and Parameters\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n`|ψ> = (cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α>) / N`\n\nThe problem specifies the following parameters:\n*   Amplitude `α = 0.5`\n*   Phase `φ = -π / 4`\n\nFor `φ = -π / 4`, we have `cos(φ) = 1/√2` and `sin(φ) = -1/√2`. The state is an \"odd\" cat state:\n`|ψ> = (1/N) * (1/√2) * (|α> - |-α>)`\n\nThe normalization constant `N` is given by `N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*φ)*exp(-2*α^2))`.\nWith the given parameters:\n`sin(2*φ) = sin(-π/2) = -1`\n`exp(-2*α^2) = exp(-2 * 0.5^2) = exp(-0.5)`\n`N^2 = 1 - exp(-0.5)`\nTherefore, the full state vector is `|ψ> = (|α> - |-α>) / sqrt(2 * (1 - exp(-0.5)))`.\n\n### 2. Relative Entropy Measure of Non-Gaussianity\nThe relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity is defined as:\n`nG = S(τ) - S(ρ)`\nwhere:\n*   `ρ = |ψ><ψ|` is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state.\n*   `τ` is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as `ρ`.\n*   `S(ρ) = -Tr(ρ ln ρ)` is the von Neumann entropy.\n\nSince `|ψ>` is a pure state, its entropy `S(ρ)` is zero. Thus, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`nG = S(τ)`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Moments of the State `ρ`\nTo find the reference Gaussian state `τ`, we first need to calculate the first and second moments of `ρ`.\n*   **First moments (mean displacement):** The mean annihilation operator `<a>` is found to be zero for this state (`<a> = <ψ|a|ψ> = 0`). This means the reference Gaussian state is centered (has zero displacement).\n*   **Second moments:** We need to calculate the average photon number `<n> = <ψ|a†a|ψ>` and the pairing term `<a^2> = <ψ|a^2|ψ>`. For the given odd cat state, these are:\n    *   `<n> = α^2 * (1 + exp(-2*α^2)) / (1 - exp(-2*α^2)) = α^2 * coth(α^2)`\n    *   `<a^2> = α^2`\n\n### 4. Entropy of the Reference Gaussian State `τ`\nThe entropy of a single-mode, centered Gaussian state `τ` is determined by its covariance matrix. The entropy can be calculated from the state's symplectic eigenvalue, `v`, using the formula for the entropy of a thermal state with a mean photon number `n_th = v - 1/2`:\n`S(τ) = (n_th + 1) * ln(n_th + 1) - n_th * ln(n_th)`\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalue `v` is related to the second moments by:\n`v^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n\n### 5. Numerical Calculation\nNow we plug in the values `α = 0.5` (`α^2 = 0.25`):\n*   `exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065`\n*   `<n> = 0.25 * (1 + 0.6065) / (1 - 0.6065) ≈ 0.25 * 1.6065 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.0207`\n*   `<a^2> = α^2 = 0.25`\n\nNext, we calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `v`:\n*   `v^2 = (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n*   `v^2 = (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n*   `v = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n\nNow, we find the equivalent thermal photon number `n_th`:\n*   `n_th = v - 1/2 = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1`\n\nFinally, we calculate the non-Gaussianity `nG = S(τ)`:\n*   `nG = (1 + 1) * ln(1 + 1) - 1 * ln(1)`\n*   `nG = 2 * ln(2) - 0`\n*   `nG ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\nThe calculated value of non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.386.\n\n<<<D>>>"
