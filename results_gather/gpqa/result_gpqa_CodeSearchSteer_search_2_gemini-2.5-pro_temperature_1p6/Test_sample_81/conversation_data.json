    "The problem describes a three-step chemical synthesis and asks for the structure of the major isomer of the final product. Let's analyze each step.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene + Maleic Anhydride → Product 1**\nCyclooctatetraene (COT) exists in a tub-like conformation. When heated, it undergoes a valence tautomerization to form bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This bicyclic isomer contains a conjugated diene system (a cyclohexadiene) which can participate in a Diels-Alder reaction. Maleic anhydride is a good dienophile. The Diels-Alder reaction between bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene and maleic anhydride proceeds with *exo* stereoselectivity. This means the anhydride group is on the opposite side (anti) to the smaller bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system. This yields Product 1, which retains the cyclobutene ring from the initial COT isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + Methanol + H₂SO₄ → Product 2**\nProduct 1 is a dicarboxylic anhydride. Heating an anhydride with an alcohol (methanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst (sulfuric acid) results in the opening of the anhydride ring to form a diester. This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The two anhydride carbonyls are converted into two methyl ester groups. This reaction does not alter the stereochemistry of the polycyclic carbon framework. Therefore, Product 2 is the dimethyl ester corresponding to Product 1, maintaining the *exo* configuration of the ester groups.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + Cyclopentadiene → Final Product 3**\nProduct 2 contains a double bond in the cyclobutene ring, which can act as a dienophile in a second Diels-Alder reaction. Cyclopentadiene is a highly reactive diene. The reaction between Product 2 and cyclopentadiene is a [4+2] cycloaddition. In Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclopentadiene, the major product is typically the *endo* isomer under kinetic control. This preference is due to favorable secondary orbital interactions between the p-orbitals of the diene and the unsaturated substituents on the dienophile. In this case, the dienophile (the cyclobutene double bond) is part of a large, rigid structure. The cyclopentadiene will add to the cyclobutene double bond in such a way that the newly formed methylene bridge is *anti* (exo) to the ester groups, which places the rest of the diene skeleton in the *endo* position relative to the dienophile's bicyclic system. The stereochemistry from the previous steps is retained.\n\nCombining these steps, the final product (Product 3) is the result of two sequential, stereospecific Diels-Alder reactions and an esterification.\n1.  **First Diels-Alder (COT + Maleic Anhydride):** *exo* addition.\n2.  **Esterification:** No change in stereochemistry of the carbon skeleton.\n3.  **Second Diels-Alder (Product 2 + Cyclopentadiene):** *endo* addition.\n\nBased on this stereochemical analysis, the resulting major isomer has the specific arrangement of all chiral centers as described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
