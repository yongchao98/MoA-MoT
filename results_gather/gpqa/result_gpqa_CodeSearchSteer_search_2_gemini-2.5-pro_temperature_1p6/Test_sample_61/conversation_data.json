    "The synthesis of 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane involves a multi-step process. The target molecule is the product of a self-aldol condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Therefore, the core of the problem is to first synthesize cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, and then induce the aldol condensation.\n\nLet's break down the correct sequence of reactions as presented in option C:\n\n1.  **Alkylation of Ethynylcyclohexane:** The process starts with the deprotonation of ethynylcyclohexane using a strong base, sodium amide (NaNH₂), to form a sodium acetylide. This acetylide is a potent nucleophile and reacts with methyl chloride to form 1-cyclohexylpropyne, extending the carbon chain by one methyl group.\n    *   C₆H₁₁-C≡CH + NaNH₂ → C₆H₁₁-C≡C⁻Na⁺\n    *   C₆H₁₁-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH₃Cl → C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃\n\n2.  **Partial Hydrogenation:** The resulting internal alkyne, 1-cyclohexylpropyne, is then subjected to partial hydrogenation using a Lindlar catalyst (H₂/Pd-CaCO₃). This specific catalyst is \"poisoned\" to reduce its activity, allowing the reaction to stop at the alkene stage, yielding the *cis*-alkene, (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene.\n    *   C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃ + H₂/Lindlar catalyst → *cis*-C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃\n\n3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis:** The alkene is then cleaved using ozone (O₃) followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide ((CH₃)₂S). This reaction breaks the carbon-carbon double bond and forms two carbonyl compounds: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n    *   *cis*-C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃ + 1. O₃, 2. (CH₃)₂S → C₆H₁₁-CHO + CH₃CHO\n\n4.  **Aldol Condensation:** Finally, a base such as barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂) is used to catalyze an aldol condensation. Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde possesses an acidic α-hydrogen on the ring, allowing it to form an enolate and undergo a self-aldol reaction. Although the reaction mixture also contains acetaldehyde, it is highly volatile (boiling point ~20°C) compared to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (boiling point ~162°C) and can be easily removed, allowing the self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to proceed and form the desired final product, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   2 C₆H₁₁-CHO --(Ba(OH)₂)→ 1-((cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\n\nAnalyzing the other options reveals their incorrectness:\n*   **A)** The steps are in an illogical order; for instance, complete hydrogenation with H₂/Pd would form an alkane, which is unreactive in the subsequent steps.\n*   **B)** Ozonolysis with an oxidative workup (H₂O) would produce carboxylic acids, not the required aldehyde.\n*   **D)** The initial reaction with methanol would simply reverse the deprotonation of the alkyne, making the sequence unproductive.\n\nTherefore, the only chemically viable pathway among the choices is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
