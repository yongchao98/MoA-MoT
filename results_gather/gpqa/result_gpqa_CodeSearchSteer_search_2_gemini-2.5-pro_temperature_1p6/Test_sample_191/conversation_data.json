    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the situation to determine the electric field outside the conductor:\n\n1.  **Induced Charges:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity attracts the free electrons (which are negative charges) in the conductor. A total charge of `-q` accumulates on the inner surface of the cavity. This happens because the electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall electrical neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to balance the `-q` that was induced on the inner cavity surface.\n\n3.  **Distribution of the Outer Charge:** A key principle for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the charge on its outer surface will distribute itself in a way that is independent of the arrangement of any charges within a cavity. For a spherical conductor, this outer charge `+q` will spread uniformly over its surface. The exact location of the charge `+q` and the cavity inside does not affect the uniform distribution of the charge on the *outer* surface.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Since the `+q` charge is distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the spherical conductor (of radius R), the electric field it produces at an external point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Field at Point P:** The point P is located at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Using Coulomb's law for the field of a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    The information about the cavity's radius `r`, its distance from the center `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸` is irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor, due to the electrostatic shielding effect.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the magnitude of the electric field at point P is determined solely by the total charge induced on the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`).\n\n<<<A>>>"
