    "Here is an analysis of the two nuclear decay processes to determine the correct option.\n\n### Understanding the Decays\n\n1.  **Original Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n    This process is analogous to the standard two-neutrino double beta decay (`2νββ`), where two nucleons (A) convert into two other nucleons (B) while emitting two electrons (E) and two antineutrinos (V). The total energy released, known as the Q-value, is determined by the mass difference between the initial and final nuclei. This energy is shared among the kinetic energies of the final particles. Because the two V particles can carry away a variable amount of energy, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two E particles has a continuous spectrum. The endpoint of this spectrum, `Q`, corresponds to the maximum possible energy for the two E particles, which occurs when the two V particles carry away the minimum possible energy.\n\n2.  **Exotic Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`\n    This variant is analogous to a Majoron-emitting neutrinoless double beta decay (`0νββM`). Here, instead of two V particles, a single exotic massless particle, M (the Majoron), is emitted. Since the final state still involves multiple particles sharing the decay energy, the total energy spectrum of the two E particles remains continuous. This rules out options that suggest the spectrum becomes discrete.\n\n### Comparing the Endpoints\n\nThe core of the question is to compare the endpoint of the E particle energy spectrum in both decays. The endpoint represents the maximum possible combined kinetic energy of the two E particles.\n\n*   **Original Decay Endpoint:** In the decay `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`, the maximum energy for the `2E` system occurs when the two `V` particles carry away the minimum possible energy. In the Standard Model, neutrinos (the V particles) have a small, non-zero mass. The minimum energy they can carry away is the sum of their rest masses (`2 * m_ν * c²`). Therefore, the endpoint of the `2E` spectrum is slightly less than the total Q-value of the decay: `Endpoint_standard ≈ Q - 2 * m_ν * c²`.\n\n*   **Exotic Decay Endpoint:** In the decay `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`, the problem states that the particle M is massless. The maximum energy for the `2E` system occurs when the particle M carries away its minimum possible energy. Since M is massless, its minimum energy is zero. Thus, the two E particles can, in principle, carry away the entire Q-value of the decay. Therefore, the endpoint of the spectrum is: `Endpoint_exotic ≈ Q`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the two endpoints:\n*   `Endpoint_standard ≈ Q - 2 * m_ν * c²`\n*   `Endpoint_exotic ≈ Q`\n\nSince the mass of the V particles (`m_ν`) is greater than zero, `2 * m_ν * c²` is a positive value. This means that `Endpoint_exotic` is greater than `Endpoint_standard`.\n\nTherefore, in the exotic decay, the spectrum remains continuous, its shape is altered due to the different final state particles, and its endpoint increases compared to the original decay.\n\nThe correct option is:\n\n**B) The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.**\n\n<<<B>>>"
