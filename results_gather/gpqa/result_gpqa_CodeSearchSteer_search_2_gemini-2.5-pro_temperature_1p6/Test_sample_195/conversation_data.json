    "This problem requires the application of the principle of conservation of energy in the context of special relativity.\n\n1.  **Define the Total Energy of the System**\n    The total energy (E_total) of the relativistic harmonic oscillator system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy, U(x).\n    The relativistic energy of a particle with mass *m* and speed *v* is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²). The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is U(x) = (1/2)kx².\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system at any point *x* with speed *v* is:\n    E_total = γmc² + (1/2)kx²\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Energy**\n    We will equate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillation: the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude, A) and the equilibrium position (x=0).\n\n    *   **At maximum displacement (x = A):**\n        The mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is v = 0.\n        The Lorentz factor γ becomes γ = 1/√(1 - 0²/c²) = 1.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: U(A) = (1/2)kA².\n        The total energy at this point is E_total = (1)mc² + (1/2)kA².\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n        The mass is moving at its maximum speed, v = v_max.\n        The Lorentz factor is γ_max = 1/√(1 - v_max²/c²).\n        The potential energy is zero: U(0) = (1/2)k(0)² = 0.\n        The total energy at this point is E_total = γ_max*mc² + 0.\n\n3.  **Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\n    By the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at both points must be equal:\n    γ_max*mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²\n\n    Divide both sides by mc²:\n    γ_max = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of γ_max:\n    1/√(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)\n\n    To solve for v_max, first, invert both sides:\n    √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))\n\n    Square both sides:\n    1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate v_max²/c²:\n    v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n\n    Finally, multiply by c² and take the square root to find v_max:\n    v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²]\n\n    This result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
