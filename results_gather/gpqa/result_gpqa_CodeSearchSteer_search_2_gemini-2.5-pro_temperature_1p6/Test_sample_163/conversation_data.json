    "The search results confirm the underlying physics I used.\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2), where radial velocity curves are available for both stars, the mass ratio is given by:\n`m1 / m2 = K2 / K1`\n\nKepler's third law relates the total mass to the period and separation. For spectroscopic binaries, the observable quantities are the period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2). The total mass (M1 + M2) can be related to these observables.\n\nCombining the laws, we arrive at the expression for the total mass, which depends on the inclination angle 'i':\n`(M1 + M2) * sin^3(i) = P / (2 * pi * G) * (K1 + K2)^3`\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing binaries. This is a crucial piece of information. For an eclipse to occur, the observer's line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane. This means the inclination angle `i` is close to 90 degrees, and therefore `sin(i)` is close to 1. Assuming `sin^3(i) ≈ 1` for both systems is a valid simplification.\n\nSo the formula simplifies to:\n`M_total ≈ (P / (2 * pi * G)) * (K1 + K2)^3`\n\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, I need to calculate the ratio `M_total_1 / M_total_2`.\n\n`M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P1 / (2*pi*G)) * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3 ] / [ (P2 / (2*pi*G)) * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3 ]`\n\nThe constant term `1 / (2 * pi * G)` cancels out.\n\n`M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P1 / P2) * ( (K1_1 + K1_2) / (K2_1 + K2_2) )^3`\n\nNow I will plug in the values from the problem statement:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   P1 = 2 years\n*   K1_1 = 10 km/s\n*   K1_2 = 5 km/s\n*   K_total_1 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   P2 = 1 year\n*   K2_1 = 15 km/s\n*   K2_2 = 10 km/s\n*   K_total_2 = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n**Calculation:**\n`Ratio = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)^3`\n`Ratio = 2 * (3 / 5)^3`\n`Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`Ratio = 54 / 125`\n`Ratio = 0.432`\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432. This matches option A, which is ~0.4.\n\nThe steps and the underlying physics are sound and have been verified. I am ready to present the final answer.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must determine the total mass for each binary system and then find the ratio of system_1's mass to system_2's mass.\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = M1 + M2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2) by the following formula, which is derived from Kepler's third law:\n\nM_total * sin³(i) = [P / (2πG)] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nHere, 'i' is the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a critical piece of information, as eclipsing binaries must have an inclination angle 'i' very close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass equation to:\n\nM_total ≈ [P / (2πG)] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nThis means the total mass of the system is directly proportional to the orbital period and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\nNow, we can set up a ratio of the masses of the two systems. The constant term (1 / 2πG) will cancel out.\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³]\n\nLet's plug in the given values for each system:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Radial velocity amplitudes (K1_1, K1_2) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K_total_1) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Radial velocity amplitudes (K2_1, K2_2) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K_total_2) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio:\n\nMass Ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K_total_1 / K_total_2)³\nMass Ratio = (2 years / 1 year) * (15 km/s / 25 km/s)³\nMass Ratio = 2 * (15/25)³\nMass Ratio = 2 * (3/5)³\nMass Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nMass Ratio = 54 / 125\nMass Ratio = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432, which is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
