    "The \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics simplifies complex many-body interactions by treating nucleons within a nucleus as if they were free particles. The key assumptions that underpin this approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction involves only a single nucleon:** The incoming probe interacts with just one nucleon at a time, and the total interaction with the nucleus is the sum of these individual interactions. This ignores more complex phenomena like meson-exchange currents where the probe interacts with the force-carrying particles between nucleons.\n\n2.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon is not bound:** During the brief moment of interaction, the forces that bind the nucleon to the rest of the nucleus are considered negligible. This is a central part of the approximation, as it allows the nucleon's response to be calculated as if it were a free particle, ignoring its initial binding energy.\n\n3.  **The nucleus is transparent to the particles after the interaction:** The particles emerging after the interaction (for example, the scattered probe and the recoiling nucleon) do not interact with the other nucleons in the nucleus. This is often referred to as the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), as it assumes the outgoing particles can be described by simple plane waves rather than more complex waves distorted by the nuclear potential.\n\nAssumption 3 in the prompt, \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic,\" deals with the internal structure of the nucleon itself. While models of nucleon structure are important, the impulse approximation is primarily concerned with ignoring the effects of the nuclear environment on the nucleon (binding forces and final state interactions), not the nucleon's internal quark dynamics.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
