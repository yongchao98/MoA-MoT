    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct transition route and probability:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition:** The problem asks for the decay route from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ (a 3s orbital) to the final state |1,0,0⟩ (the 1s ground state) through a sequence of two electric dipole transitions.\n\n2.  **Recall Dipole Selection Rules:** Electric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers *l* (orbital angular momentum) and *m* (magnetic quantum number).\n    *   The change in *l* must be \\( \\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\).\n    *   The change in *m* must be \\( \\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1 \\).\n\n3.  **Determine the First Transition Step:**\n    *   **Initial State:** |3,0,0⟩, where n=3, *l*=0, *m*=0.\n    *   Since the initial state has *l*=0, the intermediate state, let's call it |n',*l*',*m*'⟩, must have *l*'=1 to satisfy the \\( \\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\) rule.\n    *   For a decay process, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease, so n'<3. The most probable decay is to the n'=2 level. Thus, the intermediate state is a |2,1,*m*'⟩ state (a 2p orbital).\n    *   Since the initial state has *m*=0, the selection rule \\( \\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1 \\) allows the intermediate state to have *m*’ = 0, +1, or -1.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n4.  **Determine the Second Transition Step:**\n    *   **Intermediate State:** |2,1,*m*'⟩ (*l*'=1).\n    *   **Final State:** |1,0,0⟩ (*l*=0, *m*=0).\n    *   The transition from *l*’=1 to *l*=0 satisfies the selection rule \\( \\Delta l = -1 \\).\n    *   The change in *m* must satisfy \\( \\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m' \\). Since *m*’ can be 0, +1, or -1, the resulting \\( \\Delta m \\) will be 0, -1, or +1, respectively. All of these are allowed by the selection rules.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Branching Ratios (Probabilities):**\n    *   The first step is the decay from a spherically symmetric |3,0,0⟩ state. In the absence of an external polarizing field, there is no preferred direction for the transition. Therefore, the decay will populate the three possible intermediate substates |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ with equal probability.\n    *   This can be confirmed more rigorously using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which shows that the transition rate is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. For a transition from an *l*=0 state to an *l*=1 state, the coefficients are the same for all three *m*' target states, leading to equal transition probabilities.\n    *   The total probability of transitioning from |3,0,0⟩ to any of the |2,1,*m*'⟩ states is 1 (assuming this is the only significant decay channel). Since there are three equally likely substates, the probability of transitioning into any specific one is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n    *   For the second step, the |2,1,*m*'⟩ state can only decay to the |1,0,0⟩ state via a dipole transition, as there are no other lower energy levels. Thus, the probability of this second step, P(|2,1,*m*'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩), is 1, regardless of the value of *m*'.\n    *   The total probability for a specific decay path is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`, the probability is \\( P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\): The route is valid, but the calculated probability is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), not \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n    *   B) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\): The route is valid, but the calculated probability is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), not \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n    *   C) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\): The route is valid, and the probability matches the calculated value.\n    *   D) ⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\): Assuming a typo and the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis of selection rules and transition probabilities, the correct transition route and probability are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
