    "To solve this problem, we must apply the laws of conservation of energy and momentum to the electron-positron annihilation. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### 1. Initial State: Energy and Momentum\n\nFirst, we determine the total energy and momentum of the electron and positron before they collide. The energy and momentum of a relativistic particle are given by:\n*   **Energy:** E = γmc²\n*   **Momentum:** p = √(E² - (mc²)²) / c\n\nWhere:\n*   γ is the Lorentz factor\n*   m is the rest mass of the particle (the electron and positron have the same mass, mₑ)\n*   c is the speed of light\n\n**For the electron:**\n*   Lorentz factor (γₑ) = 4\n*   Energy (Eₑ) = 4 * mₑc²\n*   Momentum (pₑ) is calculated as:\n    pₑc = √((4mₑc²)² - (mₑc²)²) = √(16 - 1) * mₑc² = √15 * mₑc²\n    Since it moves from the left, its momentum is in the positive x-direction.\n\n**For the positron:**\n*   Lorentz factor (γₚ) = 2\n*   Energy (Eₚ) = 2 * mₑc²\n*   Momentum (pₚ) is calculated as:\n    pₚc = √((2mₑc²)² - (mₑc²)²) = √(4 - 1) * mₑc² = √3 * mₑc²\n    Since it moves from the right, its momentum is in the negative x-direction.\n\n**Total initial energy and momentum:**\n*   **Total Energy (Eᵢ):** Eₑ + Eₚ = 4mₑc² + 2mₑc² = 6mₑc²\n*   **Total Momentum (Pᵢ):** pₑ - pₚ = (√15 - √3) * mₑc in the x-direction. There is no initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction.\n\n### 2. Final State: Two Photons\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons with equal energy are produced. One moves in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right.\n\n*   Let the energy of each photon be Eᵧ.\n*   Let the angle of the first photon with the horizontal axis be θ and the second be -θ (due to momentum conservation in the y-direction, the angles must be symmetric).\n\n### 3. Applying Conservation Laws\n\nThe total energy and momentum must be conserved before and after the collision.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy equals the total final energy.\n    Eᵢ = Eᵧ + Eᵧ = 2Eᵧ\n    6mₑc² = 2Eᵧ  =>  Eᵧ = 3mₑc²\n    Each photon has an energy of 3mₑc².\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    The momentum of a photon is p = E/c.\n    *   **Y-direction:** The initial momentum is zero. The final momentum is (Eᵧ/c)sin(θ) - (Eᵧ/c)sin(θ) = 0. This confirms the angles are symmetric.\n    *   **X-direction:** The total initial momentum must equal the total final momentum.\n        Pᵢ = P(final, x)\n        (√15 - √3) * mₑc = (Eᵧ/c)cos(θ) + (Eᵧ/c)cos(-θ)\n        (√15 - √3) * mₑc = 2 * (Eᵧ/c) * cos(θ)\n\n### 4. Calculating the Angle\n\nNow we substitute the value of Eᵧ into the momentum equation:\n(√15 - √3) * mₑc = 2 * (3mₑc²/c) * cos(θ)\n(√15 - √3) * mₑc = 6 * mₑc * cos(θ)\n\nWe can cancel mₑc from both sides to solve for cos(θ):\ncos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\nUsing the approximate values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\ncos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\nθ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\nTotal Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to option B. In cases where the initial net momentum is not zero, the angle between the resulting photons will deviate from 180 degrees.\n\n<<<B>>>"
