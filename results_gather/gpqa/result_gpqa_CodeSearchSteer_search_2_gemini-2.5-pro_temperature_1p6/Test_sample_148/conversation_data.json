    "### Analysis of the Observations\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral equals one proton. This immediately suggests the proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the two environments must arise from the presence of isomers. Enantiomers are chemically identical in a standard, achiral NMR solvent and would produce a single peak. Diastereomers, however, are chemically different compounds and will have distinct NMR spectra, showing separate peaks for corresponding protons. Therefore, the NMR data strongly suggests the presence of diastereomers.\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data:** The analysis shows two separate peaks of equal intensity that are separable by liquid chromatography (LC). This indicates the presence of two distinct compounds with different physical properties. The fact that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule, confirms that these two compounds are isomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard LC techniques.\n\n3.  **Synthesis Context:** The compound is a chemically synthesized peptide. During peptide synthesis, particularly during amino acid activation for coupling, the chiral center (alpha-carbon) of an amino acid residue can undergo epimerization. This means that an amino acid that was purely one enantiomer (e.g., the L-form) can partially convert to its other enantiomer (the D-form). If this happens at one chiral center in a peptide that has other chiral centers, the result is a mixture of two diastereomers. For instance, an L-L peptide would be contaminated with a D-L peptide. These are diastereomers and are expected to have different properties.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would create a molecule with a higher mass, which contradicts the LC-MS data showing both peaks have the mass of the expected product.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** This is highly consistent with all observations. Epimerization during synthesis would create two diastereomers. Diastereomers are distinct compounds with different NMR spectra in an achiral solvent and are separable by LC, but they have the same molecular weight. The two NMR peaks for the alpha-proton and the two LC peaks with identical mass spectra are classic signs of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n*   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight, which is inconsistent with the LC-MS data.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are indistinguishable and would give a single set of peaks, not two. Therefore, this option is inconsistent with the ¹H NMR results.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most logical explanation for the duplicate alpha-proton peaks in the ¹H NMR and the two equal-intensity LC-MS peaks with identical mass is that the peptide exists as a mixture of diastereomers, likely formed by the epimerization of one amino acid residue during chemical synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
