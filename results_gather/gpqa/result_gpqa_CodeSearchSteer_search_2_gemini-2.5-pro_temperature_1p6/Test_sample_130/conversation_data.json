    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical reaction and the interpretation of the resulting NMR spectra to determine the structure and spatial relationships within the major product molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants\n\n1.  **The Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in the ¹H NMR and two peaks (137 ppm and 165 ppm) in the ¹³C NMR.\n    *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃):\n        *   **¹H NMR:** It has two equivalent protons on the double bond, which would give a single peak. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinyl protons adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This matches.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** It has two types of carbon atoms: two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C). This would result in two peaks. The carbonyl carbon signal appears downfield (~165 ppm), and the alkene carbon signal appears upfield (~137 ppm). This also matches the given data.\n    *   Therefore, the anhydride is maleic anhydride.\n\n2.  **The Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene that will participate in the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Products\n\n1.  **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The product's molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) is consistent with the sum of the reactants' atoms (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry (Endo vs. Exo):** Diels-Alder reactions can produce two main stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is typically formed faster and is therefore the **major kinetic product**. The *exo* product is usually more stable thermodynamically and is the **minor product** under kinetic control.\n    *   The problem states a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the *endo* and *exo* adducts, respectively.\n\n3.  **Structure of the Products:**\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the newly formed double bond in the bicyclic system.\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (*anti*) to the double bond.\n\n### Step 3: Interpret the NMR Spectra of the Products\n\nThe question relies on a 2D NOESY NMR experiment. NOESY shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by chemical bonds. The key information is that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n### Step 4: Assign Proton Signals and Predict NOE correlations\n\nLet's identify the different types of protons in the product molecule and estimate their chemical shifts:\n*   **H-anhydride:** These are the two protons from the original maleic anhydride. They are now on the bicyclic framework, adjacent to the carbonyl groups of the anhydride ring. They are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry in the molecule. They should appear as a **2H singlet** at a chemical shift of approximately **3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Me-vinyl:** These are the two methyl groups attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system (from C2 and C3 of the original diene). They are equivalent and should appear as a **6H singlet**. Being attached to a C=C double bond, their signal is expected around **1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Me-bridgehead:** These are the two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (from C1 and C4 of the original diene). They are also equivalent and should appear as a **6H singlet**. Being attached to a saturated (sp³) carbon, their signal would be more shielded, around **1.0 ppm**.\n*   **CH₂-bridge:** These are the two protons of the methylene bridge (from C5 of the original diene). Their signal is mentioned in the options as a \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm,\" which may be a simplified description of one of the protons in this group.\n\nNow, let's determine which protons will show a unique NOE correlation in the major (*endo*) product.\n\n*   In the **endo adduct (major product)**, the anhydride ring is tucked under the diene-derived part of the molecule. This geometry brings the **H-anhydride** protons (at ~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the substituents on the double bond, which are the **Me-vinyl** groups (at ~1.7 ppm). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between these two groups.\n*   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is flipped away from the double bond. The distance between the **H-anhydride** protons and the **Me-vinyl** groups is large, so the corresponding NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\nThis specific spatial relationship provides the distinguishing feature between the two isomers. A NOESY cross-peak between the H-anhydride protons and the Me-vinyl protons will be present for the major product and absent for the minor product.\n\n### Step 5: Match with the Given Options\n\nWe are looking for the two resonances connected by this unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum. Based on our analysis, these are the `Me-vinyl` protons and the `H-anhydride` protons.\n\n*   **`Me-vinyl` protons:** 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n*   **`H-anhydride` protons:** 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me-bridgehead`) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`CH₂-bridge` proton).\nB) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`CH₂-bridge` proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H-anhydride`).\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me-bridgehead`) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me-vinyl`).\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me-vinyl`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H-anhydride`).\n\nOption D correctly identifies the two groups of protons that are spatially close in the major (*endo*) product and distant in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
