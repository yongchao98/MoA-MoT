    "To determine the joint probability, we must analyze the composition of the given coupled angular momentum state in terms of the uncoupled states of the individual electrons.\n\n1.  **Understand the initial state:** The system is in the coupled state |l, m> = |2, -1>. This means the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=2`, and the quantum number for its projection on the z-axis is `m=-1`.\n\n2.  **Understand the target measurement:** We want to measure the z-components of the angular momentum for each electron, `L_1z` and `L_2z`. Specifically, we are looking for the outcome where the eigenvalue for `L_1z` is `-ħ` (which corresponds to `m_l1 = -1`) and the eigenvalue for `L_2z` is also `-ħ` (corresponding to `m_l2 = -1`). This target state in the uncoupled basis is `|l1, m_l1; l2, m_l2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>`.\n\n3.  **Relate the states:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the total z-component of the angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the quantum number selection rule: `m = m_l1 + m_l2`. The coefficients that link the coupled and uncoupled bases, known as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, are zero unless this condition is met.\n\n4.  **Apply the selection rule:**\n    *   From the given initial coupled state, we have `m = -1`.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, we have `m_l1 = -1` and `m_l2 = -1`.\n    *   The sum for the target state is `m_l1 + m_l2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability:** The probability of measuring the system in the state `|1, -1; 1, -1>` when it starts in the state `|2, -1>` is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product of these two states. This inner product is precisely the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>`.\n\n    Since `m = -1` is not equal to `m_l1 + m_l2 = -2`, the selection rule is not satisfied. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n\n    ` <1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0 `\n\n    The probability is the square of this coefficient, which is `0^2 = 0`. This means it is impossible to obtain the specified measurement result.\n\nAn alternative way to see this is that the initial state `|2, -1>` is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator `L_z = L_1z + L_2z` with an eigenvalue of `-ħ`. The target state `|1, -1; 1, -1>` is also an eigenstate of `L_z`, but with an eigenvalue of `(-1 + -1)ħ = -2ħ`. Because these two states are eigenstates of the same operator (`L_z`) with different eigenvalues, they are orthogonal. The probability of measuring one state from the other is therefore zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
