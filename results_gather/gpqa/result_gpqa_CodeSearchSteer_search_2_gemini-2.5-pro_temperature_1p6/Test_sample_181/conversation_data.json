    "The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor or insulator. For this equation to be valid, several key assumptions about the device and the charge transport mechanism must be met. A thorough analysis of these conditions reveals the specific requirements for the model's accuracy.\n\nThe validity of the Mott-Gurney law rests on the following conditions:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes, contributes to the current.\n*   **Trap-Free Material:** The semiconductor or insulator is considered to be ideal, with no trapping states or energetic disorder that could immobilize the charge carriers. The presence of traps would alter the relationship between current and voltage.\n*   **Ohmic Contacts:** The electrodes are assumed to form Ohmic contacts with the material. This implies that the contacts can supply an unlimited number of charge carriers and that there is no energy barrier to their injection into the device. Consequently, the current is limited by the space charge within the material, not by the injection process. An injection barrier would lead to significant deviations from the Mott-Gurney law.\n*   **Drift-Dominated Current:** The model assumes that the current is driven entirely by the drift of charge carriers under the applied electric field. The contribution of diffusion currents, which arise from carrier concentration gradients, is considered negligible.\n*   **Negligible Intrinsic Conductivity:** The concentration of charge carriers intrinsically present in the material is assumed to be negligible compared to the density of injected charges.\n\nAnalyzing the given options based on these principles:\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This statement is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law specifically describes a drift-dominated current.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect. A Schottky contact inherently has an energy barrier, which violates the assumption of a barrier-free Ohmic contact.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement accurately summarizes the key requirements: a single-carrier system, the absence of traps, barrier-free injection (Ohmic contact), and a drift-dominated current (negligible diffusion).\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect as the model is formulated for a single type of charge carrier.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
