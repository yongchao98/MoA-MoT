    "The synthesis of product 4 proceeds through a four-step sequence starting from (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. Each step defines the structure and stereochemistry of the subsequent product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the hydroxyl group.** The starting material, (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine. This reaction protects the alcohol functional group as a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) ether. This results in the formation of **Product 1**, (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The stereochemistry at the C4 carbon remains (S).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Conjugate addition and α-alkylation.** Product 1, an α,β-unsaturated ketone, is subjected to a tandem reaction. First, lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, performs a 1,4-conjugate addition. The phenyl group (Ph) adds to the β-carbon (C3) from the face opposite to the bulky TBDMS-O group at C4, leading to a trans relationship. This establishes the stereochemistry at C3 as (R). The reaction generates a lithium enolate intermediate, which is then trapped by benzyl bromide (BnBr) in an α-alkylation step at C2. The incoming benzyl group also adds in a trans fashion relative to the adjacent phenyl group at C3. This stereoselective addition results in an (S) configuration at the C2 carbon. Thus, **Product 2** is (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n3.  **Step 3: A second α-alkylation.** Product 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (MeI). LDA is a strong, sterically hindered base that deprotonates the ketone at the less sterically hindered α-position to form the kinetic enolate. In Product 2, the C2 position is already substituted, so deprotonation occurs at C6. The subsequent alkylation with iodomethane introduces a methyl group at this position. Kinetic alkylation of cyclohexanone enolates typically results in the methyl group adding to an axial position to avoid steric hindrance during its approach. This leads to an (S) configuration at the C6 carbon. **Product 3** is therefore (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Deprotection.** The final step involves treating Product 3 with aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl). This acidic workup cleaves the TBDMS ether, regenerating the hydroxyl group at C4 without altering the established stereochemistry of the ring.\n\nThe final structure, **Product 4**, is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n<<<B>>>"
