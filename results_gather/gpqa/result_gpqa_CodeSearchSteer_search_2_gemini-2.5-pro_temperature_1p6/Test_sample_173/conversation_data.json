    "Here is a step-by-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-masses of the two fragments (m₁ and m₂) based on the initial information.\n\n*   **Initial nucleus:** Mass = M, Rest-mass energy = Mc² = 300 GeV.\n*   **Fragments:**\n    *   One fragment is twice as massive as the other: m₁ = 2m₂.\n    *   The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M.\n\nBy substituting the first equation into the second, we get:\n2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M\n3m₂ = 0.99M\n**m₂ = 0.33M**\n\nFrom this, we find the mass of the larger fragment:\n**m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M**\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   **m₁c²** = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**\n*   **m₂c²** = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released\n\nThe fission process must conserve total energy. The initial energy is the rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus. The final energy is the sum of the rest-mass energies and the kinetic energies of the two fragments. The difference in rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy (Q-value).\n\n*   **Total Kinetic Energy (T_total)** = T₁ + T₂ = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Final Rest-Mass Energy)\n*   T_total = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   T_total = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV** or **3000 MeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics\n\nIn classical mechanics, for a system initially at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momentum (p).\n*   Kinetic energy is given by T = p² / (2m).\n*   T₁ = p² / (2m₁) and T₂ = p² / (2m₂).\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   T₁ / T₂ = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 0.33M / 0.66M = 1/2.\n*   This means **T₂ = 2T₁**.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n*   T₁ + T₂ = 3000 MeV\n*   T₁ + 2T₁ = 3000 MeV\n*   3T₁ = 3000 MeV\n*   **T₁ (classical) = 1000 MeV**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct T₁ using Relativistic Mechanics\n\nFor the relativistic calculation, we use the principles of conservation of total energy and momentum.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** As before, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal: |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The total final energy (E₁ + E₂) equals the initial rest-mass energy (Mc²).\n    *   E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\nFrom the energy-momentum relation, we have p²c² = E² - (mc²)². Since the momenta are equal:\nE₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1.  E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n2.  E₁² - (198 GeV)² = E₂² - (99 GeV)²\n\nFrom equation (1), we get E₂ = 300 - E₁. Substituting this into equation (2):\nE₁² - (198)² = (300 - E₁)² - (99)²\nE₁² - 39204 = 90000 - 600E₁ + E₁² - 9801\n-39204 = 80199 - 600E₁\n600E₁ = 80199 + 39204\n600E₁ = 119403\n**E₁ = 199.005 GeV**\n\nThe kinetic energy T₁ is the total energy E₁ minus the rest-mass energy m₁c²:\n*   T₁ = E₁ - m₁c²\n*   T₁ = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n*   **T₁ (relativistic) = 1005 MeV**\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
