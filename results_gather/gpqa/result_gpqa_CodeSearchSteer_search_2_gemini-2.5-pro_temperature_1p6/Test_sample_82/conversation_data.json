    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points of the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    Concentration = 0.05 M\n    Moles = 0.0200 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol\n\n*   **Concentration after dilution:**\n    The initial 20.00 cm³ of acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    New volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    New concentration of CH₃COOH = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = **0.025 M**\n\n### 2. Volume of NaOH at Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol\n*   Concentration of NaOH = 0.1 M\n*   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = **10.00 cm³**\n\n### 3. pH at 25% Titration\n\n25% titration means that 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH has been added.\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:** 0.25 × 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³ = 0.0025 L\n*   **Moles of NaOH added:** 0.0025 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.00025 mol\n\nThe reaction `CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O` creates a buffer solution containing the remaining acetic acid and the newly formed sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n*   **Moles of CH₃COONa formed (conjugate base, A⁻):** 0.00025 mol\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH remaining (weak acid, HA):** 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\nNow, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n**pH = pKₐ + log([A⁻]/[HA])**\n\n*   **pKₐ:** -log(Kₐ) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **pH:** 4.73 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075) = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.48 = **4.25**\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n### 4. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of CH₃COOH has reacted to form 0.001 mol of CH₃COONa.\n*   **Total volume of solution:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   **Concentration of CH₃COONa:** 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**\n\nThe acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) from the salt hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak base:\n**CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻**\n\nWe need to calculate the Kₑ of the acetate ion.\n*   **Kₑ:** Kₒ / Kₐ = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow we can find the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻].\n*   **Kₑ = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]**\n*   Let [OH⁻] = x\n*   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n*   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n*   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nFinally, calculate pOH and then pH.\n*   **pOH:** -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   **pH:** 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ **4.26**\n*   pH at equivalence point ≈ **8.52**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
