    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, and is not a meso compound. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\nAn analysis of each compound reveals the following:\n\n*   **(*Z*)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule lacks a chiral center. The plane of the C=C double bond acts as a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(*3aR*,*7aS*,*E*)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The stereochemical descriptors (*3aR*, *7aS*) in the name indicate the presence of specific chiral centers. Given its complex, bridged structure, it lacks an internal plane of symmetry. A specific enantiomer like this is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(*2R*,*3S*)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (*2R,3S*) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(*2R*,*3R*)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule is a diastereomer of the meso form. The (*2R,3R*) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is one of a pair of enantiomers and is therefore chiral and optically active.\n*   **(*R*)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom attached to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center. The name specifies a single enantiomer, (*R*), which is by definition optically active.\n*   **(*1s*,*3s*,*5s*)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, also known as *cis,cis*-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has hydroxyl groups on the same side of the ring. This arrangement creates planes of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and optically inactive despite the presence of stereocenters.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An examination of the structure, (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2, shows that there are no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on this analysis, three of the compounds will exhibit optical activity: (*3aR*,*7aS*,*E*)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (*2R*,*3R*)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, and (*R*)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
