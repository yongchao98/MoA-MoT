    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the mysterious product E and its molecular symmetry:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 4 and identify B, D, and H:** The reaction `D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio is a major clue. A well-known industrial reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene (COCl₂) from carbon monoxide (CO) and chlorine (Cl₂) gas. Another possibility is the reaction of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) with chlorine (Cl₂) to form sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂), also a solvent. Let's provisionally identify **B = Cl₂** and **D = CO**, which makes **H = COCl₂ (phosgene)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 3 and identify F and G:** The reaction `C + H₂O → A (reformed) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)` involves the hydrolysis of C. Since we identified B as chlorine gas (Cl₂), the hydrolysis products likely involve chlorine compounds. When chlorine gas dissolves in water, it undergoes hydrolysis to form hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid, and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a weak acid. This perfectly matches the description of acids F and G. The fact that solid A is reformed suggests that C is a complex or an adduct of A and chlorine, which releases the chlorine upon reaction with water.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1 and the nature of C:** The reaction is `A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → C (bright red)`. This indicates that solid A reacts with eight equivalents of chlorine gas to form a bright red solid, C. While the specific identity of A is hard to determine without more information (it might be a substance that can form a stable, colored clathrate or adduct with chlorine), we can deduce that C is essentially a compound where A is loosely bound to chlorine molecules, allowing A to be regenerated.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2 and identify E:** This reaction is `C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous)`. Based on our previous deductions, this translates to `A·(Cl₂)₈ + 2 CO(g) → E`. The most plausible reaction is that the carbon monoxide reacts with the bound chlorine to form phosgene (COCl₂). Phosgene is well-known as an extremely hazardous and toxic gas, once used as a chemical weapon. Thus, we can confidently identify **E = COCl₂**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:** The final step is to find the molecular symmetry group for phosgene (COCl₂).\n    *   Phosgene has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    *   Its structure is trigonal planar.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ rotational axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two mirror planes (σᵥ): one is the plane of the molecule itself, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane, bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂v** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of the extremely hazardous product E (phosgene) is C₂v.\n\n<<<C>>>"
