    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, the most effective strategy is to completely inactivate the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is often referred to as a \"gene knockout.\" Let's analyze the potential impact of each mutation on the gene's function.\n\nThe intact gene begins with the sequence `5’-ATG TTT CTC...`, which translates to the amino acid sequence Methionine-Phenylalanine-Leucine...\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTC TAC...` translates to Methionine-Phenylalanine-Tyrosine... This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid (Leucine) is replaced by another (Tyrosine). While this could potentially alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein might still be partially or fully functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTC TAA...` translates to Methionine-Phenylalanine-STOP. This is a **nonsense mutation**, as it introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`) very early in the sequence. This causes translation to halt, producing a severely truncated protein that is only two amino acids long. A protein this short is almost certain to be non-functional, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...` translates to Methionine-Phenylalanine-Tyrosine-Alanine-Glycine-Valine... This represents at least two **missense mutations** (Leucine to Tyrosine and Threonine to Valine). Similar to Mutant 1, changing two amino acids makes protein inactivation more likely than changing one, but it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTT TAC...` translates to Methionine-Phenylalanine-Tyrosine... This is a **missense mutation**, identical to the first change in Mutant 1 and 3. As with the other missense mutations, it is not the most probable method for completely knocking out gene function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon is considered more deleterious and more likely to result in a complete loss of function than a missense mutation that only substitutes one amino acid for another. The introduction of a stop codon at the very beginning of the coding sequence in Mutant 2 is the most reliable way to ensure the resulting protein is non-functional.\n\n<<<C>>>"
