    "To determine the numerical value of \"a,\" we must use the normalization condition of the wave function. The Born rule in quantum mechanics states that the square of the modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|², represents the probability density of finding the particle at a position x. Since the particle must be somewhere in the defined space, the integral of this probability density over all possible positions must be equal to 1.\n\nThe given wave function is ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i, and the particle is only found in the interval between x=1 and x=3.\n\nFirst, we calculate the square of the modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|². For a complex number of the form c + di, the square of the modulus is c² + d². In this case, the real part is `c = a / sqrt(1 + x)` and the imaginary part is `d = -0.5`.\n\nTherefore:\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNext, we apply the normalization condition by integrating |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 and setting the result to 1:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫¹³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nFor the first part, the integral of `1/(1+x)` is `ln|1+x|`. So:\n[a² * ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3\n\nFor the second part:\n[0.25 * x] from 1 to 3\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integrals:\nPart 1: `a² * ln(1 + 3) - a² * ln(1 + 1) = a² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2))`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c)`, this simplifies to `a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)`.\n\nPart 2: `0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1 = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5`\n\nCombining the parts, our equation becomes:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value of ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\na = sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
