    "A textile dye absorbs light of certain colors and reflects or emits other colors. The color of light that a substance absorbs is complementary to the color that it emits or reflects.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the color of the light emitted by the dye. We can do this by calculating the wavelength (λ) of the emitted light from its energy (E) using the formula:\n\nλ = hc / E\n\nWhere:\n*   h = Planck's constant (approximately 4.1357 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s)\n*   c = the speed of light (approximately 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s or 3.00 x 10¹⁷ nm/s)\n*   E = energy (2.3393 eV)\n\nA common shortcut for this calculation is:\n\nλ (in nm) ≈ 1240 / E (in eV)\n\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV\nλ ≈ 530 nm\n\nNext, we identify the color associated with a wavelength of approximately 530 nm. According to the visible light spectrum, this wavelength corresponds to green light.\n\nThe color of the light absorbed by the organic compound is the complementary color of the light it emits. The complementary color of green is red. Therefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<D>>>"
