    "Based on the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified by analyzing the characteristic signals from each technique.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch (1690-1760 cm⁻¹). The presence of this peak, along with the broad O-H stretch, strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of an alkene.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n### Deduction of the Molecular Formula:\n\n1.  The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group, confirmed by both FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options A (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n\n2.  The presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is confirmed by both FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n\n3.  To determine the correct formula between C₆H₁₀O₂ and C₆H₁₂O₂, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or π-bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (oxygen atoms do not affect this calculation).\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   An alkene contains one C=C double bond, which accounts for another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total of at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n4.  Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O of the carboxylic acid, but not the additional C=C double bond.\n    *   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe spectral data consistently indicate that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The molecular formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that accommodates both a carboxylic acid functional group and a carbon-carbon double bond, as confirmed by its calculated degree of unsaturation of 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
