    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for an electron in the spin state χ = (3i, 4), we use the following formula from quantum mechanics.\n\nThe expectation value of an operator Â in a state |ψ⟩ is given by:\n⟨Â⟩ = ⟨ψ|Â|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩\n\nIn this problem:\n*   The state is |χ⟩ = `[[3i], [4]]`\n*   The operator is S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y = `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the term ⟨χ|χ⟩, which is the inner product of the state with itself. The bra vector ⟨χ| is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector |χ⟩.\n*   |χ⟩ = `[[3i], [4]]`\n*   ⟨χ| = `[-3i, 4]`\n\nNow, we calculate the inner product:\n⟨χ|χ⟩ = `[-3i, 4]` `[[3i], [4]]` = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\nNext, we calculate the term ⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩. Let's first apply the operator S_y to the state |χ⟩:\nS_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]` `[[3i], [4]]`\nS_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) `[[(0)(3i) + (-i)(4)], [(i)(3i) + (0)(4)]]`\nS_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) `[[-4i], [3i²]]`\nS_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) `[[-4i], [-3]]`\n\nNow, we multiply this result by the bra vector ⟨χ|:\n⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = `[-3i, 4]` * (ħ/2) `[[-4i], [-3]]`\n⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) [12i² - 12]\n⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) [-12 - 12]\n⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) [-24] = -12ħ\n\nFinally, we can find the expectation value:\n⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ / ⟨χ|χ⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25\n\nThis result matches option C, which can be written as -12ħ/25.\n\n<<<C>>>"
