    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K (which is ~4 °C). This is a strong indicator for heavy water (D₂O), which has a melting point of 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W is released during a reaction and its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. A prime candidate for such a gas is Deuterium gas (D₂). Each Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Other possibilities like Helium or Nitrogen are less likely in this chemical context.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, along with its very close analog. This points towards a deuterated version of a common reagent.\n    *   The reaction of X with a liquid Y produces the gas D₂ (W) and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields heavy water (B). This suggests that X is a deuterated compound and Y is a source of deuterium (like D₂O).\n    *   The most fitting candidate for X is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Its common, non-deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a widely used reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n    *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (Y = D₂O) would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is violent, produces Deuterium gas (W), and a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃). Heating Al(OD)₃ would decompose it to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). This matches the description perfectly.\n    *   The clue about the keto acid confirms this. LiAlH₄ is a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids. Therefore, it would reduce a keto acid (containing a ketone and a carboxylic acid group) to a diol (containing two alcohol groups and thus two oxygen atoms). Its milder counterpart, sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), would typically only reduce the ketone, leaving the carboxylic acid group, resulting in a product with three oxygen atoms. Thus, X is LiAlD₄.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    *   The atomic masses (using integer values for simplicity, as is common in such problems) are:\n        *   Deuterium (D): ~2 amu\n        *   Lithium (Li): ~7 amu (using the most common isotope)\n        *   Aluminum (Al): ~27 amu\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (represented by its isotope Deuterium). The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The problem asks for the sum of the cumulative masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n        *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Deuterium):** There are four Deuterium atoms. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n        *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one Aluminum atom. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Total sum** = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
