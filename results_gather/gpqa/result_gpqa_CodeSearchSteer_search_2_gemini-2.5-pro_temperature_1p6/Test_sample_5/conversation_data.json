    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given potential:**\n    The potential is given in two-dimensional polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\n2.  **Convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates:**\n    To simplify the problem, we convert the polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates using the standard transformations:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r² = x² + y²\n\n    Substitute these into the potential equation:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x)²\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\n    Combine the terms with x²:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\n    V(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n3.  **Separate the potential:**\n    The potential in Cartesian coordinates separates into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction. This is known as a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n    *   Vₓ(x) = 2kx²\n    *   Vᵧ(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\n4.  **Determine the energy spectrum for each dimension:**\n    The energy for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(q) = 1/2 mω²q² is given by Eₙ = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        We have Vₓ(x) = 2kx². We can write this as 1/2 (4k)x². Comparing this to the standard form 1/2 mωₓ²x², we identify the effective spring constant as kₓ = 4k.\n        The angular frequency for the x-oscillator is:\n        ωₓ = √(kₓ/m) = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m)\n        The energy eigenvalues for the x-dimension are:\n        Eₙₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħωₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ * 2√(k/m)\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        We have Vᵧ(y) = 1/2 ky². Here, the effective spring constant is kᵧ = k.\n        The angular frequency for the y-oscillator is:\n        ωᵧ = √(kᵧ/m) = √(k/m)\n        The energy eigenvalues for the y-dimension are:\n        Eₙᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\n5.  **Calculate the total energy spectrum:**\n    Since the Hamiltonian is separable, the total energy E is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions.\n    E = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\n    E = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ * 2√(k/m) + (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n    Factor out the common term ħ√(k/m):\n    E = [2(nₓ + 1/2) + (nᵧ + 1/2)] ħ√(k/m)\n    Distribute the 2:\n    E = (2nₓ + 1 + nᵧ + 1/2) ħ√(k/m)\n    Combine the constant terms:\n    E = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 3/2) ħ√(k/m)\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
