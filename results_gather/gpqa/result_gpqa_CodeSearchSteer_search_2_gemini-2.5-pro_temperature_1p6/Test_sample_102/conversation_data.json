    "To determine the most effective reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of each substituent is necessary. The target molecule has three groups—acetyl, bromo, and nitro—all in a *meta* relationship to one another (at positions 1, 3, and 5). This substitution pattern is key to devising a high-yield synthesis strategy.\n\nAn evaluation of the proposed options reveals the following:\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because it involves a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction on aniline (produced in step ii). Aniline, being a Lewis base, reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and preventing the acylation reaction from occurring.\n*   **Option B** is not ideal. It begins by creating bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration step would therefore yield a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-bromonitrobenzene, not the required *meta*-substituted product, making this a low-yield pathway for the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n*   **Option C** contains a futile cycle. The first four steps (nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then reaction with H3PO2) convert benzene into aniline and then back to benzene, making the sequence chemically illogical.\n*   **Option D** presents the most chemically sound route to the target compound, specifically within its first three steps.\n    1.  **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene produces acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is an electron-withdrawing group and a *meta*-director for subsequent substitutions. This is a crucial first step as Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work well on rings that are already strongly deactivated by groups like a nitro group.\n    2.  **ii) Br2/FeBr3:** The bromination of acetophenone occurs next. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, it directs the incoming bromine atom to the *meta* position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** The final group, a nitro group, is added. In 3-bromoacetophenone, both existing substituents direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C-5). The acetyl group directs *meta* (to C-5), and the bromo group directs *ortho* and *para* (with the *para* position relative to it being C-5). This reinforcement ensures a high yield of the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nWhile the sequence in option D continues with further steps that would alter the final product, the first three steps represent a valid and high-yield pathway to synthesize the target molecule. The question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis, which this option does.\n\n<<<D>>>"
