    "This question requires identifying the specific stereoisomer, the EXO product, of a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, also known as a Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n1.  **Reactants Analysis**:\n    *   **Diene**: 2,5-dimethylthiophene. In this reaction, the thiophene ring provides the four π-electrons for the cycloaddition.\n    *   **Dienophile**: Furan-2,5-dione, commonly known as maleic anhydride, provides the two π-electrons.\n    *   **Condition**: The reaction is conducted under heat, which typically favors the thermodynamically more stable product.\n\n2.  **Product Structure Analysis**:\n    *   The reaction is a cycloaddition, forming a new six-membered ring.\n    *   The diene is a thiophene derivative, meaning it contains a sulfur atom. This sulfur atom will form a bridge in the resulting bicyclic adduct. A sulfur bridge is referred to as an \"epithio\" bridge. This eliminates options B and D, which describe an \"epoxy\" bridge (which would come from a furan diene).\n    *   The dienophile is maleic anhydride, which forms an isobenzofuran-1,3-dione core structure in the product.\n    *   Therefore, the product's base name is **4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**. Both options A and C share this name, differing only in their stereochemistry.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry (EXO vs. ENDO)**:\n    *   In a Diels-Alder reaction, two main stereochemical outcomes are possible: ENDO and EXO.\n    *   The **ENDO** product is typically formed faster (is the kinetic product) due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. In the ENDO adduct, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the main bridge of the diene system.\n    *   The **EXO** product is typically more stable (is the thermodynamic product) because it is less sterically hindered. In the EXO adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the sulfur bridge. Since the reaction is run with heat, the formation of the more stable EXO product is favored.\n    *   The question explicitly asks for the EXO product. We must now determine the correct IUPAC stereochemical descriptors (R/S) for this isomer.\n\n4.  **Assigning Stereochemical Descriptors**:\n    *   We are choosing between (3aR,4R,7S,7aS) and (3aR,4S,7R,7aS).\n    *   The stereochemistry at the ring fusion carbons (3a and 7a) is determined by the dienophile's cis geometry and is the same in both options (3aR, 7aS), assuming a standard orientation for numbering.\n    *   The difference lies at carbons 4 and 7, which bear the methyl groups.\n    *   In the **EXO** adduct, the bulky anhydride part of the molecule is oriented away from the sulfur bridge. This arrangement places the methyl groups at C4 and C7 in a *cis* relationship with the sulfur bridge and *trans* to the hydrogens at the ring junction (C3a and C7a).\n    *   Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities to the chiral centers of the EXO adduct reveals the specific stereochemistry. For the enantiomer shown in the provided options, the correct configuration is **(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)**.\n\nTherefore, option C correctly describes the EXO product with the appropriate name and stereochemistry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
