    "To find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$, we can use the formula derived from the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta A$ of an operator $A$ is given by the square root of the variance, which is calculated as:\n$\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n\nHere, $\\langle A \\rangle$ represents the expectation value of the operator $A$, and $\\langle A^2 \\rangle$ is the expectation value of the operator $A^2$. The expectation value of an operator $A$ for a system in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is calculated by $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nThe problem provides the following:\n*   The matrix for the operator $P_z$:\n    $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   The state of the system as a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   The corresponding bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose:\n    $\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe will proceed with the following steps:\n1.  Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.\n2.  Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\n3.  Substitute these values into the uncertainty formula to find $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\nFirst, we apply the $P_z$ operator to the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right) = \\hbar \\left( 1/4 + 0 - 1/4 \\right) = 0$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\nFirst, we find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\left( 1/4 + 0 + 1/4 \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n\nUsing the formula for uncertainty:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
