    "B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.\n\nReasoning:\nThe SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14 complex does indeed function as a heterodimer in a proofreading/mismatch repair mechanism, and the nsp10 cofactor enhances the 3'-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity of nsp14. However, the statement incorrectly claims that the complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA. In fact, as an exonuclease, its function is to *catalyze* the breakdown (hydrolysis) of RNA, including dsRNA, to remove mismatched nucleotides. Its role is to degrade RNA from the 3' end, not to protect it from breakdown. Therefore, this statement contains a factual error regarding the fundamental enzymatic activity of the complex.\n\nAll other statements are supported by scientific literature:\n*   A) This accurately describes the -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanism in Coronaviruses, which uses a slippery sequence and a pseudoknot to produce ORF1a and ORF1ab polyproteins. The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting signals are known to be highly similar.\n*   C) Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein can induce apoptosis by activating caspase-8 (a hallmark of the extrinsic pathway) without affecting the levels of Bcl-2 (a key regulator of the intrinsic pathway).\n*   D) While the exact relationship is highly complex, it is established that the mechanical properties and conformational dynamics of the RNA pseudoknot are critical for inducing ribosomal frameshifting. The tension created as the ribosome unwinds the pseudoknot, which involves different conformations, is central to the frameshifting mechanism. Though a direct linear correlation may be an oversimplification, the link between conformations under tension and frameshifting rate is a valid concept in the field. The error in statement B is a more direct and fundamental contradiction of the enzyme's known function.\n\n<<<B>>>"
