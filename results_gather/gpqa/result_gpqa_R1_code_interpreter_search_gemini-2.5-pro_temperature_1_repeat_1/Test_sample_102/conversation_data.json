    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe substituents are all **meta** with respect to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃)**: A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br)**: A deactivating group but an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂)**: A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Amino group (-NH₂)**: A strongly activating group and an **ortho-, para-director**. (Relevant as it's formed by reducing a nitro group, a common tactic).\n\n### 3. Evaluate Direct Synthesis vs. Indirect Synthesis\n\nA direct synthesis would involve adding the three groups sequentially to the benzene ring. For example:\n*   Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration.\n*   Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n\nLet's consider the sequence: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration.\n1.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone**. The -COCH₃ group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone**. Bromine adds meta to the acetyl group. This works.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   In 3-bromoacetophenone, the -COCH₃ group (at C1) directs meta (to C5). The -Br group (at C3) directs ortho/para (to C2, C4, C6). The directing effects are conflicting.\n    *   Furthermore, adding a third deactivating group to a ring that already has two is difficult and typically results in low yields. The question asks for a **high-yield** synthesis.\n\nThis suggests that a more sophisticated, indirect route is required. The presence of steps like `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO₂ to -NH₂) and `NaNO₂/HCl` followed by `H₃PO₂` (diazotization and deamination, i.e., removal of the -NH₂ group) in the options strongly hints at a common synthetic strategy where an amino group is used as a powerful director and then removed at the end.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Options with the Deamination Strategy\n\nThe sequence `... -> Fe/HCl -> NaNO₂/HCl -> H₃PO₂` implies that a nitro group is introduced, used to create an amino directing group, and then this group is removed from the molecule. Let's trace the options with this in mind.\n\n*   **Option A**: Starts with bromination, then nitration. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the ring is too strongly deactivated by the nitro and bromo groups. So, **A is incorrect**.\n*   **Option B**: The sequence of steps i-iv (`Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline -> Diazonium salt -> Benzene`) is circular and makes no sense. So, **B is incorrect**.\n*   **Option D**: Involves reacting aniline with `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`. This Friedel-Crafts acylation is problematic on aniline. Even if we assume it works or that it implies N-acylation, the subsequent steps do not logically lead to the target without missing steps (like hydrolysis). For example, step (vi) `NaNO₂/HCl` requires a primary amine, but the product from step (v) would be an acetanilide (an amide). So, **D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: Let's trace this sequence carefully. This path turns out to be a clever, multi-step synthesis that achieves the desired product in high yield.\n\n    i.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone**.\n        *   An acetyl group is added. It's a meta-director.\n\n    ii. **Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone**.\n        *   The meta-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to position 3.\n\n    iii. **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**.\n        *   This is a key step. The directing effects of -COCH₃ (meta) and -Br (ortho, para) are conflicting. While the 5-nitro isomer is also formed, the 4-nitro isomer is a significant product that is required for the subsequent steps of this sequence.\n\n    iv. **3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone**.\n        *   The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. This introduces a powerful activating, ortho,para-directing group.\n\n    v.  **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**.\n        *   This is the crucial step for regiocontrol. We are nitrating the ring. Let's look at the directors:\n            *   -NH₂ (at C4) is a powerful activator and directs ortho/para (to C3-occupied, C5).\n            *   -COCH₃ (at C1) is a deactivator and directs meta (to C5).\n            *   -Br (at C3) is a deactivator and directs ortho/para (to C2, C6).\n        *   Both the strongest activating group (-NH₂) and the -COCH₃ group direct the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This concerted direction ensures the reaction is regioselective and high-yield.\n\n    vi. **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO₂/HCl → Diazonium salt**.\n        *   The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n\n    vii. **Diazonium salt + H₃PO₂ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n        *   The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis entire sequence successfully constructs the target molecule with excellent control over the placement of the substituents, fulfilling the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n<<<C>>>"
