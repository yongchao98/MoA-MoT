    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but doesn't distinguish between the choices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   The problem states there are no signals corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens, which means there are no C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated carboxylic acids, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   The key to solving the problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplets) observed:\n        *   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** According to the n+1 rule, this means the proton(s) giving this signal are coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n            *   Coupling to one proton (n=1) gives a **d**oublet (n+1=2).\n            *   Coupling to two protons (n=2) gives a **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n            *   Coupling to three protons (n=3) gives a **q**uartet (n+1=4).\n            *   Therefore, the proton is adjacent to a -CH group, a -CH₂ group, and a -CH₃ group.\n        *   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** Using the same logic, this means a different proton in the molecule is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n            *   Coupling to one proton (n=1) gives a **d**oublet (n+1=2).\n            *   Coupling to two protons (n=2) gives a **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n            *   Coupling to another, different set of two protons (n=2) gives a second **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n            *   Therefore, this proton is adjacent to a -CH group and two different -CH₂ groups.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    We will now examine the structure of each option to see if it contains protons that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. We will use the simple n+1 rule, as is standard for such problems unless diastereotopic effects are explicitly considered.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n        (2)H- C --CH₃\n              |\n        (3)H- C --CH₃\n              |\n        (4)   CH₂\n              |\n        (5)   CH₃\n        ```\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the two protons at C4 (2H), and the three protons of its methyl group (3H). This would give a **dtq**.\n        *   However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to a -CH group and two -CH₂ groups. Thus, there is no **dtt** signal. Option A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n        (2)H- C --CH₂CH₃\n              |\n        (3)H- C --CH₂CH₃\n              |\n        (4)   CH₂\n              |\n        (5)   CH₃\n        ```\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the two protons at C4 (2H), and the two protons of its ethyl group's -CH₂- (2H). This would give a **dtt**.\n        *   However, no proton is adjacent to a -CH, a -CH₂, and a -CH₃ group simultaneously. Thus, there is no **dtq** signal. Option B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n        (2)   CH₂\n              |\n        (3)H- C --CH₃\n              |\n        (4)H- C --CH₃\n              |\n        (5)   CH₃\n        ```\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the two protons at C2 (2H), the proton at C4 (1H), and the three protons of its methyl group (3H). This would give a **tdq** (or dtq).\n        *   However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to a -CH group and two -CH₂ groups. Thus, there is no **dtt** signal. Option D is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n        This condensed formula is best interpreted by first determining its chemical formula (C₉H₁₈O₂) and then identifying its structure by finding the longest carbon chain containing the carboxyl group. The correct IUPAC name for this structure is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n        ```\n                           CH₃(a)\n                           |\n        (e)CH₃-CH₂(d)-CH(4) - CH(3) - CH₂(2) - COOH(1)\n                                    |\n                                    CH₂(b) - CH₃(c)\n        ```\n        *   Let's find the proton that gives a **dtq**: The proton at **C4** is coupled to H at C3 (1H, gives a doublet), the two protons at C5 (the -CH₂- group `d`, gives a triplet), and the three protons of its methyl group (`a`, gives a quartet). This proton's signal is a **dtq**.\n        *   Let's find the proton that gives a **dtt**: The proton at **C3** is coupled to H at C4 (1H, gives a doublet), the two protons at C2 (gives a triplet), and the two protons of its ethyl group's -CH₂- (`b`, gives another triplet). This proton's signal is a **dtt**.\n        *   This molecule is the only one in the list that has protons corresponding to both a **dtq** and a **dtt** signal.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe compound must be 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, which is represented by the formula in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
