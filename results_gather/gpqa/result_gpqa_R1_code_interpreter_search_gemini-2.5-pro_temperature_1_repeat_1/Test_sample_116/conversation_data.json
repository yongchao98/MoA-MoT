    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept:** The question asks to identify which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in the molecule's stable conformation.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** The positions ortho to the inter-ring bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted.\n        *   At positions 2 and 2', there are dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n        *   At positions 6 and 6', there are nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** In biphenyls, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions, they can clash with each other, preventing free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. This restricted rotation is called \"atropisomerism\".\n    *   The nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups are sufficiently bulky to hinder rotation. This locks the two phenyl rings in a non-planar (twisted) conformation.\n    *   Next, we check for symmetry. In this twisted conformation, there is no plane of symmetry that can cut the molecule into two identical halves, nor is there a center of inversion.\n    *   Because the molecule is non-planar and lacks these symmetry elements, it is chiral. Chiral molecules can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and thus exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 1 shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Let's break down the name. \"Propanoate\" indicates a 3-carbon chain with a carboxylate group. \"Methyl\" means it's an ester with a methyl group (CH3O-). \"2-hydroxy\" means an -OH group is on carbon-2. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** We look for a chiral center. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine Carbon-2 (the one with the -OH group):\n        1.  It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        2.  It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3).\n        3.  It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3).\n        4.  It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n    *   Since Carbon-2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 2 shows optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It's a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Chirality Check:**\n        *   There is no carbon atom with four different single-bonded substituents, so there is no chiral center.\n        *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry. A plane can be imagined passing through the C=O bond and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 3 does not show optical isomerism.\n\n5.  **Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** Fumarate is the trans-isomer of butenedioate. Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups (-COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:**\n        *   There are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry. It also possesses a center of inversion (a point in the middle of the C=C bond).\n    *   The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 4 does not show optical isomerism.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound 1 is optically active (due to atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 is optically active (due to a chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 is not optically active (achiral).\n    *   Compound 4 is not optically active (achiral).\n\n    Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
