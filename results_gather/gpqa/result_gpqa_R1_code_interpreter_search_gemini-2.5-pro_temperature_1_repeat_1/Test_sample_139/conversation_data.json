    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This suggests isotopes like Deuterium (D), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, ¹⁸O, etc. are involved.\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W, where W's molecules have an equal number of protons and neutrons.** Let's analyze potential gases (W):\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton (p) and 1 neutron (n). The D₂ molecule has 2p and 2n. This fits.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): Each ¹⁴N atom has 7p and 7n. The N₂ molecule has 14p and 14n. This fits.\n        *   ¹⁶O₂ (Oxygen gas): Each ¹⁶O atom has 8p and 8n. The O₂ molecule has 16p and 16n. This fits.\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide): C has 6p, 6n. O has 8p, 8n. The CO molecule has 14p and 14n. This fits.\n        *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): H has 1p, 0n. D has 1p, 1n. The HD molecule has 2p and 1n. This does not fit.\n    *   **Clue 4 & 5: A precipitate G forms. Heating G releases substance B, which has a melting point near 277 K.**\n        *   277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This value is remarkably close to 277 K.\n        *   This strongly implies that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Connecting the clues:** If heating G releases D₂O (B), then G is likely a deuterated hydroxide, a compound that loses D₂O upon heating (a process similar to dehydration). The fact that D₂O is a product points to Deuterium being a key component of the system. This also supports D₂ as the identity of gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We need a substance (X) containing Deuterium that reacts to form a deuterated hydroxide precipitate (G) and D₂ gas (W).\n    *   **Clue 6: The organic chemistry connection.** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   Let's consider common deuterated reagents. A very powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues.\n    *   **Reaction with a keto acid:** A keto acid contains both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. For example, pyruvic acid (CH₃-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both groups to alcohols (-OH). The product would be a diol, CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH), which has **2 oxygen atoms**. This matches the clue perfectly.\n    *   **The violent reaction:** LiAlD₄ reacts extremely violently with water. Let's assume the liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (s) + 4 D₂O (l) → LiOD (aq) + Al(OD)₃ (s)↓ + 4 D₂ (g)↑`\n        *   This reaction is violent.\n        *   Gas W = D₂. As established, it has an equal number of protons and neutrons (2p, 2n). This fits.\n        *   Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Aluminium hydroxide is a well-known gelatinous precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Decomposition of G:** Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose.\n        *   Reaction: `2 Al(OD)₃ (s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ (s) + 3 D₂O (g)`\n        *   This reaction releases substance B = D₂O.\n        *   The melting point of B (D₂O) is ~277 K. This fits.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   We identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic number (number of protons).\n        *   Hydrogen (H/D): Atomic number (Z) = 1  **(Lightest)**\n        *   Lithium (Li): Z = 3\n        *   Aluminium (Al): Z = 13 **(Heaviest)**\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved (D = ²H, Al = ²⁷Al).\n        *   **Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄. The mass number of D is 2.\n          Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium (Al) in LiAlD₄. The mass number of the stable isotope of Al is 27.\n          Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:**\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from D) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
